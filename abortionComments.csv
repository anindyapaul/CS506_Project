doa17ue,AFGNCAAP_Paradigm,"It's necessary. Period.Women will seek them out anyway, whether they are legal or not. Illegal abortions are dangerous and lead to sterility and death.Without legal, safe abortions, women WILL die."
doa1hmq,Sarugan,That's completely true.
doa21v6,grandpasplace,"> It's necessary. Period.Shouldn't that be, It's necessary when there is no period? :p"
doa2z9c,AngelaBerserkel,"This is the correct answer. Thread closed, thank you all."
doa5bn5,Emperor_Aurelian,So because people will do things anyways we shouldnt make it illegal? Poaching elephants is dangerous but we shouldnt make legal because people still do it.
dofcsg6,qi1,"When a society holds that a particular course of action is wrong because it unjustifiably violates the rights of others, it must make such an action illegal. Assault is illegal, as is theft, and any number of other violations of other human beings' rights. This principle is usually so obvious that we hardly give it a moment's thought. You can't just hit people for no reason. Or take their stuff.But the illegality of assault and theft doesn't, in fact, stop those things from occurring.They happen anyway, although they are illegal. We don't argue that because people continue to commit such actions, we should just make them legal and not worry about the morality involved.No one calls for publicly-funded assault centers where angry and violent people can beat up victims in a controlled setting. Anyone who argued for such a thing would be rightly viewed as crazy.And if they responded by saying that ""assaults are going to happen anyway,"""" we would instantly recognize that the point has been missed."
dofeubl,AFGNCAAP_Paradigm,>No one calls for publicly-funded assault centers where angry and violent people can beat up victims in a controlled setting. Anyone who argued for such a thing would be rightly viewed as crazyBoxing and MMA
doff4t3,qi1,That's pretty far off what I was getting at. They aren't publicly funded regardless.
doff9w8,AFGNCAAP_Paradigm,"No, we just sell tickets to them, and they get product sponsers.Edit: oh, and in the U.S. no federal funds can be used for abortions."
doffuqn,qi1,"Oh of course.Prorated salaries, same facilities, same staff, same waiting rooms and counselors, and we are supposed to believe that tax dollars are not used to facilitate abortion? Give me a break.But that's a debate for another thread."
dofgh62,AFGNCAAP_Paradigm,"You can look up planned parenthood's tax records, they're a matter of public record.If you have proof they're are using federal funds for abortions, then you need to report them. That's illegal."
doa20ls,multiple4,"Only problem I have with abortions is when the baby is literally alive in the mothers stomach. Once the baby is a living human being I don't see how anyone could possibly see it as ok to kill that baby.My definition of living is when the baby is kicking, has all it's limbs and body parts, it has a brain, it has all the characteristics of a human baby except it is in the womb. Killing that baby is wrong.I want this line to be drawn before I support abortions, otherwise we will have people trying to legalize these ridiculously late term abortions which are completely fucking disgusting and put a stain on our society."
doa26e1,AFGNCAAP_Paradigm,"Women will seek them out anyway, which will result in 2 deaths, instead of 1.Legally, should a line be drawn? Sure, I guess? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯But that line should be drawn by **DOCTORS**, not politicians."
doa2e9z,multiple4,"Heroin is illegal, people seek it out, and people die from it as a result.If a woman seeks out an abortion with a few weeks to go in her pregnancy and she dies as a result, I'm sorry but you died trying to kill a living baby, your own baby. Not saying I would want a woman to die, but the whole thing could be avoided if she didn't wait until the last second to get an abortion. It's irresponsible and immoral to wait that long and have to kill a living baby."
doa2m3p,AFGNCAAP_Paradigm,">Heroin is illegal, people seek it out, and people die from it as a result.That's not a good thing...>If a woman seeks out an abortion with a few weeks to go in her pregnancy and she dies as a result, I'm sorry but you died trying to kill a living baby, your own baby. Not saying I would want a woman to die,That's exactly what you just said.> but the whole thing could be avoided if she didn't wait until the last second to get an abortion. Or if she had a proper doctor perform the procedure. >It's irresponsible Yes it is.>and immoralI do not make any moral argument in my stance one way or the other. The morality of abortion is irrelevant to me.It is a necessary, practical procedure."
doa46k1,DLTMIAR,"Meh, if the baby can't survive without the mother, it is a part of the mother and at the mother's mercy"
doa73re,Lil-Lanata,"You can make that line for yourself.You shouldn't get to make it for anyone else. Your moral standing on when abortions are acceptable in yours, and shouldn't impact any other person.There are also many reasons why late term abortion is needed. Health of the mother, deformities that cannot be picked up earlier etc. They're not a stain on society. They are a medical procedure that people have because they have decided they need it."
doa4g7f,Emperor_Aurelian,And so will babies if abortion is legalize
doa4hpg,AFGNCAAP_Paradigm,"1 dead body, or 2.Which would you rather have?"
doa5gg1,Emperor_Aurelian,On the net less dead bodies so no abortion just because you don't like responsibility
doa6n21,AFGNCAAP_Paradigm,"Okay, so, ignore the facts. Got it."
doa73yl,Emperor_Aurelian,You assume that the amount of abortion will be the same when its legal vs illegal. It will drop drastically if it is illegal. Those less abortions and less dead bodies. What fact am I ignoring?
doa76oi,AFGNCAAP_Paradigm,Also:More dead women.More neglected and abused children. More poverty.
doa7anm,Emperor_Aurelian,Less dead women. Since like half the aborted childern are women.So better dead than shitty childhood?
doa7m8q,AFGNCAAP_Paradigm,">Less dead women. Since like half the aborted childern are women.You know exactly what I mean, don't play semantics. >So better dead than shitty childhood?That's a moral argument. I'm not making a moral argument. I'm making a practical one.The morality of abortion is irrelevant to me."
doa1up1,Nintendroid,/thread
doa49ai,KommandCBZhi,"I consider myself to be pro-life, however, I feel it should remain legal, but used sparingly, with restrictions on late-term abortions."
doa1gkm,CyanManta,"If you don't like it, don't have one.And if you think defunding Planned Parenthood is the answer, then you don't know what Planned Parenthood actually does. The vast majority of their money goes toward education and birth control availability, things that prevent unplanned pregnancy from happening in the first place."
doa53lg,FuglytheBear,"You seem to forget the current war on birth control comes from the same direction. Don't you know if you don't want a baby, just don't have sex. It's as easy as that. /s"
doa5wia,Lady_Lyanna,Right? I mean that's been working so well.
dofcvfk,qi1,"> ""If you don't like it, don't have one.""> ""Don't like rape, don't rape anyone."" > ""Don't like child abuse, don't abuse a child.""Of course none of these make any sense. Because in all of these cases, you are marginalizing an entire group of people."
doa3fiw,Kroovistos,"If a family member has the right to ""pull the plug"" of a relative or friend that is brain dead, why can a mother not abort an unborn child that doesn't shown brain activity? Fetuses don't exhibit regular brain waves until around 25 weeks in.I think a bigger subject here is: ""What is considered being alive?"" If we view being alive as biological then why do we allow people to end lives out of compassion and empathy (those who are in comas, brain dead, etc.)? If we consider being alive as physiological (being aware eg: having consciousness) then why does the argument of ethics on abortion still exist? (for those of you that believe having organs/electrical signals that can move limbs as being alive, would you consider grown tissue in a lab to have rights? Would you consider the organs of organ donors to have rights inherent to the donor? Serious question)"
doa5y2t,untakenu,"No, it is 6-8 weeks that brain activity properly starts."
doadkun,Kroovistos,"I said ""regular"" brain waves, as in steady, non-irregular brain waves. This doesn't happen until 25 weeks after conception. Prior to 25 weeks, a fetus' brain only shows small bursts of activity without sustained firing of neurons.Source: Gilbert, Scott F. DevBio, a Companion to Developmental Biology, Eighth Edition. Sinauer Associates Inc., March 2006. Chapter 2, subsection 1."
doa4wdp,Emperor_Aurelian,Because brain dead people aren't getting better. While that fetus will be a child in 9 months
doa5plp,Kroovistos,"That's a respectable point of view. As someone that's worked in hospice care, I've seen plenty of people that were put in hospice with a terminal diagnosis end up making a recovery. If we're playing the game of stats how can we be sure that many of the people with no brain activity can't/won't make a recovery? Just the same, how can we assure that a fetus won't develop into a serial killer when raised by parents that may not want it? When it comes to the betterment of society, namely the person carrying that child, doesn't the decision ultimately come down to them since the subject in question (whether fetus or brain-dead) can't represent themselves?"
dofd2vt,qi1,"I'll explain why:A person can't be considered brain dead until they are determined to have an *irreversible* loss of brain function.A unborn child is reasonably expected to gain full brain functioning (as you and I did at one point in our lives). Furthermore, brain development happens far earlier than you may expect, beginning in the first [few weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_embryogenesis) of a pregnancy."
doa14eu,twilightsentinel,You do what you want with your body. I am just happy that you are having it done in a clean and safe facility by professionals.
doa48by,DLTMIAR,But Jeesuss doesn't approve of baby killin and will wipe you out with a hurricane
doa33n3,ComicBookFanatic97,"Not my fetus, not my problem."
dofd63m,qi1,"*Child abuse. Not my child, not my problem.*Same line of thinking?"
dofexj9,ComicBookFanatic97,"Are you familiar with the concept of ""reductio ad absurdum""? It's when you take your opponent's argument, extend it to ridiculous proportions, and then criticize the result. That's what you're doing. It's not a valid argument tactic. If you don't like abortions, don't have one. What business is it of yours if someone else feels the need to terminate her pregnancy?"
doff2e5,qi1,"Ridiculous proportions?Child abuse, slavery, murder, assault, etc. are all violations of other human beings' rights. Someone who is pro-life views abortion as a violation of the rights of the human being in the womb. You can quickly dismiss those arguments as ridiculous if it is easy or convenient for yourself but that doesn't make them invalid."
dofghxg,ComicBookFanatic97,"Personally, I would argue that since there are seven characteristics of life, a fetus can't be considered alive until it satisfies all seven. In addition, there are several instances where abortion is medically necessary, like if having the child would kill the mother. Then, there's cases of rape. I certainly don't subscribe to the notion that if the rape of a woman results in pregnancy, she should have to carry the baby to term. I don't approve of abortion in a lot of cases, but I'm not going to tell a woman that she can't get one. It's none of my business."
dofibne,qi1,What are those seven characteristics of life you believe in personally?
dofilo8,ComicBookFanatic97,"To be considered living according to biologists, the organism in question must:1. Respond to its enviornment2. Maintain homeostasis3. Have the capacity to reproduce4. Have a metabolism and be able to respirate5. Be able to grow and change6. Be made of cells7. Be able to pass its traits on to offspringA fetus doesn't meet all of these requirements until it's essentially fully formed. Once it does though, I consider it a human."
dofjzvb,qi1,"Looks like a lot of people can be poisoned and dismembered at will then if we use your list.> 1. Respond to its environmentThen people in a coma aren't human or alive.> 3. Have the capacity to reproduceThen infants, children, elderly, and those who are infertile aren't human or alive.> 4. Have a metabolism and be able to respirateThen people on a ventilator aren't aren't human or alive.> 7. Be able to pass its traits on to offspringThen infants, children, elderly, and those who are infertile aren't human or alive."
dofkgga,ComicBookFanatic97,"Those are characteristics that apply to a typical example of a living thing. They're general and they don't take exceptions into account. Infants count as alive because they have the *capacity* to reproduce and pass on traits. They gain that ability eventually. Believe me, I brought those exact points up to my biology teacher in high school and he told me exactly what I'm telling you."
dogdyyr,qi1,"Likewise, a fetus has the capacity to reproduce and pass traits. They gain that ability eventually. Before conception, there is no individual growing and developing. After, it's just growth and development throughout the normal course of a human life."
doa14lz,Dogenewnew,Pro choice
doa2nyh,,"Nobody should ever have to have an abortion, but if they do, they should have good access to safe ones.I'm a bit strange in that I don't believe life itself has any value. I believe *relationships* are priceless. I'd care infinitely more about the death of my father than the death of someone across the world I don't know. I can sympathize with their loved ones, but I don't really get affected by it at all. Why? They're both life. It's all the same. Because the relationship is what matters.In the case of an unborn fetus, there's really only one person that has a relationship with it, and that's the mother. Thus, in the case of termination, they're really the only person who can make that decision (not that I believe it's even alive until a certain time)."
dv6sisk,maarhoe,You're taking away the chance for that life to eventually develop these relationships though. You could compare it to a very lonely and isolated person. Im not going to feel morally justified in killing someone like that just because they have no friends. But I cam find myself in that worldview.
doa30qm,PaperCutRugBurn,"As a man, I'd say my opinion is pretty moot. Not my body, not my decision. If I really wanted a kid, I should have discussed that with the person before knocking them up. It's not a woman's responsibility to go through with a pregnancy so that a man doesn't get sad."
doa4uef,Emperor_Aurelian,Its not her body that is being destroyed.
doa5ccv,PaperCutRugBurn,"Ah, the ol' voice for the voiceless argument. No one's body is being destroyed, it's not a person. Asking a woman to go through with pregnancy so that it can become a person, is unfair and controlling and pretty gross."
doa5ns8,Emperor_Aurelian,Yes. The old its not alive argument. Turn the child into a object so you can pretend you aren't killing it. Pretty gross.
doa7fyu,PaperCutRugBurn,"Well, once you have something growing inside your body, then you can decide when it is and isn't alive and what you can and can't do about it."
doa7tu8,Emperor_Aurelian,"Life isn't subjective. That fetus is alive, growing doing life things. Your opinion on being a mother doesn't change that."
doa8jqh,PaperCutRugBurn,"I feel like you're still using the term in a definitive way, that you don't actually agree with. Life and Alive and Living. Are you Vegan? Do you value all life, and alive and living the same? Because you'd die if that's true. Corn is alive, you gonna protest corn farmers? Pig farms? Putting down a dying horse? It's alive, so where's your picket line? What you mean is 'Human Life' isn't subjective. But the amount of value you place on any particular living thing isn't the gold standard. It's not your 'living thing' to make decisions about, just stay out of it, like you do the rest of the living things that are destroyed every day."
doae2mg,Emperor_Aurelian,I have no idea what this rant is about. Because I eat corn I should be pro abortion? That corn isn't going to be a full person.
dobc12t,PaperCutRugBurn,Oh geez.
doa67ga,untakenu,"And killing a living thing just because it isn't convenient to you is not controlling and gross? It is disgusting, if you ask me"
doa7jbc,PaperCutRugBurn,"'isn't convenient' is a really fast and loose way of putting it. You're talking about a definition of 'living' that is not yours to define. You're also talking about someone giving up their one life they get on earth and calling it a 'inconvenient'. Just, so incredibly not your place."
doa3mbl,DAM5150,Don't want one? Don't Have one.
doa3ye8,,"Bill Clinton was right. It should be safe, legal and rare."
doae3sh,Heathen2176,"I've read so many comments about how a baby should be born at all costs. But does anyone think about what happens to the babies after they're born? How many innocent children are born into poverty, neglect or abuse? How many babies are born with disabilities due to being addicted to drugs or because the mother drank heavily while pregnant? You say adoption is an option but there are thousands of kids waiting to be adopted and just live their lives growing up in ""the system"". Where are all the pro-lifers when it comes to taking care of those kids? So instead of taking care of kids who are already in shitty situations, you want more kids put in shitty situations? You say don't have sex if you don't want to get pregnant but pregnancy should not be a punishment for having sex. Sex is human nature and sometimes pregnancy can happen regardless of how safe you are. I think if a mother recognizes that she is unable to provide her baby with a proper life and decides to have an abortion, it's a responsible decision as long as she does it early on. For most women, it is not a light decision and can affect them heavily. Late-term abortion is shitty though, and should not be allowed except in extreme situations. And it should by no means be used as a method of birth control."
doa16g6,ZombieBisque,"Don't give a shit; her body, her choice."
doa4j06,Emperor_Aurelian,But its not her body that is being aborted. Its the fetus
doa4t4d,ZombieBisque,You know exactly what I meant.

doa14ti,dominicanasshit,"I'm liberal so I'm obviously pro choice, but I really wish my college girlfriend hadn't got an abortion."
doa17l8,Sarugan,Was it due to being to young? Mind if you open up to me?
doa1gy4,dominicanasshit,"She just wasn't ready to have a kid. Obviously I respect that, but I still think about what should have happened."
doa1j6v,Sarugan,"Damn, sorry for what happened. Hope you are doing well for yourself!"
doa2i3w,THcB,Quit while you're a head.
doa3uip,redditingatwork31,"My opinion is that my opinion is irrelevant. It isn't my body, so I don't get a say in what a woman can or cannot do with hers. Abortions should be legal and safe.The concept of bodily autonomy is already enshrined in our law in other places: you can't be forced to donate blood or organs, you get to choose what goes into your body. Why should that choice and autonomy stop at the uterus?"
doa8a6a,LovesMeSomeRedhead,"It's a terrible form of birth control, but no woman should be forced to have a baby she doesn't want or can't afford to have. Legal and safe abortions are needed. If you don't have a uterus, you should be able to have an opinion on this but not a vote. No one is forcing us men to carry a child to term."
doa1yoy,peezle69,"Pro-choice.Making it illegal will only result in more dead women. But most importantly, it won't make it go away."
doa4kkt,Emperor_Aurelian,But less dead babies. And those who chose to go through it. The babies did not
doa4wjo,peezle69,Women are still gonna get abortions. Just very unsafe ones.
doa5cqk,Emperor_Aurelian,There all unsafe to the fetus
doa5fur,peezle69,A better way to reduce abortions is sex education and better access to birth control.
doa5i22,Emperor_Aurelian,Yeah. And making it illegal
doa5sao,peezle69,"Again, that's just to make them choose more unsafe alternatives. It should be their choice whether or not to carry the baby."
doa5xkp,Emperor_Aurelian,Its not making choose to get illegal abortions. Its not thier choice to abandon their child after it is born so why before?
doa60c3,untakenu,"Data supporting this? I would think that if abortions weren't legal, people would be either more careful when fucking or just have the baby"
doa67a6,peezle69,https://www.guttmacher.org/sites/default/files/report_pdf/AddingItUp2009.pdf
dofdafb,qi1,Where is there specifically info backing up the idea a significant number of women will attempt dangerous abortions? There are 44 pages I don't have the time to read through.
doa5dos,FetchingTheSwagni,"More dead women, means still a steady flow of dead babies. If a woman gets pregnant, and can't get an abortion, so she kills herself, then the baby is dead as well. If women choose to go through and find an unsafe method, chances are an increase in dead women will increase, too. So in reality, making it illegal will have a small shift in the amount of dead babies, and a greater shift in amount of dead women."
doa1sbo,Verocity8,"In cases of rape, incest or mother's life its acceptable, any other reason wear a condom or get the pill."
doa3c2l,Ms-Anthrop,"condoms break, b/c isn't 100 percent effective. Saddling a woman with a baby she doesn't want or fears is not a good outcome for a new life (that should be wanted) and there are thousands of children already waiting adoption and in foster care already that will never get adopted."
doa3k55,reluctantclinton,Serious question: Isn't there a huge market for adoptions? Wouldn't most of these babies find a loving home anyway?
doa3vlt,Ms-Anthrop,"Babies are not the only children waiting for adoption. Many american couples go through adoptions with other countries as the system in the USA is harder, more expensive d longer and leaves too many older children in foster care (which isn't always good either) never getting a home."
doad5kf,VicePrincipalNero,"I'm a mother through adoption and am a huge supporter of adoption. Adoption is not a cure for abortion or for infertility. No woman should be forced to continue a pregnancy and give birth so that another person can raise a child. Adoption is a very complicated relationship for the child, the birth mother and the adoptive parents. It's not like the birth mother typically just hands over the baby and everyone lives happily ever after. It can be a good outcome, but it's just not that simple."
doa6yui,Verocity8,That is the risk of having sexual reproduction. You might just reproduce. You have to weigh that consequence when engaging in sex. Together condoms and the pill are something like 99% effective so the likelihood of both failing less than or equal to 1%. A soul should not have to die because two people were irresponsible.
doa8916,Ms-Anthrop,Well then wouldn't it be nice if doctors allowed women who don't want kids to have their ovaries removed (tubal ligation) Because many women request this and are refused. I asked multiple times in my 20s and no doctor would do it. I'm not alone in this either.
doa8unb,Verocity8,Was there a reason given? Was the operation too risky or did insurance not cover it? I'm sure can find a doctor that will do it. My point is that when you have sex both parties have to accept that pregnancy and parenthood might be a result.
doa99fc,Ms-Anthrop,"Yes, I was told I would change my mind. I'm 46 now still never want kids and that means either I'm doomed to celibacy forever or if birth control fails and abortion wasn't legally available I'd either have to do it illegally or just suicide. Having a pregnancy or a baby is actually worse to me then the other two options."
doa9mep,Verocity8,"Suicide is a better option? That seems a bit extreme. Still together the pill and condom together are 99%+ effective, and there are even better forms of female birth control out there."
doa14w8,SmilingTroublemaker7,"It's difficult... i see it as a choice between who would get it's life destroyed, the unborn child or the mother with an unwanted pregnancy??"
doa198y,Sarugan,"This is what confuses me on what I should be. On one part it's preventing a life, on the other, it's harmful to the woman. So I'm so tied up. What do you think?"
doa1lvw,SmilingTroublemaker7,"In my opinion, and only mine, life must be protected at all cost...The child should be born without exception, if it endangers the mother life, then the mother should be saved.Rape victims should be treated differently tough, no woman should be forced to bear the child of a rape victim, i know the child bears no sin, but the woman would be psychologically destroyed, not only being a victim of rape (wich is bad enough) but having to be forced to raise the child of the consequence.this is only my opinion, if i have offended someone i'm really sorry."
doa1nwy,Sarugan,"I completely agree, this is such a controversial topic, I have no idea in what I should believe in, but I agree with you."
doa2mky,Nintendroid,">In my opinion, and only mine, life must be protected at all cost...I have typed and retyped a rant about how vague this sounds. Where is the line that defines what life must be protected at the cost of others?"
doa43bn,SmilingTroublemaker7,"Never said at the cost of others, giving a normal birth doesn't kill anyone, care to be more explicit about ""cost of others""?"
doa6lce,Nintendroid,"The taking care of a child can completely derail and diminish the quality of life of an unprepared set of parents, or harsher still, a single parent. If the progress they were going to be able to make has been quashed, that just means that one life got to be made, but in far worse conditions, and it costs the parent(s) their lives, or the next 20 some odd years of it. Another way to look at it is that if one parent or set of parents were on track to be in a successful position to be having four children ten to fifteen years from now, if that one child is born, when they are not yet in a place to be able to support one child, then it is highly likely that the other three will never be born, since they are so much less likely to get to a level to support that many children and themselves."
doa72vw,SmilingTroublemaker7,"That's fine and dandy, but it's enough reason to murder an unborn children?I was born from unprepared parents, they were poor as rats and you could say that from your point of view that I destroyed their life, then a year later my brother was born, then my sister some years after, then my last brother at last. yet I'm here, educated and with a decent job, we where very happy even if we had to work our assess for it.They never had considered abortion as solution."
doaf9q3,Nintendroid,"I disagree. Were the child to be conscious, or sentient at that point, it might be a great deal more like murder. But this is a stage before it has many traits that put it at more of a rodent/insect like state, something we remove out of human convenience all of the time. At the stage where abortion is still legal, it is merely prevention of the development, and removal. To keep the burden off of someone who can't (financially, socially, what have you) handle it, is mercy to the people who would have to deal with the ramifications of a child having been born, no?"
doafgsi,SmilingTroublemaker7,"Great, comparing the human fetus with an insect or a rodent... This conversation is over."
doadd9q,VicePrincipalNero,"WHAT? That's ridiculous. Of course giving birth kills women. Out of ever 100,000 births, about 24 women die in the US, and a much higher number experience serious complications."
doadfbf,SmilingTroublemaker7,"""normal birth""... please read all before ranting"
doae1fo,VicePrincipalNero,"So that's saying that women who don't die don't die, and we're not going to count the ones that do."
doafax7,SmilingTroublemaker7,"I don't even know what are you trying to say, we are talking about abortions!You know what? It's ok... Talking to you it's like having a period, you won."
doag4so,VicePrincipalNero,"Your point seems to be that women should be forced to give birth unless there is a clear cut case where either the woman or the fetus will die, and in that situation it is acceptable to you that the doctor saves the woman. But that's not the reality. Sometimes the women die (in situations were there is no predicted difficulty), and it's not a choice of saving one or the other. Birth kills women. It has serious complications for women in even more cases. It is not risk-free by any stretch of the imagination."
dob3of1,SmilingTroublemaker7,"Ok, let's take a deep breath, and READ again OP question...Did you read it again? great! let's continue:we are NOT talking the risks of birth, we are talking about abortions, ok? to answer OP question: i'm STRONGLY against abortion, life must be preserved. got it?i'm still against, but i could accept abortion under 2 cases:-Rape victims: If i were a raped woman, i couldn't bear to have a child of my attacker, i rather kill myself as it will psychologically destroy me.-Pregnancy with risk to the life of the mother: A fetus can't live without a mother, so mother must be saved or we will lost both.Now that we are crystal clear, what's your opinion about abortions??"
doa37al,dezolis84,"Can't you be both? I feel like you fall right where I do on the issue. If they wanna kill their own unborn child, who are we to say no? Especially if it's dangerous for them to have the child. The issue is just too gray for either extreme to make sense. So yeah, a life is being lost. But it should be their choice."
doa2izx,michaelscottspenis,"What women choose to do with their bodies is their own business, no one elses. Women will seek them out regardless of legality. Better they have access to safe methods."
doa16p7,Noahthered12,"If you want to have it done, have it done, its a fetus, yeah its still a human being, but after all, you made it, you decide what to do with it."
doa3njh,DontTrustMe-,If you follow this logic than you're completely fine with infanticide.
doa4xfy,FoctopusFire,"I'm pro choice, but that's because I think a fetus is pretty much a piece of meat up to a point. I'm actually exactly the opposite of your logic once it develops into a baby. You made it, you are 100% responsible for making sure it has a happy healthy life with as much freedom as is reasonable. That's gonna be a person someday and you can't just do whatever with people. They aren't property."

doa3i8h,PimpNinjaMan,"Personally, I am reluctantly in favor of abortion. I am 100% in favor of abortions in the case of rape or incest. I'm also in favor of voluntary abortions for any reason if they occur very early in the pregnancy. I don't think life (or personhood) begins with a fertilized egg, but I also can't really pinpoint when it does begin. I think we need a much better system of contraceptives and comprehensive sex ed (specifically acknowledging that people will make different choices when they are horny versus when they aren't. Dan Ariely has an amazing point about this in *Predictably Irrational*). Unfortunately, unless a woman who is raped happens to already be on some form of contraceptive, there's still a possibility that she could get pregnant. I don't support but fully understand the pro-life argument. Gradual change is a complicated thing to fathom, so there is a definite logic to believing that life begins at conception. If life begins at conception, then anything done to terminate that life is murder. Pro-lifers are one of the few groups that don't upset me when they go around with their giant posters of aborted fetuses or picketting clinics. It's incredibly hard for the women that have to get abortions, but these people legitimately and genuinely believe those doctors are performing **actual murder** on a regular basis. The main issue I find is when pro-life people support abortions in the case of rape or incest. I understand it because it's a complicated scenario, but they are effectively saying you have the right to murder an innocent child if the father of that child raped you. It's relatively inconsistent with the notion that abortion is murder."
doa46f1,grammaspain,"My personal opinion is that Since we have the technology now and know it's safe to preform the abortion, we must now focus on education. We have to try and teach that it is actually a human being in the making, and I think we have to make people understand the moral and ethical complications that brings. I live in a country where it's not a big deal at all to get an abortion, and I suppose that's good in many ways, but I really dislike the diregard of life some people exhibit when talking about the subject."

doh4w4q,angpuppy,"A direct abortion against a living human being? I'm against it. I don't believe directly taking the life of a living human being can be morally justified. I do believe the law needs to give room for the life and health of the mother because there are situations where saving both isn't possible. If the option to save both is present, it ought to be taken.In terms of the law, I think any law or policy that treats the killing of innocent life as a human right is a gross injustice and violates the most basic principles of human rights.With that said, I don't care for the fact that the Republicans have so much influence over the pro life community and fight an abortion simply at a level of reducing access while cutting off and limiting funds to programs that help pregnant women and new mothers or just the poor in general. Granted some of my concerns could be resolved if we had a single payer health care system rather than a system that requires pregnant women to jump through hoops to qualify for programs that they may not even be aware of. Moreover, while no one can deny that the pill played a huge role in the sexual revolution and sexual risk taking, I don't think abstinence education and trying to prevent kids from having access to contraceptives decreases the sexual risk taking or undoes the sexual revolution. I get that some pro lifers feel that the sexual revolution fuels abortion and thus must be undone to stop abortion, but I think that's a simplistic view of cultural changes. If there were a pro life Democrat who was sincerely pro life and promised to fund actual research into creative the most effective policies to reduce, prevent, and end the perceived need of abortion (promising regular reports over how effectively they're shrinking those numbers to show that their strategy is indeed working), then they'd be more likely to have my vote. But the party actively rejects pro life democrats. They're very pro abortion and I can't stand it.My frustration with both parties has led me to become a member of the American Solidarity Party, though I'm also a supporter of Democrats for Life."
dpsec69,Michael-harambay,"People who call it the ""pro choice"" movement are purposely deflecting the argument. It's not about choice, everyone already agrees that anyone (regardless of gender) can do with their body as they wish. Same with calling it a fetus repeatedly, even when it's like in the third trimester. Taking to these people, they make sure to call it a fetus or an embryo or anything but a ""baby"", because then that would humanize the ""clump of cells"" and they can't have that.The argument is whether or not an unborn child has rights, when that person growing in your womb obtains those rights (when are they recognized as a human beings), and what those rights should be.Personally I think the only line you can draw is at conception. Scientifically speaking, once the egg fertilizes via a sperm, a zygote is formed. Zygotes contain distinct DNA compared to either of the parents, meaning it's DNA is NOT that of the mother's body's cells and thus it is not a part of her body. It is more than a clump of cells - technically all living things are a ""clump of cells"", yet pro choice people often cite this as a moral reason that the mother can do what she wants to it. People arguing to euthanize dogs don't call the animals a ""clump of cells"".It is in her body, yes, there's that. But that is inherently the nature of a developing fetus. Left to its natural devices (that is, existence), a fetus/baby will be born, become an infant, then a child, adult, etc. we all started out this way. Again, scientifically speaking, the zygote is undeniably human, with 46 chromosomes. That is by definition human. Why is a zygote more important than a skin cell, then, since they're both human? Skin cells (or any other somatic cells on a adult) don't turn into a developing human being. So zygotes are unique in this aspect.And where do you draw the line? Honestly? I want to know why other people think at what time it's okay to abort the developing fetus up to. The third week? The third trimester?Until the heart starts beating? There are adults with pacemakers. Until the brain stays functioning? What about autistic people or those in a coma? Until limbs start developing? There are disabled people born without limbs, or missing hair, or blind, or who can't breath without a ventilator. Should they be considered less than human?Personal argument time:I personally think the argument that you're not ready is (minus cases of rape) invalid. Did you have sex? Yes. Were you aware that sex is the one thing that creates other human beings? I should hope so. Poor planning on your part should not constitute an emergency (murder) on the baby's part, who had no say in being made in the first place. Either have the standards to know who you're fucking well enough to have a plan B (be it adoption or what have you) or wait until you ARE ready. Because the pill/condemns etc CAN fail. There's a low probability with protection, but the chance is there and it is real. That is why abstinence only education used to be prevalent - regardless of the religious context, it is the one 100% way for knowing you're not going to have an accidental pregnancy that you can't afford right now or that mommy will kill you over, etc. Pregnancy, and children, are a factor in sex. That's a fact. As fun as sex is, it can have consequences (or you can see it as a reward, for those trying to have children). You were ready the moment you consented. If you really don't want the baby when you find out, give it up for adoption. Nine months of being pregnant (which is not the horrifying blood and guts traumatic PTSD inducing experience pro choice people make it out to be, just ask your mother) is a fair trade for not murdering someone who never meant to cause you any ill will in the first place. You put that baby in your womb, not your friends, not your parents, not your peers. YOU did. I wish people would stop being so irresponsible and then to add insult to injury, put murder on top of that. Actions have consequences, so be prepared or keep it in your pants."

Forcing the mother to carry to term to put the baby up for adoption could be too much a mental and physical burden. And would be a daily reminder for 9 months that could prevent any healing.As a form of birth control, no. I get that shit happens. The guy might be using a condom and the woman on birth control but there's a reason for the 99% effective disclaimer. And that's a risk that anyone who has sex needs to accept.A good while back I read an article about a man (I think in Florida) who killed a pregnant woman. He was being charged with the murder of two people. The woman and the unborn baby. It's a bit of a double standard for a government to consider taking an unborn life murder in one case but a ""standard procedure"" when done in a clinic."

It's a bad thing that people will always do, but it shouldn't be entertained, it should be circumvented, long before people reach this point.

But for somebody who choose to have sex understanding they could easily get pregnant, and then turn around and say they don't want a child. That's where the problem lies. Responsibility, unfortunately many people lack it. Another problem (as you stated) is that if we do ban them people will continue to do illegal and dangerous ones. Unfortunately I see no way to stop people from doing such things. I wish we could ban abortion and people would have responsible sex and use birth control. Basically I don't know how to solve the problem. I'll leave that to the politicians. All I have is an opinion."
