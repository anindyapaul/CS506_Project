You'd think the world is *literally ending.* I kind of love it, but it makes me sad that so many believed her propaganda, and a little frustrated about some of the bs they spew about President Elect Trump."
d9spze4,Ser_Duncan_the_Tall,Same. It's glorious. All the liberal generalists who think they know and understand all are weeping and gnashing their teeth. MAGA
d9sotb9,rumpledstiltskins,"She'll talk to them from prison, the low life cunt.Congratulations fellow centipedes.

You guys are an amazingly motivating force.Offering up a salute to our commanders army."
d9sv0cz,IanPR,o7
d9skfm5,throwaway-aa2,"VERY LOW CLASS. They waited for her and she wouldn't even show up and let them see her... even just talking to them would have calmed them down. What was that like? She probably made the trip for all of them back home very dangerous, not calming them down, telling them that it would be ok and to keep up the fight.I hate to say it but women are not built for that kind of stuff, caring for the pack sort of actions (unless someone goes out of their way to build it into them). Be pro first women president all you want, but you can't defend the fact that she did this and you can try to take moral high ground but she did it and SHE made a strong argument against a first woman president."
d9spbw7,MrBojangles528,I don't think her behavior is any indictment against women as a whole. She is a corrupt and sociopathic bird of singular feather.
d9snomu,Frontfart,Her supporters don't mind. They know they are the grease in the cogs and nothing more.
d9soun8,Methodmapper,What character.... She is what she is. Thank God for Trump!
dcmig6f,147DegreesWest,You would think she would come out and thank her people

d9spenj,MrBojangles528,"I totally called it. Everything she has done in her life has shown that she has no character, and is possibly the least gracious person in the world. She cannot admit fault to a pathological degree, and felt completely entitled to the presidency. Not to mention she was probably shitfaced by 6pm EST."
d9siwkr,bejeavis,She couldn't even tell the truth about having a concession speech ready. Then she phoned it in to Trump like a sniveling little weasel. It's shit like this Hillary.

dcj79ii,strongbadiophage,"Did he mean ""phone it in"" figuratively? I don't know exactly what he's referring to, though."
d9sv7ju,Jitzkrieg,She had Huma do it. The call was from Huma to Conway.

d9ssief,sharklops,"As she walks away from her election HQ her shuffling gait gradually transforms into a strong and purposeful walk.

d9skc1g,throwaway-aa2,"no, because she's a broad and can take no responsibility. This is who you voted for people... she gave no gracious concession."

d9sqbl8,stationhollow,Podesta came out and said that nothing would happen tonight. That there was still plenty to do tomorrow before it was over and they should all go home. 20 minutes later she had conceded to trump on the phone.
d9skzu4,theycallmeryan,I was scared she wouldn't concede. Hillary shouldn't have sent Podesta out there.

d9sqh29,TEH_PROOFREADA,"The on-screen banner graphic read ""CLINTON CALLS TRUMP TO CONCEDE ELECTION"", which could be mis-interpreted to mean ""Clinton asks Trump to concede"", but it really meant ""Clinton phoned Trump, begging him not to send an old grandma to prison for treason"".

d9skf1e,RaiderDamus,"I am a Christian, but I am extremely skeptical of any and all so-called ""pray away the gay"" programs because I've never seen any evidence that they work, and frankly I'm not sure that they should. From what I've read, they do far more harm than good and are extremely predatory in nature.Mike Pence isn't a boogeyman, though. His policies in that arena won't pass muster with Trump. People are scared about Donald Trump, a man who held up a rainbow-colored flag at a rally in front of tens of thousands of people, a man who thoroughly condemned the Pulse massacre, a man who talked about defending gay rights at the fucking Republican National Convention and got massive cheers for it. That's NEVER happened before.Leadership comes from the top, but it is also dependent on feedback from the bottom. We've long moved past demonizing people based on their sexual orientation. If that happens from now on, it's on an individual basis rather than coming from the conservative party. Trump is literally the most pro-LGBTQ candidate who has ever run on a Repub ticket, and maybe the only one."
d9sp31f,DrobUWP,"pence is Trump throwing a bone to conservative Republicans. just ask yourself how influential Biden has been on policy over the past 8 years. Trump is inclusive. it's not the identity politics of the left. are you here legally? then Trump is in your camp. it's Nationalism in a good way. people often think of Nationalism as a bad thing. it's associated it with racism because everyone gets pointed to Germany and a nation of just one race against others. America is a melting pot though. Black, Latino, Asian, White, LGBTQ, Straight, etc. etc. etc. and we are all working together to better the lives of Americans."
d9sk1wm,Unsully,From someone with gay roommates who are freaking out right now and showed me an article about Pence basically confirming that the transgendered bathroom issue was going to be one of their focuses. Are you so sure the LGBTQ community isn't going to be affected?
d9snm9u,CLE_BROWNS_32,"I wouldn't worry so much. Pence represents no legislative power as vice, only advisory (mostly). Trump also stated Caitlyn Jenner could use whichever bathroom she preferred in Trump Tower."

We will not stand for this rigged system and lobbyists and those trade deals/TPP meant to stifle and give the power to corporations. If you think the victory is unbelievable in any way, you haven't realized how strongly the adversity had to be fought over. The swamp will be drained, and the power given back to the people.If you think you lost big because everyone told you Hillary was going to win, and you feel impossibly deceived and appalled, you are just barely beginning to see a glimpse of how it feels following Wikileaks and seeing rampant corruption, rampant pedophilia by the elites, coverup by the very branches of the government meant to serve you, but instead servicing themselves, and feeling hopeless just reading how badly the entire machine is.

daes4c9,,"Out of curiosity, what's wrong with globalization?"
dafyqkr,Michmatch,"There are a few parts to the answer: 1. Globalism weakens the nation state. By using millions of tax revenue to aid in global pursuits, it is not the best way to use that money, and it could be better used within the home nation to strengthen it. 2. It puts way too much power into the hands of such a small group of individuals. If people were to have power over many nations, corruption would be damn near unstoppable. At the end of the day, not only does it weaken the country, but the major thing is it is a creator of corruption. When the government has more power, it is proven to get abused time and time again. Laws being pushed not representing the people, decisions made benefiting big corporations rather than the citizens, etc. There's more evidence of globalism's shortcomings, but these were the major issues I could think of tonight."

d9skby3,MiamiPower,"Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business, complicated. Thank you very much.I've just received a call from secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us. On our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign.I mean she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.I mean that very sincerely. Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together, to all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.It is time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all of Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family.It is a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs, who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will.Working together we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business, looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It is going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans who have been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey.The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors.Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It is going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We will be. We will have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country, and beautiful things and successful things once again.I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone.All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I would like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight a very, very historic victory.First I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I are truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth who are here with us tonight. Where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy actually.And my brother Robert, my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert?My brother Robert, and they should be on this stage but that's okay. They're great.And also my late brother Fred, great guy. Fantastic guy. Fantastic family. I was very lucky.Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. To Melania and Don and Ivanka and Eric and Tiffany and Barron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough.This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it is tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group.You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all of the people that we have. Look at all of these people.And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here, and I want to tell you it's been very, very special.I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. He's unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings, and Rudy never changes. Where is Rudy. Where is he?[Chanting ""Rudy""]Gov. Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician ‚Äî let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he is as smart as you get, senator Jeff sessions. Where is Jeff? A great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? Is that Rudy?Up here. Really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats, Dr. Ben Carson. Where's been? Where is Ben? By the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his familiar bring Sarah, thank you very much. Gen. Mike Flynn. Where is Mike? And Gen. Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign and there are special people. We have 22 congressional medal of honor people. A very special person who, believe me, I read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is -- that's right, how did you possibly guess? Let me tell you about Reince. I've said Reince. I know it. I know it. Look at all of those people over there. I know it, Reince is a superstar. I said, they can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win it. Like secretariat. He would not have that bust at the track at Belmont.Reince is really a star and he is the hardest working guy and in a certain way I did this. Reince, come up here. Get over here, Reince.Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. It's about time you did this right. My god. Nah, come here. Say something.[Reince Priebus: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the united States, Donald Trump! Thank you. It's been an honor. God bless. Thank God.]Amazing guy. Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we've done, so I also have to say, I've gotten to know some incredible people.The Secret Service people. They're tough and they're smart and they're sharp and I don't want to mess around with them, I can tell ya. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down in the seat, but they are fantastic people so I want to thank the Secret Service.And law enforcement in New York City, they're here tonight. These are spectacular people, sometimes under appreciated unfortunately, we we appreciate them. So it's been what they call an historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job and I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job. I look very much forward to being your president and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years or maybe even eight years you will say so many of you worked so hard for us, with you you will say that ‚Äî you will say that that was something that you were ‚Äî really were very proud to do and I can ‚Äî thank you very much.And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. We're going to get to work immediately for the American people and we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president. You will be so proud. Again, it's my honor.It's an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period and I love this country. Thank you.Thank you very much. Thank you to Mike Pence."

You're marginalizing and making fun of people with disabilities.Ignoring the fact that you're being rude and just cursing - you never really responded to the fact that Trump's policies will make this country worse off.

d9skdhk,gophergun,"Berner here. We had a large number of disagreements (with both candidates), but the way I see it, Trump was in some ways the Bernie of the right - a populist, insurgent candidate against party incumbents. The difference is, he was able to win big league. Trump won tonight because he not only got people to vote for him, but made people actively excited for the future. He had a coherent platform and vision for the country that resonated with voters. On top of that, he was open and communicative, even off-the-cuff via his Twitter feed, and that contrasts sharply with Clinton's closely guarded persona. I guess what I'm trying to say is that even though I may have agreed with Clinton more on policy (though not enough to vote for her), Trump was the better candidate. Congratulations, you've earned it. (and the DNC have earned this, too.)"

Is this the fall of Rome or the next Renaissance? Only time will tell. Trump has been gifted with a Republican House and Senate (despite internal party opposition). I'd like to mark this moment with a stake in the sand and come back in 4 years to review: Has Trump...* built ""the wall and made Mexico pay for it""?* ~~repealed~~ [renegotiated NAFTA](http://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.3244280) * rejected the TPP* repealed Obamacare and replaced it with something ""so much better""* defeated ISIS* ~~overturned Citizens United (I don't believe Trump has ever actually promised this, but there have been insinuations).~~ this appears to be incorrect, simply wishful thinking...

d9splbp,OG-Slacker,"Right man. Not just sexist. Racist.... My first Sanders rally / march was in Baltimore. The march was planned by some Sanders for Maryland group. Their brilliant idea was to march though the some poor neighborhoods and stop traffic. Not the worst idea in the world. However it somehow became a BLM march, because all people were yell at every black person they could find was ""Black Lives Matter"". I started thinking aren't we here for Sanders? Don't All lives matter? This is divisive... even if you agree lets stay focused. Get our canidate out there. Let them know there is more to Sanders.I started chanting All Lives Matter and to their shock most of the people in the neighborhoods started cheering the same. Even some of the cops that were escorting us. Out of now were this SJW gets in my face and started screaming about white privilege and how I don't get it and I'm racist. I was like bruh... let me explain who I am and where I'm from.Next thing I knew my inner Baltimore came out and I BTFO this guy.The chants started up a couple again a couple of minutes later and I just laughed. That was my first real introduction to the regressive left. Now Hillary supporters are actually on a whole other level racists. They are the ones that drew up the SJW sables in the first place. Because they divide up people by votes. They don't see people, they see numbers just like the corp fucks they are. After they started calling Sanders sexist. I was officially done. Whats really sad is many of these people won't learn from any of this. They still think they are right. Hell look how the media establishment is already making excuses for them. Making shit worse by saying its a divided country. Well you fucks are the ones dividing us. All I care about people is if they are good people. If you aren't I want nothing to do with you. The moral in the end should be cheaters never win. But I bet even that somehow they'll still project at everyone else. This fucks are actively celebrating that the stock market is taking a hit. That's how sick they are."
d9sqanc,randomguy571,"Totally agree, sick of seeing people sit on their high horses in California and such states that have lost no jobs have low crime and all, look down on everyone from their moral high ground. Just because they feel 'first female president' is on their agenda everyone should either join or be called a sexist bigots regardless of their circumstances and views... I'm so sad in seeing how much SJWs can increasingly divide people by labeling people as sexist, bigots etc. I hope the left and right can someday argue peacefully on ideas without dividing nations up."
d9spuia,UnavailableUsername_,"1. Almost all the media was against him.* Almost all the polls (except the one that predicted brexit) said he would lose.* He was attacked multiple times during his rallies by ""tolerant leftist"".* He was given 99% chance of NOT getting the nomination by CNN.* Hours before he was given 10% chance of winning the election, or less. #And he won.Man, that was quite interesting to see."

The defeat of Hillary Clinton and her subsequent retirement is the saving grace of this nation. I don't have to worry about my firearms being taken away. I don't have to worry about WW3 with Russia. I don't have to worry about having a corrupt scandal-ridden President being in office. I can finally...relax. No more anxiety or fear of a bad outcome. I don't have to worry about the stupid FBI investigation and Clinton being let off... because she's not going to be in the white house.(Although I bet money Obama will pardon her now.)God it feels good.

d9sl8p8,pornaddict69,"I've been depressed for many years... hated my job, hated college, (took me eight years to get an engineering degree), hated the direction the country was going in (SJWs, identity politics, etc; I'd lost hope). This election required voters to think critically; we had two very distinct choices for the first time in 40 years... and we won. My hope has been restored, my confidence in the country somewhat, and my personal confidence as someone who predicted he'd win in 2015 has been majorly, to the derision of my own family, who are mostly republican, totally restored. I'm contemplating taking another sick day. Many things went well for me today; I took it off mostly because I'm sooo bored at work, and always tired (I use little vacation or sick time); and because it was Election Day. I wanted my happiness of not working karma to flow to trump. Not only did I fix a broken tool, I fixed a broken truck that sat idle in my yard for four months, and the COUNTRY WENT MAGA! I've always wanted to run my own business: today has me feeling the confidence to do so! I've been right now, more than I've been wrong. My family thought me crazy when I said Trump would win (way back in 2015 when he announced). Trump, however pitiful this sounds, has made me believe in myself again. I feel, under his presidency, my only hinderance to success is me. I can accept that. I cannot accept an oppressive government doctrine and be happy."

d9sirzd,muddyalcapones,"Dear Trump folk, I am a Hilary voter, but I came here to see how you were handling the victory. Obviously I am disappointed that my candidate lost, but above all else I am an American and want our country to survive and thrive. As you enjoy your victory please remember to be kind to folks on the other side! We all need to work together now and come together behind president trump to try and help all Americans out! If your victory turns into a condemnation of your fallen foes then you'll end up no better that the business as usual Washington insiders you so strongly dislike. The voting is over and now we must all heal. This was an especially contentious election but hopefully we can all work to find some middle ground! Thank you for listening."

There may be a few days of weirdness as the country wakes up to what just happened, but I want everyone on your side ot know I bear absolutely no ill-will to you and the first priority is the well being of my fellow Americans. That counts everyone, including those who disagree with me."

d9sjf23,cubs223425,"Mark Cuban backtracking on leaving the country. I'm sure most, if not all, of the others will do the same from the list of cucks. It's hilarious how Trump is out there complimenting Clinton and talking of wanting to help those who supported him and didn't. He talks of working for everyone, not just Republicans, and his crowd cheered wildly. Meanwhile, Clinton's people are on Twitter saying they fear for their safety and people like Cher do nothing to show any shred of respect or willingness to accept the idea that the other side would help them.Remember who the bigots are. We are willing to accept the losing side as crucial to moving forward as a unit. They want to spit bile and call names and react angrily. Why are we the side of hate? Why are we the bigots?"

When all this is really proof of is how much all the insults have no meaning any more, how tired people are of trying to come to terms and appease people who are never satisfied.But on the bright side, a Trump presidency represents a lot of opportunity. How will someone from outside the establishment perform? How will the world see the past few decades of our history when they can't insult us from behind our protection?Is there corruption for him to dismantle, and can he do it?Have we been caring way too much about politeness?Will Trump effectively legalize marijuana by leaving it to the states?Will reddit stop being a platform of mass manipulation?We've already learned that the system isn't so broken that establishment candidates can rig it entirely."

Trump never wanted to divide the country even when Democrats and other Republicans wanted to. Give this man a chance like so many of you asked Republicans to give Obama a chance.

ddcc5im,theNotoriousJEU,"I feel like commenting just to be a part of this thread. I think it's incredible that in 50 years from now people will be able to see the chatter of regular people at particular points in time; that's something never done before in human history. As a WWII 'enthusiast' I wish I could read what ordinary Germans & British people were saying in the 1940's and I guess this thread is a bit like that.I sat up to watch the election at around 4am GMT. I am in Ireland so it wasn't my election but American elections are like world elections. I had booked the next day off work so I could stay up so late. I fell asleep and awoke at 4 or 5am to see Trump winning and I honestly stared at the TV for about 5 minutes in shock.I wanted him to win. Not because I was overly enthusiastic about his policies, but because he seemed like the only hope of ever reforming the corrupt American political system. The world follows America and I think that if Trump had lost it would have been the end of alternative candidates - ""why vote for X? They'll never win"". I don't think he was the right man for the job but given the choice of him vs. the status quo, I would go for him. Sadly it doesn't seem to have caused the political earthquake I was hoping for.Maybe someone in the future will read this long after it has played out and think something entirely different. Who knows, but I am glad he won.So there's my place in this historic thread, written @ 01:13am on 05-Feb-17."

d9y9krk,Physics_Hunter,"I am quite new here. The 'pede and crappost (forgive me, I try not to swear too much...) encoding is unfamiliar to me.That said, your question is a good one. In 1980, we wondered if the average man (speaking in 80's parlance) could possibly vote again for Carter wearing a crochet vest telling us that we should turn our thermostats down, accepting crazy interest rates and record unemployment.Ronnie was a bit of a risk. He looked to be a converted lib, turned rock ribbed conservative, but he had paid his dues in 1976.In Trump, I am pretty sure that we, and yes I voted for him, elected an old school American that is probably center-left.More apropos: how do I feel?In one fell swoop, the Alinsky-ites and their legacy might have been kicked to the curb.Trump has an opportunity to be like Washington, or the Clintons.

dd4fn6j,Fancy-Bear1776,"This was my very first election that I was old enough to vote in. Truth be told, I originally was not going to vote, or if I did it would've been for Bernie. I too, like my friends, joked about Trump and how ludicrous his chances of being president were.When Bernie was no longer a candidate I was heartbroken, contemplating choosing for Gary Johnson as the election drew near, more afraid at the idea of President Trump or President Clinton.However as time passed, I felt different. I couldn't, and still cannot, explain it. However I felt like Trump truly does care for America and truly wants to make it good again.When the election day came, I casted my vote for Trump. When my friends were crying in anguish over Hillary losing, I stood on the sidelines, happier than ever.My friends absolutely hate the man, and even think I might be joking when I tell them I support our president, but it's barely been a week and Trump has already gone through and done so much in such a short time. I've never been so proud as to stand amongst fellow pedes.That said my friends, ***MAGA!***"

I didn't mean to do that to Hillary but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is she losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe Trump can stand on his own two legs. I want to be culturally enriched by refugees. I want Hillary to be president and let in more refugees. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought they were correcting the record???? This is so fucked."

I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is she losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Hillary to be president and fix this broken country.

d9t7sf4,,"I woke up this morning on 4 and a half hours of sleep after a night of following the results, and this still feels like a dream. Donald J. Trump has shocked the world and snatched the oval office from the hands of incompetency and corruption. For the first time in a long, long time, I genuinely have faith and hope in the future of my country.---Before announcing his run to the oval office 15 months ago, Donald Trump was living the life...he was on top of the world as the owner of wildly successful businesses that employed thousands of people, and at one point he was a reality TV star. But he sacrificed all of his wealth, his fame, and his lifestyle for his country. Throughout the election, Mr. Trump and his supporters were belittled by the mainstream media and even Hillary Clinton, who referred to Trump supporters as part of a ""basket of deplorables."" Not that he isn't guilty of similar behavior directed at the other side, but Mr. Trump and his basket of deplorables has done the unthinkable. We have snatched the oval office from the hands of a candidate who has gone through what seems to be a 30-year-long spree of incompetency, scandal, and crime. From the establishment of the failed NAFTA deal and the intimidation/silencing of Mr. Clinton's sexual assault victims to the abandoning of four American heroes at Benghazi and the threatening of our national security by the use of a private server on which classified government information was distributed, we have single-handedly saved our great country from disaster.---Under the presidency of Donald J. Trump, our country will prosper economically. Our country will be much safer and more secure thanks to a strengthened military and police forces. Speaking of police, law enforcement officers everywhere will be treated with the respect that they deserve. Black Lives Matter will be held accountable for their acts of domestic terrorism. Criminals will be treated like criminals, not ""victims"" of ""government oppression"", and held accountable for the crimes they commit. Hillary Clinton will finally be brought to justice for her crimes. Law and order will be restored. Judicial restraint will be applied in the Supreme Court. We will gain the upper hand in the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism. College students will be treated like adults as opposed to being treated like children, meaning that the end of the age of ""Safe Spaces"" and being offended by anything and everything that goes against certain viewpoints is upon us. Under Donald Trump, this country WILL BE GREAT AGAIN.---God Bless you, God bless your family, and God Bless the United States of America."

That alone should have been a scandal large enough to have him removed from office. Obama literally lied to America to try to get a crook elected. The whole fucking media was in on it too. After accusations of hillary being sick, the media tried to dispell those rumors by making [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt22Y9-dfNk). The video has even been proved to be fake, as the pickle jar used was opened in the past to make it easier for her. On September 11 2016 Hillary collapsed, which was caught on camera by someone who wasn't part of the mainstream media. The media tried covering this up with more and more lies, but the video got around despite the media's best effort.There are so many more scandals too, it would take forever for me to list them all."

d9spucx,cursedcassandra,"Wikileaks dump of dnc2 e mails shook them on the last day plus O'Keefe announcing he had a nation wide sting operation to bust doc cheating. He said operatives were everywhere and cheaters would be out and sent to prison. He'd already taken out the top players of dirty tricks and proven he was at lower levels when he exposed union bosses, smug donors at a fund raiser. All of this on the day before the election. Imagine their panic. Who would risk the humiliation and prison time to steal a few votes? Especially when the top guys aren't there to terrorize you into taking one for the team. Trump was very clever to set this up last year to neutralize the doc fraud machine at the very last minute. Plus he'd already made certain people were being hyper vigilant for fear Hillary would steal the election. Finally he'd made it Crystal clear that he would contest the election if he didn't win and there was even the hint of cheating. The doc knows very well that he LOVES taking crooks and cheats to court. They know he has vicious lawyers. They know the GOPe has famously effective lawyers.

d9so7oi,Poliopals,"I am so happy and proud to be part of this, thank you America. Everyone told me I was wrong that Trump would win, people yelled at me got angry with me because I thought he was the better candidate. The people around me, the media, the pundits, the polls etc EVERYTHING said I was wrong. BUT LOOK WHOS LAUGHING NOW I FUCKING LOVE YOU GUYS. MAGA"
d9somvs,DeuceVisional,"What I don't get is why when looking at the county by county map, EVERY major city is heavily democrat. It makes no sense whatsoever. If you look at TX, the major cities (including el paso, fuck them) are HEAVILY democrat. Im shocked we actually won TX in 2016. But Im talking every major city in every State.WTF even memphis TN, Nashville are heavily democrat. WTF"
d9sorpq,SpaceUnicorn2016,We have had an open Southern border for several years. Living in an apartment in the city is cheaper than living in the suburbs. But it does always strike me as odd too. We know it is easiest to commit fraud if there is a higher population.

d9spb8k,Svyashchennik,"Its good for Britain in many aspects. Considering he called himself Mr Brexit. When Brexit was still being voted on, he said if Brexit happens and he becomes President, it will build a strong relationship between the two (he said something in that sort). Nigel Farage (UKIP Leader and major leader in Brexit campaign) was with him during his campaign in Illinois if i am not mistaken. Even Boris Johnson and Theresa May said this will strengthen the US-UK relation."

I'm liberal so it wasn't a natural choice but there's no way I could've ever supported hillary. Bernie didn't have scandals behind him the whole way so it probably would've been a really close race."
d9sysdo,,u support a communist and u call urself anti establishment
d9t040d,low_key_like_thor,"Well for one, he wasn't a communist. There are distinct differences between Democratic Socialism and communism and that misnomer is pretty bad. Second, establishment refers to the current system in place of two parties that make all the decisions largely without considering the wants and needs of lower and middle class Americans. Bernie was anti establishment in that he wanted to abolish the ability of wealthy corporations to influence politics to such a high degree. While Trump is anti establishment for his general attitude of ""fuck you i do what I want."" Either way, having an anti-establishment leader in power should shake things up and hopefully fix the issues we have in our political system."

When she returned I asked her what if she thought they were able to rehab. Her whole demeanor had changed wrt them and she said, yes, I think so. Sounds to me like cali is trying to normalize sex crimes. Keep it up Cali and we may need to wall your state off along with Mexico. Don't worry, we'll put in a big beautiful door that you can use if you do it legally and embrace our culture. Pedophiles are NOT normal and cannot be rehabbed. They belong in prison.

I wanted to sleep through the night and then - for better or worse - get the news with ONE blow.Woke up at 4:30am though and couldn't resist to check /r/the_donald It looked very good at that point if I recall correctly but we didn't win yet. But it was not bad. So I tried to get back to sleep. NO CHANCE. I had fever dreams, half-sleeping half-awake. Till 6:10 when I usually get up.Checked /r/the_donald again. Everyone was already celebrating because I think we were very close at that point. PA was still being counted, but we were in the lead.It STILL took me till about 9am until they FINALLY called PA in and it was finally SURE that Trump had one. I cried in the Stra√üenbahn.

d9sj6bg,nnovember,This is a very underrated comment. I hope you're right.
d9sj531,ea_rubes,"This is unbelievably refreshing; I feel like it's not so much trump but what actually electing trump as president stands for. It shows that we the people are absolutely sick of these cherry picked presidential candidates that are bought with bribes and money to rub their own backs, that all these programs meant to help but in reality have been abused for far too long can finally become more regulated that there can finally be a step for the AMERICAN people rather than focusing on catering to the rest of the world.. one thing we need to understand is we are Americans first..we have to actually start doing things that unites us and helps strengthen us as Americans rather than trying to help the rest before we help ourselves."

Vested interests in the markets that have links to the Clintons will sell sell sell - the markets are plummeting, colour me surprised about that.3. Clinton won't come out of the bunker after re-enacting the scene from 'Downfall'.4. The Clintons will be getting a private jet ready to head to Qatar (unless someone cancels their passports).5. There will be shredders, cleaners going in and all sorts of evidence removal going on by the Podestas and their cronies.6. The FBI and NYPD will be heaving a massive sigh of relief. Now we get to see if Comey was compromised at all.7. Anonymous will finish the job, with help from millions of pedes World wide.What will happen from now will make the Fall of the Roman Empire seem tiny by comparison. As what the pedes on here have found goes right up to the likes of Soros at the very top, this is a real popcorn moment.The Clinton Narrative Network need to call Nelson Muntz and get his comments about their efforts to get Hillary elected - a massive ""HAA- HAAAAAAAA!!"".

I just hope you guys made the right call, and I sincerely mean that because I am not a Trump believer (nor was I a Clinton believer for that matter), and the worst case scenario still exists that a Trump presidency could be a trainwreck. Still, I'm going to hope for the best because that's all I can do now. If he surprised us now, maybe he can do so again as President (in a good way obviously)."

All politicians do a lot of empty talking (and make no mistake, he is a politician, more or less), so he's still a wildcard in many ways. It'll be an interesting show at the very least, that's for sure."

He has a clear path to innact a mandate.But the question becomes will he follow through or do what most do. and no one can say which, here with Brexit so far I don't think anybody has got what they wanted, I say this as someone who supported Bernie still supports Bernie really. Watch Trump with all the vigilance you watched Hillary, your job isn't over, you've got to make sure he actually does what you want, because he is the establishment now.Congratulations guys"
d9smegu,jibjabjrjr,"Thanks friend, for your lovely comment. All my friends supported Bernie, and I understand his appeal. Politically, I've always leaned right, so I'm probably inclined to see his policies as more Caracas than Stockholm, but I do understand how he is a good person who's fighting for the you's and me's.I really hope Mr. Trump will use his mandate to put America first. I hope he'll be a voice for the Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, *Michigan*, and *Maine-2* voters who feel forgotten, and did what no other Republican could. And particularly, I hope he'll welcome our Hispanic and Latino friends with open arms. As a PolSci student who hopes to be elected to office someday, I promise I'll watch Trump with the vigilance that I watched Hillary with. The goal isn't R or D. It's America."

Hope Trump puts an end to lobbying by the big corporates too."

That goal is to work towards an America that benefits all Americans, with the goal of creating a better, more fair government that the rest of the world can choose (or not.

I just couldn't understand why every time I tried to have a proper discussion, I was cast down as racist. If you act like a criminal you get treated like a criminal. I was beginning to think I was wrong, when all I found were anti police retaric and the MSM playing law and order like it was criminal. Then I found this sub and man I was so happy to find people who were willing to have proper discussions. News that showed both sides of the story. Thanks. LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! LAW AND ORDER! PROTECT OUR SECOND AMENDMENT, BECAUSE WITHOUT IT WE WOULD STILL BE BRITISH AND WE KNOW HOW THEY WELL THEY FOUGHT THE GERMANS WITHOUT OUR HELP. MAGA!"

Give them time, and then help explain to them what we saw in Clinton if you must.Third, get involved. I'm going to join the whatever republican group in Arizona I can to start help have my mark on local politics and this new republic party. Trump can't fix the world with a wave of his hair. This election was a coming out party for all those we thought were against us. I thought the sjws outnumbered us - BUT THEY DONT! We are the ground forces. Volunteer, teach, donate your time.

Considering the vitriol anyone saying anything nice about Trump endured why would he lie? Have them check out Jesse Jackson praising Trump for his support of Rainbow Push when it was not popular. Google the picture of Trump, Rosa Parks and Ali standing together as recipients of the Ellis Island Freedom Award. He earned it for his work for inner city kids.

Trump must not reneg on his promise to sue the fake accusers and the NYT. He must not reneg on his promise to fix the GOP.On CNN and Fox, I saw scoundrels trying to suck up to President Trump. Not gonna work. We're going to continue boycott their trash."

Bill Clinton came into my room to bring me a box of cigars and I literally screamed ""BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST INFOWARS.COM"" at him and hit the cigars out of his hand. He started getting undressed and humping me and I slammed the door on him. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to Hillary Clinton's husband but I'm literally in shock from his sexual advances. Why the fucking fuck is he trying to rape me? I know what he did with these cigars in the Oral Office. This can't be happening. Why is Joy Behar calling me a tramp?? I'm having a fucking breakdown! I don't want to believe Hillary supports and defends rapists like her husband. I want to remain a ""nerd virgin."" I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought he was quietly dying of AIDS. This is so fucked.**"

I have tried to tell them about what Hillary is really like and they shut me down immediately. Every time. And then we agree to not talk politics. I've been studying this election for a year and half, every day studying and learning , a fire was lit under my ass.These people do not believe a word I say. They do not read Wikileaks or read up on anything, they just believe what others are telling them: others who thought they were backing a winning horse, which makes it easy for them to not have to do any real digging for info. They believed everything the MSM said to them, and told me to shut up. Well, folks, you get what you pay for. I paid a year and half's worth of attention to this shit. They paid... lip service. They got the candidate they didn't want, oh well. Too bad. Not my problem. I tried to open your eyes. Oh and get this: my best friend just said she didn't see how we could go forward as friends. Because I am glad Hillary lost. That shit is boggling my mind. She (we were lovers at one time) said she is curled up like a baby in fear of her life. I'm astounded by that. She's going to cut me off as a friend. I just don't even."

The markets all over the world are in a tailspin, and you applaud. The scale of the voyage of anal penetration you are about to embark on has yet to sink in with you, I see. Pray all you want, not god, not the 2. amendment, not whimpering in horror as the markets crash on his first day in office is going to save you. You have elected a man with no experience in foreign or domestic affairs, no grasp of reality, who goes off the rails at the slightest offence on twitter, who most likely will bankrupt your country by building a wall, a man with the temperament and rhetoric of a 5 year old child, who's greatest accomplishment in life (before tricking every one with an IQ less than 100 to vote for him and reducing the presidential election to a very long episode of Jerry Springer) is to make some money off a grand inheritance by stiffing, and scamming everyone in his path. I'll be here, watching from a safe distance, as he burns your shit to the ground and then has you blame someone else for the ashes. Good luck.

d9sox0q,karllucas,"I wonder if i can ask this genuine question without getting down-voted to shit. Did you guys genuinely believe Donald would win? Or was it false-hope that turned into an actual result? It's all damn interesting. Edit: Up-voting all answers, as an Englishman, and honestly heavily left-wing i do find all of this interesting. I can never shit on someone for their opinions because motives behind each and every individuals opinions are interesting. Either way, i feel the whole situation is interesting, congratulations."
d9sp9z9,natman2939,"For a long time I was convinced he would win because I strongly believed that there was a large group of people that didn't want to admit they were voting for him (because of fear of being accused of racism or something else awful like that)But in the last couple of weeks, especially after ""pussygate"" and combined with the fact that the debates were not the earth shattering blow outs I thought they would be....at that point the combination of the polls mixed with my conviction that she could rig it as much as she wanted to and still get away with it made me lose a lot of hope.People said ""she can only rig it X percent"" but after different stories came out in wikileaks and the media DIDNT GIVE A SHIT...I realized this woman could probably do whatever she wants and as long as the media is on her side everyone will just think it's ""right wing conspiracy""So because of those reasons, I was bracing for a loss today.I tried to stay optimistic. The_donald actually helped with that a lot, and I knew I was certainly going to vote and continue to spread the good word no matter whatBut whenever I told someone I thought we had a good chance there was this empty feeling like ""We do have a chance.......right?""And everyone would always just smile politely and say ""um, sure yeah I think we have a chance (anything can happen)"" but it felt like they were humoring me.My poor mom (not a tendie joke, I actually visit my elderly mother a lot) seemed to actually be worried about me because she knew how much it meant to meAnd even said a few times ""look no matter what happens, we'll be okay. It's in God's hands.""So yeah going into Tuesday, I psyched myself up a pretty good bit, but if you go through my post history to Monday and Sunday; you'll probably notice a lot of ""we can't let this movement die, no matter what happens"" kind of posts because I was bracing for a lossBut the irony is my original prediction was right all along (I just lost faith in it due to bullshit polls) and that prediction was that there were a lot of ""secret"" trump fans and also people who had never voted or hadnt voted in a long time that were simply not taken into account because polling usually just looks at people who voted in the last election aka ""likely voters""When it looked like we might lose florida (right at the beginning of the night) I was so pissed and thought ""wow we didn't even put up a fight""But I literally got on my hands and knees and a taste praying harder than I've prayed in my life and suddenly they start calling state after state for TrumpI consider it a modern day miracle"
d9spcd7,Infamy7,"Yes. When his supporters started getting beat up in the streets I knew the country wouldn't stand for that shit. When it turned out a lot of it was staged by the DNC....wew lad! And the MSM treating us like idiots, lying and shitting on us throughout this whole thing, THAT woke this country up BIG LEAGUE!"
d9sp0es,,"I didn't think he would be able to overcome the odds, to be honest. With all the MSM against him, with all the corruption from the Clintons, etc etc. It just seemed like too much. I'm glad I was wrong."
d9spazr,Shitmemery,Until like the last week I thought he could six it but I had completely lost hope. Then when he was winning Virginia holy *shit*
d9spg7u,mynewplan,"I thought he would win mainly by comparing the size of the crowds at the rallies, and comparing the number of followers in the Reddit sites and Tweeter accounts. It just seemed that she wasn't matching the same following as Trump, so that made me optimistic that the polls were not going to match the outcome."
d9spja6,aorshahar,I hoped for the best prepared for the worst. Both with the presidential race and with question 4 in mass. Looks like I got the best of everything.

I knew with every fiber of my being that this was the last chance we as Americans had at reclaiming our country from the corporations, the big banks, the globalists, the leftist ideologues. I always knew in the back of my mind, no matter how much I appeared optimistic on the outside, that this would always be an uphill battle. A classic david vs goliath battle. I convinced everyone I knew that Hillary wasn't the person they thought she was. I supported Trump openly and proudly. I just can't believe we've done it. It's unbelievably surreal. We helped put this man in the white house, and have reshaped the future of our nation, forever. The long hours fighting back against the rigged media, the NeverTrump clowns who doubted our movement every step of the way, and now they all have to eat crow. Congratulations President-Elect Donald J. Trump. We love you. And we're not tired of winning. We need to unite the country, and we will do exactly that but it will take time. Don't gloat too proudly though Trump supporters. We all know there's going to be backlash from the left, and organizations like Black Lives Matter, over the election of Trump. Rise above the fray. For the good of the country.And you know what I'm most excited for? The appointment of Trey Gowdy(Or Guiliani) to Attorney General, and the re-opening of the Clinton email investigation led by a special prosecutor. Even if she doesn't go to jail... An example NEEDS to be made. That this kind of stuff will NO LONGER BE TOLERATED in our government, or by the AMERICAN PEOPLE."

The world was at a crossroads on November 8th, 2016, and it could have gone so very differently than what it did.I was watching the results at work - some people at work knew I was a Trump supporter - and they kept telling ""did you know he's winning?"" and ""how the hell did you predict he was going to win despite everyone saying otherwise?""This day will go down in history for a lot of people in the 'States, and a lot of people worldwide. In fact, 20 years from now, people will probably be asking 'what were you doing the day that Trump was elected President?' and a lot of people will remember.In fact, even 4 months later, people are still screeching about the result, and sadly, probably will be for months to come.Just my thoughts, from a random centipede, on 12th March 2017, 9:33am.

Look at your own community, the schools in your neighborhood....what are a few things they need? What can you do to meet any of those needs?...we need to identify the areas we can all agree on and unite our country.

d9tayy8,Wonderllama5,"I honestly think Hillary was crying her eyes out last night. That's why she couldn't go on stage. This was her life's ambition and *everyone* in the media thought she was gonna win.Goes to show you why Trump was the better candidate. Simply put, Hillary was too *WEAK*!"
d9zvav8,viceroynutegunray,"It's so satisfying knowing all those Hollywood liberal elites were WRONG! WRONG! WRONG!Characters in movies that pushed the ""Hillary Clinton Will Be President For Sure,"" agendaLiz Lemon (30 rock)Leslie Knope (Parks and Rec)Sorority Girls (Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising)I can't think of any more off the top of my head but those are the ones that I found the most disgusting."
d9tyvjr,2016Politics,"Hillary is corrupt, she is not fit for office...and yet I know that she will now be tried for her crimes and the bigger issue now becomes, ""How can we UNITE our country?""Take [the pledge](https://redd.it/5c62vn) to help your community and let's MAGA today!!!"
dbwp9uo,Numero_x,Indian here and yes here we have a group of religious and super conservative folks called Hindu sena (translation: hindu army) who performed havan (a good luck ritual) for Trump's victory before the elections.
dccje9r,auroch27,"It's amazing that after being *proven* wrong, again and again and again, the left *still* thinks they're the smart ones who see through the bullshit. Absolutely amazing."
ddu2q5k,DJStatic,Ok.
ddvgsdm,,Lol this is your only comment in this sub. Ready to MAGA?
ddvu9cx,DJStatic,I don't know. People here in Norway sure as hell aren't.
ddvxgrz,,"Interesting how Norway currently has a Conservative Prime Minister. I'm assuming she is very moderate and on the center-right.The sad thing is how the media misconstrues everything Trump says or does to make it seem negative. In the USA there are lots of alternative outlets at least - Breitbart, InfoWars, Drudge, ZeroHedge, etc., who can counter the mainstream media. That's why the mainstream media has gotten more and more shrill as they lose their grip on the American people.But overseas (and correct me if I'm wrong), the government has a much tighter hold on free speech and the internet. Europeans have no choice but to swallow the mainstream media lies.We are starting to find out that what was dismissed as conspiracies of global shadow governments for years, is actually true. The people are waking up, in the USA and somewhat in Canada.Anyways, the Trump Train is always growing and speeding up every day. If you want to join, we are always open, and if you choose not to that's fine as well. The redpill process takes time."
ddvyjhd,DJStatic,"I'm very undecided when it comes to American politics. I think we should give Trump a chance, but that doesn't directly mean I support him. And though I disagree with some of his choices and ideas, I agree with others. The thing about Anti-Trump Norwegians (From my experience) is that they have no fucking clue what they are talking about. They straight up hate Trump, and when you ask them why, they usually answer something like ""Because he's an asshole"". It's kind of a trend to hate Trump here, so people actually don't care about the politics and just hate because others do."

d9ssuv4,1005thArmbar,"Get ready for more salt, guys. Hillary currently has a very slim 100,000 vote lead in the popular vote. I hope it doesn't last, but at the same time, I don't fucking care. Trump won because the Electoral College exists. Everyone knew the rules of the election going in. If people don't like it, they can fight to change it, but it's not my fucking problem. We won, too bad."
d9ssz2m,,"oh god every SJW is now going to crow that the electoral college is sexist and racist and Russia.Fact is, I think it is bullshit. But it is the rules. Maybe Trump can get rid of it for the next election? Maybe get rid of special interests and money in politics?Remember folks, Trump won w/o being beholden to anyone except us, the american people.

Hillary started to have a seizure and a large black man stabbed her with an autoinjector and she started frothing at the mouth. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean for that to happen to Hillary but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is she losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe Trump has the dankest memes. I want to be stronger together. I want Hillary to be president and let in more refugees. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought she was polling well in Virginia???? This is so fucked."

d9t52f8,Elevated_Dongers,Yeah I noticed that too. He probably didn't do it on purpose but yeah kind of a dick move. He called some other dude to say a few words but not pence.
d9t5ywk,Getmeamfcoat,"I don't think he did it on purpose either. I just kept watching and waiting for him to say, ""And to the person who's been alongside me this entire campaign. . ."" etc. and it never came.

d9sp345,NeenerNanner,I know.. we really need voter ID laws and NO electronic machines of any kind.
d9sppux,,that's what I think. he must have made a deal not to prosecute in exchange for consession
d9sq3am,blumpkinblake,I hope not. We can't just expose all this corruption and not have justice. Especially when there is evidence of global child sex trafficking. I bet he has some really damming evidence of something that he would use if she tried to challenge it.He didn't even have to release his tax returns and he still won. I think he's saving them for next election when he really wants someone to look bad. Trump knows what he's doing.

He now has the moral ground to not support any corrupt or establishment sanctioned motives or suggestions by his party citing their lack of support for his candidacy.

d9skioz,,SO PROUD OF ALL MY AMERICAN CENTIPEDES. MAGA BITCHES.
d9slikl,water_closet_warrior,"Hello centipedes, i'm not american (i wouldn't vote for Trump if i were, but i guess i would prefer him over hillary), and now that he won, theres a few things i'd like to ask, in case anyone is kind enough to answer.I have a few concerns regarding Trump's presidency, specially on his instance of Climate Change, can anyone provide me with any answers on wether he is going to tackle this problem or is he's just going to ignore or maybe even make the situation worse.I'm not falling into the End of the World narrative, but i'd fairly concerned with the issue of Energy and Climate, and i hope someone can answer me.Congratulations on your victory,cheers"
d9slpow,calvinball14,"currently, ""global warming"" is a democrat tax plan looking for a problem. no one disagrees that pollution is bad, but it's about regulation and pocket-picking with the dems.Trump is your best chance, of anyone running, for PRACTICAL solutions to problems such as this - changes that address root causes, not just democrat hard-ons for my paycheck."
d9sm5jj,ElegantBiscuit,"The place you're looking for is probably /r/AskThe_Donald, but I'll give you my answer. I'm actually majoring in environmental science and I plan to make a career out of it, and I'm a Trump voter. I have several reasons. First, Hillary would say anything to get elected and do nothing, she has lied so much that nothing she says can be taken as the truth. Her alliances lie with the special interests who funded her campaign and made her rich, including Saudi Arabia who is one of the biggest producers of oil in the world, and if you believe the conspiracy theories (which are just barely connected enough to make sense), they wanted an oil pipeline into Europe and the war in Syria is a proxy war to help make that happen, Russia is against it as they are the worlds second largest producer of natural gas behind us and would benefit from selling to Europe, she has been behind the keystone pipeline vigorously despite how her public stance on the matter changed, she has backed the TPP vigorously despite how her public opinion changed and countries that would benefit from the deal mostly produce goods by factories which are terrible for the environment, she would probably be bought out by the fracking industry anyways, so that wouldn't change, not to mention potential nuclear winter by blaming Russia for all her treason and hiding her corruption. Now that that's covered, onto Trump and what I believe he will do. Honestly I believe that we have bigger problems to deal with because we won't be able to do anything about the climate if we don't have a functional country anymore (although that's getting into other stuff), someone will always be there to dig up that coal, drill for that oil, extract that natural gas. In the end, my answer is that the earth will always be here, and I believe the best way people will learn and accept climate change is to learn from past mistakes, or else other people will just call into question your hypothetical scenarios."
d9slyr0,MusicSac,"Well he's scrapping the clean energy fund, which was hugely expensive. He doesnt want climate regulation/policy to slow down business. Big supporter of coal, oil... Your best hope is that he is pro-nuclear. Personally, I don't expect the country to give off too much more emissions compared to right now, but it will likely increase."
d9slnaz,furluge,"He is probably going to ignore. Do not worry, any candidate would ignore for the most part. It is mostly just lip service and a way to justify giving money to friends under the guise of helping fight global warming."
d9slztn,water_closet_warrior,"I understand that, it's exactly what i think Hillary would do in the case of her victory, use it to get more votes, and ignore it afterwards (maybe sign an agreement or another, since they're not legally binding). but oh well, i guess it's just politics as always."

d9sraam,RedSocks157,"Open up competition across state borders. Think of it the same way you think of cable/internet right now...if you open up competition and break the state-created monopolies, the competition will drive prices down.Trump is also a fan of special, tax-exempt accounts for healthcare savings."
d9st34u,Ralpfv,"This is the first step that needs to be taken, I have been saying it for 9 years now. We need to know what the market will look like without government enforced monopolies before we can move forward."
d9srcy4,BlackJack1931,"Thank you for the honest and detailed response (not being sarcastic).>Trump is also a fan of special, tax-exempt accounts for healthcare savings.We already have those. If you are enrolled in a high deductible plan, you can make pre-tax contributions that grow tax-free and are withdrawn tax free as well as long as you use them for medical expenses. At age 65, you can start withdrawing money from your HSA for non-medical expenses."
d9srhnn,RedSocks157,"Happy to answer. I think a lot of people are going to realize in the coming days that the ridiculous image of Trump that Hillary put forth was not accurate at all. He really did take those slings and arrows for us so that we could have our voices heard.I really believe he wants to make America great again. Not just for the banks, not just for the elite, and not just for his voters - for all of us!"
d9srjso,BlackJack1931,"Thanks for the friendly reply, but you did not answer my question about healthcare :) Any thoughts? I personally think we're going to see ACA repealed and replaced with competition between states (Trump seems to like that), while keeping HSAs and the ability for those with pre-existing conditions to keep insurance. I would much rather prefer single payer, but I will keep an open mind. Thanks again for the reply."
d9srqmj,RedSocks157,"I agree with most of your prediction. I think there will be some sort of stipulation for people with preexisting conditions, and I certainly don't want to see anyone go without healthcare who needs it.The beautiful thing about an open market system versus a single-payer system is this, which I think you'll like. The companies have to compete. That means no massive run-ups in price, which a single payer system encourages. You could see the beginnings of this with Obamacare - the insurance companies were raising their prices because they had no reason not to with the massive stipends and such. They were going to get paid no matter what because the government was going to give out as much money as people needed to be able to pay those prices.With a free market system, with competition across borders between ALL the companies, they will have to price their plans accordingly. This means that the people will get better prices, *and* the government will not be giving away huge amounts of money to make it affordable. Think of all the money that *won't* be flooding into the insurance companies - if there's one thing I think we can all agree on, it's that corporate executives make too much money!"
d9ss51m,BlackJack1931,"Thank you for the detailed and friendly response. I hope that this can be the discourse over the next four years and a sign that we can work together :)How does free market competition affect increases in the prices of drugs such as the EpiPen? Only one company makes that product, so what is keeping that company from juicing the prices? Before you tell me that it will drive innovation for better products, please keep in mind that drugs tend to have long patents that prevent that.Thanks again for the detailed response."
d9ssdxv,RedSocks157,"I hope so to! I really want to see us make progress and I hope that everyone is as open-minded about what comes next.With insurance prices going down, the insurance companies will not be willing to pay as high of a price for the drugs because they aren't bringing in as much money from their customers. If the drug company wants to be able to sell their drugs, they have to price them at a point that the insurance companies will be willing to pay for people's prescriptions.I'm working on my MBA right now, a lot of this stuff is pretty simplified economics. There is a lot that goes into what happens in a market, but this is the general drift of things if the market is allowed to operate freely. Keep in mind that it sometimes takes the market a little while to adjust to new circumstances - it might even be a few years before we really see the impact of this kind of policy ripple out. But the end result is ultimately inevitable; the market will settle on an equilibrium point where the prices are as low as they can be while still generating a profit. Again, this might take time!"

d9srnob,BlackJack1931,"Thanks for the response and being willing to admit that at least part of the ACA was good. I would agree with you. I was never a fan of the ACA, but allowing more people to get insurance was a good part. Are you personally against single payer? Just trying to get a feel for your opinion as, to be quite honest, most people I know are pretty liberal."
d9sv1lo,,[deleted]
d9svs53,BlackJack1931,"Thanks for the nice discussion. It was good learning your position, though, we definitely disagree on single payer. Hopefully our sides can work together for the next four years :)"
d9ssz4t,Ralpfv,"Trump has mentioned that that is part of his thought process anyway, there aren't many details at the moment. That is very important."
d9stasv,Ralpfv,"To add to what has been said we need to find a way to bring drug prices down. There has to be a middle ground between the drug companies making enough money to promote continued development and the obscene prices that a lot of drugs have right now. I don't have solutions, but drug prices are a big problem."
d9sthog,BlackJack1931,"Thanks for the friendly response :)Are you against forcing drugs prices down via regulation? To me, regulation is about the only way to accomplish this. The issue is that drugs are only invented and sold if they are highly profitable. We could limit patent terms or remove patents altogether, but I just don't think that solves the issue or even addresses it.Happy to hear what you or anyone else thinks, even if you disagree with me."
d9sttgv,Ralpfv,"Regulation is always a last resort in my mind. Personally I would like to see what the numbers would look like if the government would be able to buy out patents with the purpose of ripping up said patent (and not be able to do anything else with it). The government spent a lot of money on healthcare before Obamacare, if we can spend some money upfront to spend less down the line, that is a win-win, but without numbers it hard to see if that is a logical move to make."

I was gracious to all the horrible msgs I got from people telling them today I hope we could come together.**But Clinton nor those involved with the Clinton foundation are getting a pass. The shit they are into is not just talking points for the election. They MUST be held accountable.##We still must drain the swamp.edit: Upon further thought, we need to make sure we're NOT hiding but are in fact sharing that she did do things like cheat during debates or rig the primaries against Bernie. These things speak to her character (lack of it), and they are just the surface. What's really been happening is much, much more severe and people need to get used to the fact that she's an evil, selfish woman. This never had anything to do with ""me vs. them"" or ""dems vs. repubs.""This deals with treason, human rights violations, selling of power and influence to the highest bidder, auctioning of ambassadorships, bribery for seats *in Obama's cabinet,* Benghazi cover up and the STILL existing email investigation for both her and the Clinton Foundation, stealing funds that were supposed to go to Haiti, ties to sex slaves / human trafficking, open borders, etc.This is only the beginning, and it's going to hurt a LOT of people if they're willing to face it. I believe many won't though, and we'll be back to us vs. them (thank the media narrative who are already spinning again) in no time.I think I'm going to make this an original post with this in it.. haha"

Please cite data to prove your claim.

d9sqtlx,louwish,Thanks for the response. Fortune ran a piece on this just yesterday. http://fortune.com/2016/11/08/china-automation-jobs/
d9sqazh,smushkreeg,Elections are rigged. Not all and sometimes calling it out can help prevent the rigging. Just tell that to Bernie.
d9sqsvd,Commyende,"Keep in mind that Trump's unpinning philosophy is pure pragmatism. He is also a natural negotiator, and many of his positions/threats are meant purely as negotiating tactics (he's said so himself). As someone who has been watching him closely this election cycle, I think I can give fairly good predictions of what he'll do.>foreign policyHe won't end NATO, but countries will either have to pay their fair share, as stipulated by the treaty, or they'll no longer receive free protection from the US. He'll also shift NATO's missions towards fighting terrorism. This is something they've already made steps towards after he stated that they needed to do this. He's already started leading the world months before he was elected.>tradeThreats of tariffs are almost certainly a negotiating tactic designed to force other countries to behave. China, Mexico, and many other countries have taken advantage of our unwillingness to even put up a fight. Make no mistake, trade wars have been waged for decades and America has simply allowed itself to be attacked. And if other nations simply refuse to behave, Trump is absolutely willing to enact these tariffs. From a game theory perspective, his approach is the correct one. International trade is very much like the iterated prisoner's dilemma problem. Our current and past politicians had a policy of unconditional cooperation, leaving us open for exploitation. Trump will use tit-for-tat, which is cooperative, but willing to fight back against bad actors.>progressive policyTrump has given out a list of people he could nominate as SC judges, and that list has been praised by people on both sides of the aisle. They aren't extreme right wing, religious nuts, but there may be some changes. He wants things like abortion and marijuana to be returned to the states' control. His health care plan is detailed on his website, but the broad strokes are to implement more market-based solutions, such as increasing choice through cross-state insurance offerings and allowing all health care costs to be tax deductible. My hope is that this all leads to us getting health care away from the employer-provided model and to a more standard model (like how you buy car insurance), which would drive prices much lower due to people getting exactly the insurance plan they want. He has stated repeatedly that he wants to keep pre-existing conditions covered by insurance."
d9sqv30,louwish,"Thank you for your detailed answer. I might not have agreed with you at the polls, but I want this country to succeed. Much obliged!"
d9sqrx4,DAR1776,"We will just have to wait and see then, won't we. We are happy and celebrating. We have spent months researching Hillary's history and corruption and trying to share that information to as many people as we can.

d9sp08g,PlayerofVideoGames,"That's because she broke a law. Others did what she did, but to a smaller degree, and they still went to prison. She did this while in office. Hence why people called her corrupt and called for her imprisonment. I mean, that's not name-calling, that's just using words correctly."

d9sjn39,,"Frankly thats not enough. Listen the hate comes from both sides and both sides need to acknowledge that. This doesnt need to become a US equivalent of the middle east conflict where blame is constantly shifted to each party. Again I stress im like center as can be. During this campaign I rooted for the underdogs which was you guys. Now you are the winners. While Trump congratulated hillary its still not enough in my opinion at least. But who knows its like 3am everyone is tired. But he needs to do more. And more importantly so does THIS thread. People need to come together and more crucially indulge in some reconciliation to a certain extent. This goes to both sides. Again I know this sucks coming from a ""cop out"" on the fence whatever you wanna call me. Im saying: gloating doesn't help. Show respect toward each other. This isnt just to the donald supporters but to everyone. Even though you won so the ball is in your court and you need to lead the movement to unite the country. Not only trump. While trump began to do that, he still needs to do more."

d9skw40,LegendaryAmerican,"Hey there. First off, despite what you might think about us, I promise we all love this country and just want the best for it. We are not racist, sexist, violent, homophobic or anything else the media makes us out to be. Sure there are outliers, as there are with every candidate. Today, blacks, latinos, whites, men, women, etc. voted for Trump in large numbers.That said, there is still a lot of work to do. Trump's plan is not about isolationism or hatred. It's first and foremost about protecting Americans. That means through security and monetary means. He loves immigrants, he's married to one after all. You just have to do it legally, it's only fair and safe for our citizens. In Europe, the migrant crisis is a gigantic problem. The FBI and CIA have said ISIS and other terrorist groups will infiltrate the program into America. They already have in Europe. How do we protect ourselves while also helping out the families trying to escape war? Temporarily disable immigration from terrorist hotbeds and develop a system to extremely vet people from there. Obama did something similar in Iraq in 2011. Once that system is in place, we will let them in legally. In the meantime, we will help those wanting to escape war by building safe areas with our protection in neighboring countries.As far as our economy, focusing on Americans. Bringing jobs backs from overseas, negotiating better trade deals, lowering business regulations, less government involvement. Obamacare is really hurting businesses especially this next year. MAGA is taking what's working with our country and keeping it, and taking what's not working and changing it. Then there is the issue of corruption. It permeates Washington. People get positions based on how much money they donate. Special interests, Wall Street, lobbyists, banks all run Washington. In the leaks we even see that Obama's administration was picked by a bank. Giving people positions based on merit should be a start.All I can think of right now, but we can talk later when I'm not falling asleep in my chair!"
d9u3ynk,master_west,"Thank you for your answer! I understand, and I recognize many of the ""bigots"" who support Trump are labeled as such by far left wingers who prevent logical and objective discussions to take place. My dad and I talked about it, and I realized he's pretty excited about a Trump presidency. After 9/11, Hillary apparently said that all Muslims should be placed in interment camps. She got the candidacy though corruption and lies, and she epitomizes the kind of shady politics you see in ""House of Cards"" (hopefully without all the murder). However, the things Trump had said haven't been too attractive either. But I see he's a gutsy motherfucker with a 10/10 wife, so we have a model as first lady ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞). It's going to be interesting to see a man run this country who is not bound to fulfilling the kickbacks and favors that fuels the corruption in Washington. He's seen money, so he doesn't need that. He has a very unique opportunity to do something great for this country. News outlets don't realize that many folks found out their medical insurance premiums increased, driving them to vote for Trump in order to repeal Obamacare. His 100 day plan is sensible, and doesn't contain anything racially divisive. If he wants to build a wall, go ahead. There are processes in place to obtain a citizenship legally. Therefore, I see why Trump can be a positive figure in the political system, objectively speaking. The far left is fucking nuts, and maybe they need a reality check."
d9v81wk,LegendaryAmerican,"It's nice talking to someone who voted for Hillary that is not saying I am a ""racist homophobe bigot"" for voting Trump. Refreshing really. Not sure how Trump is either honestly. The first 3 people announced to be in his administration are a gay man, a black man, and woman... yet the media tells us he hates those groups... The best part is, it has nothing to do with those reasons (sure it helps). But Ben Carson was the head of neurosurgeons at John Hopkins and an incredibly smart medical professional. He's gonna be in charge of healthcare and replacing Obamacare. Peter Thiel is a genius in the tech world, scouted Elon Musk and invested in him and started PayPal and helped invest in Facebook early. He'll be in charge of technology and innovation (advisor) to Trump. KellyAnne Conway helped Trump get elected, a guy who the entire media and world seemed to be against, with no backings and no help from either party, 95% of donations from the people, no help from PACs or special interests, and the biggest upset in political history. She will be in his administration too.3 people that are on his team and helping to run positions that they SHOULD BE AND DESERVE TO RUN BECAUSE OF EXPERIENCE. Not because of the color of their skin or their private parts (unlike Obama who Wikileaks showed picked people based on skin color or gender or big donors suggested by CitiBank who didn't have the necessary experience).He's not even in office and here's what's happened: stock markets have never been higher in our history, Russia wants peace with us now in letter from Putin, Israeli president overjoyed, Egyptian and Philippines presidents overjoyed, Canada and Mexican leaders already announced they are willing to rework NAFTA, etc. Because just a small threat from Trump holds weight. With Obama, they knew they could get away with anything (line in the sand). With Trump, if you don't do what you say, sorry too bad you're out. The threat of knowing that will keep people in line.Thanks for your positive outlook and willingness to give him a chance. If you can, please share your reasoning with any friends or family you have who are nervous. The media has painted Trump as Hitler for 2 years now, so people are acting accordingly. Thanks!"

I'm from Washington state, we're a lot quieter here. I still don't get the best vibe from him but as of now my opinion doesn't matter.

d9sr8m5,Sock_Monster,Please give me one example of how he is racist
d9srt8z,akaranzo,"Did you not hear him discriminate against all muslims and mexicans for example? He's fucking obviously a man who looks at the skin color of a person and assumes everything about them that instant. The whole ''build a wall'' thing is racist, sure illegal immigrants aren't good but do you really think that's why he came up with that idea? No. He just can't stand the idea that a person with darker skin can have a job while a white man can't."
d9symg8,Sock_Monster,"When we build the wall, I hope he throws you on the other side of it."
d9sr9h9,TheFlying-Dutchman,At least I didn't vote for a lying corrupt person!!
