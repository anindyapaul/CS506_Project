dvwost8,Fiending4Krokodil,">""Not only do traditional notions of masculinity prevent men from seeking counseling or other forms of help they need, help which may prevent these mass shootings, but violence is also inculcated as a more masculine alternative than help seeking,"" Kimmel and Leek wrote. >Men are less likely than women to seek mental health care for depression, substance abuse and stress, according to the American Psychological Association.This is one of the core problems in our country. It's easy to demonize mass shooters, but they were mentally ill before they picked up a gun. One way to prevent mass shootings is to reach these people and give them the professional help they need."
dvwua82,Spiel_Foss,"In a country where people with insurance can't afford to go to the doctor for physical ailments, any appeal for greater mental healthcare will require a complete change in the US healthcare system.To hear Republicans say that ""mental health"" is a major issue in mass gun violence is simply a rhetorical dodge. Addressing mental health issues will never happen as long as Republicans and their corporate Democratic counterparts control the country,"
dvwp6hc,DaGoz,Another way is to prevent their access to the tools they use to commit mass murder.
dvwp836,joyRN,Why not both?
dvxvu1v,LiberalConservative3,Because one would be a violation of rights.
dvwpzcj,BawsDaddy,"Taking away their access to guns is the easiest and quickest way to fix the problem. Mental illness should absolutely be addressed, but this idea that we can just throw money at mental health and that'll prevent mass shootings while still being able to access firearms is absurd and dangerous."
dvwrb59,spacehogg,Especially true since the GOP is the one promoting the idea of addressing mental illness when they are the party that has zero desire to address any healthcare in the US at all!

dvxv817,BawsDaddy,"Completely agree. Which is why we need to register and regulate gun ownership. Adopt what Australia has put in place similar to that of vehicles. Require licensing and training. During that time, an experienced gun safety training (more than likely ex-military/police) will train people while simultaneously evaluating their mental stability. If this system was put in place we wouldn't need to ban ar-15's and the like. We'd have strenuous safety training."
dvy23dr,DisagreeableFool,"How would police / ex military train people on firearms and be qualified to judge mental stability? A individual qualified to do that would have to be a psychiatric doctor, anything less would be guess work combined with seeing only the most blatantly obvious of mental illness. The cost to have psych doctors see everyone who owns a gun would be astronomical."
dvy2psa,BawsDaddy,"I mean, you'd have them as a filter. If they see something suspicious then they forward the applicants file to a psych to get professionally evaluated. It wouldn't be perfect, but it's astronomically better than our current system. And these people can have basic training on recognizing indicators. I know police already go through these basic indicator training."
dvydbin,DisagreeableFool,Most mental illnesses are not something you can see with your eyes. Some barely trained individuals with just picture references would do more harm than good when evaluating people. Police are not currently the golden standard when it comes to public relations and job training.I just don't see how your solution would add any real positives to the situation.
dvws9pn,neuhmz,Easier to take away a right from all people then fix the suffering of an individual.
dvwsftw,BawsDaddy,"Ugh, so absurd."
dvwsmaa,neuhmz,"yeah your argument lacks a lot of substance, and again seems to be a solution based on laziness and apathy to the individual."
dvwt2di,BawsDaddy,So does yours. You accuse me of wanting to take everyone's guns away without any evidence of it... What do you call that again? Oh right... You lack substance.

dvxezt1,bobbleheaddo,so people with claustrophobia shouldn't be allowed to own guns?
dvwstbe,Barnabys_Choice,"The people do not have those ""rights"" You can't detect mental illness or persecution or even the bullying that precedes many of the murders, but you can limit access to the weapons they often choose to ""deal'' with their problems"

Even the VT kill had been cleared from a psych eval before the shooting. How do you determine when someone should lose their rights?"
dvwu21v,Barnabys_Choice,"When you are born, you have the right to learn what you are taught, do what you are told and have no right to bear firearms. Do you agree with that?"

dvx54v1,neuhmz,You are born with the right to bear arms the same way you born with the right to vote. There are restraints that children have in their rights till they grow older. That being said I had my grandfather's Enfield in my bed room since I was 8. How do you claim a person does not have the right to own a firearm? Or are you trying to build a strawman where you paint me as wanting 12 year Olds to buy guns?
dvx5f36,Barnabys_Choice,"So, your ""rights"" come with conditions. Thank you for acknowledging that.Where are the restrictions mentioned?"
dvx7ekk,neuhmz,Seems the founders from the militia acts 1790's intended for the right as to start at 17 seems like 18 as is the age of maturity is when the right kicks in. What resrictions do you propose?
dvx8gb9,Barnabys_Choice,"Not a detailed list but some ideas based on our systemKeep weapons in militias such as police, military, national guard and so on, where firearms related attitude, registration, training, storage, use and reporting is tightly regulated.allow some slow fire firearms for huntingrapid firing firearms are not needed outside of militias and should not be available to the public, except under tightly regulated circumstances.Low levels of civilian firearms exposes criminals much earlier.It works here but could be improved, even though we are already at one tenth of your disaster rate."

dvx7upu,Barnabys_Choice,Not true. The free citizens of Rome and Greece and for thousands of years did not have the right to have firearms. And the people were not allowed arms in their villages.This is specific problem of the last few centuries and differs in the speed of slaughter and the range of slaughter. This capability has always been reserved for militias and adopted by private bulliesNo-one has the right to threaten or slaughter another and slaughter is what's happening in the US and at 10 times the rate of even freer nations like Australia.

It is illegal to threaten to kill people here, infact if the local police and FBI had been doing their job the park land shooting would have never happened because he would have been made a prohibitied person and that would have never had arms, and he would be in jail for assault with a deadly weapon for holding a gun to somebodies head. We have the laws to prevent this, what we need is the enforcement.Australia is not the perfect case sample their firearms ownership rate has increased to beyond preconfiscation levels but their crime rate remained low.Australia had a murder rate of 1.9 in 1990 which has declined to 1.1 in 2013, a 42.1% reduction.America had a 9.4 murder rate in 1990 which has reduced to 4.5 in 2013, a 52.1% reduction.That data give us 145,902 violent crimes in Australia for 1996 in which Australia had a population of about 18.31 million. That gives us a violent crime rate of 796.8 per 100k.In 2007 Australia had 215,208 violent crimes with a population of about 20.31 million giving it a crime rate of 1059.61. An increase of 24.7%.Meanwhile the US violent crime rate in 96 was 636.63 which dropped to 471.8 in 2007. A 25.9% decrease.In 2007 the violent crime rate in Australia was over twice what it was in America by those numbers.Even the [Melbourne University's report ""The Australian Firearms Buyback and Its Effect on Gun Deaths""](https://www.melbourneinstitute.com/miaesr/publications/working-paper-series/abstract-178.html) Found, ""Homicide patterns (firearm and nonfirearm) were not influenced by the NFA. They therefore concluded that the gun buy back and restrictive legislative changes had no influence on firearm homicide in Australia."""
dvx8nhs,Barnabys_Choice,You gave away your new disguise neuhmz.Bye
dvx8qwt,neuhmz,What a waste try to actually have an intelligent conversation about gun control and never get an intelligent answer :( Have a good night read and learn buddy.
dvxzpl4,Throwawayihatenaming,"How the fuck are the police going to ""do their job"" when you make buying guns for people like cruz legal? What, the fbi should have arrested him for having a gun people are allowed to have? Sorry man but your entire argument is ignorant, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about. This is about your ""right"" to have shooty bang bang toys vs the right of people to not be ripped to shreds with metal projectiles. Sometimes we have to weight stupid luxuries vs people's safety. This is like saying you have a right to speed at a million miles an hour because you're an angsty teenager who doesn't like being told what to do, or ""you're the exception"". Until we can outlaw mental illness (hint: you'll never be able to) there's only one solution."

dvws8fv,,[deleted]
dvwsk2u,BawsDaddy,You actually believe that you can just go fix someone that is mentally ill? You think that mental health care is just going to eliminate shootings? And mass shootings are a horrific problem that should take precedence.
dvwson0,Barnabys_Choice,"You can't detect hate and madness easily, but you sure can control access to firearms and ammunition."
dvwufrr,welshwelsh,"Which is why it's a bad solution. It's like taking a gun away from a suicidal person and thinking the problem is solved. I fear that if we simply stop school shootings, everyone will ignore the issue again because it might not affect their kid.We can't take the easy way out on this one. School shootings are just the tip of the iceberg, a symptom of a much bigger problem. For each kid so hopeless and miserable he tries to kill all of his classmates, how many boys are similarly distressed, just not to the point where they might kill someone?"
dvwvgjg,Barnabys_Choice,"Not at all like taking a gun away from a suicidal person.The foreign and Russian funded NRA claims that mass firearms makes us safe, but that's a lie. In Australia we are proof that the NRA policy is a lie.Keeping firearms out of the hands of the general public keeps us safe. We see it in Australia, where we have one tenth of the number of firearms, per person, and one tenth of the number of firearms related deaths and injuries, per person.The NRA is funded by foreigners who's main focus is to rip the US apart and also to profit from foreign sales of firearms to the US.Many US citizens believe that they need more powerful weapons to combat the forearms nightmare that the US is in.Most US citizens do not believe that and do not support firearms in the general public.Beacause of the US policies, All get to suffer from the business-inspired madness"
dvy8dvz,betaking12,">The NRA is funded by foreigners who's main focus is to rip the US apart and also to profit from foreign sales of firearms to the US.I think the ""Foreigners"" in question are probably sponsoring both sides of this debate in order to create chaos."

dwcmslv,hamhamsg,The one making the claim is responsible for substantiating it. You pussied out
dwcuzij,Barnabys_Choice,2 for starters1) [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/15/nra-russia-and-trump-money-laundering-poisoning-us-democracy-commentary.html)2) [Ronald Horvarth](https://knox.villagesoup.com/p/the-nra-russia-connection/1725566)And the NRA refusing to discuss it.
dwd9szj,hamhamsg,">1) CNBC According to the Newsweek article they use as a source: >No public evidence that the NRA took Russian money has emerged, and spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told NPR ""The National Rifle Association has not been contacted by the FBI or any other investigative body."" Boy, that sure is convincing. So what we know is there's an FBI investigation of one Russian banker and *zero* evidence of it actually occurring is available to the public. Everything else is pure speculation. A pretty far cry from “Russians fund NRA = well known”, isn't it? The truly ironic thing is your first source is based on an article that directly states you're wrong. >2) Ronald Horvarth I'm actually impressed. I don't think I've ever read more biased garbage in my life. The piece harps about Russian support for Trump without ever acknowledging the well known fact that they supported both sides to sow division. Including [organizing liberal protests] (http://theweek.com/speedreads/734756/thousands-people-marched-against-trump-last-november-russia-secretly-organized-that-protest), [supporting kneeling NFL players] (https://www.npr.org/2017/10/30/560042987/russians-targeted-u-s-racial-divisions-long-before-2016-and-black-lives-matter) while increasing the rhetoric and tension , and was involved with [black lives matter] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/opinions/global-opinions/if-russia-can-create-fake-black-lives-matter-accounts-who-will-next/2017/10/15/ffb2e01e-af79-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.html). He also refers to a US citizen, Len Blavatnik, as a “foreigner” to build his narrative. Truly a trustworthy piece my friend. And at the end of this garbage what are we left with? >No public evidence that the NRA took Russian money has emerged, and spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told NPR ""The National Rifle Association has not been contacted by the FBI or any other investigative body."" Still waiting for a source that collaborates your claims."
dwdnggx,Barnabys_Choice,"This ""source"" business is not as easy as I thought. I'll get back to you when I find one.While we are on that subject though, what is your source for this?;> Including organizing liberal protests, supporting kneeling NFL players"

The Russian group under the name “BlackMattersUS”, one of many, brought thousands out to protest Trump, and regularly released anti-police posts and podcasts."
dwdq5kb,Barnabys_Choice,"nah, come on man! While I am likely to agree with the idea of Russia sponsoring all this scat, you demand hard evidence and your sources are as weak as the ones I provided. C'mon, ante up and give me something along the lines that would make YOU happy as evidence. This stuff is ""he said that they wrote that she thought about..."""
dwds70f,hamhamsg,I'm not sure what part of it you disagree with. Every claim made in that article is well sourced. That [BlackMattersUS] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/thinkprogress.org/nolan-hack-interview-44d4f65a675f/amp/) was a Russian group in disguise and organized the protest?.

Which source or claim specifically do you have a problem with?
dwdumzq,Barnabys_Choice,"Show the sources. Re-read the source articles and analyse them using the rigour that you demand. Nothing in here is the result of an investigation. These are no more than news outlets cherry-picking articles on other news outlets that are reporting on suspicions. At least with my claim, you agree, below, that there is an investigation and we all know that the FBI will not launch an investigation based on pure speculation . I do like it how you have added that little line that ""zero evidence... is available to the public"" Of course it isn't, it's an investigation and you make that out as proof of ""nothing"". You've studied Sophistic refutation, haven't you?>Boy, that sure is convincing. So what we know is there's an FBI investigation of one Russian banker and zero evidence of it actually occurring is available to the public. Everything else is pure speculation.You've done well by blurting out ""Source?"" but not when providing your own. It's a clever, but shallow, debating tactic. Everything you've written is pure speculation. An article that quotes an article that quotes an article is not ""well sourced""So, can we agree that it is ""clear"" that the ""reporting"" is pointing to Russian interests influencing the US public in order to destabilise the country? Equally, can we agree that it is just as ""clear"" that the reporting is pointing to Russian interests infiltrating the NRA, AND there is an FBI investigation into the matter.Can we discuss an easy way to stop men and boys killing Waay too many people and move the numbers of firearms related deaths, injury and social destruction down to at least Australian levels?"
dwdw4m8,hamhamsg,"You don't make any sense. Every one of those sources are left-leaning. You're suggesting that NPR, ThinkProgress, and The Washing Post are all colluding to push a false story about Russians organizing some liberal protests? You realize how idiotic that is right?"
dwdwnnz,Barnabys_Choice,"Neither the >NPR, ThinkProgress, and The Washing Post is a ""source"". C'mon, where is your real source? or, as you put it,>Still waiting for a source that collaborates your claims.As I wrote before>This ""source"" business is not as easy as I thought."

dwdx65z,Barnabys_Choice,"Finally, a cop out. Too difficult for you?A ""source"" is the original data., and is meant to be the origin of the material used by news organisations to either disseminate or manipulate.

dvwzssa,T3hoofs,Very good point. Without access to guns a large portion of this will evaporate. With that said..nah detecting madness isn't all that difficult. Mental illness is different from say...being a racist. Let's say we were to ban anyone found to have expressed racist views from owning anything other than a handgun. Same goes for someone who has abused their wife or significant other. Same goes for people found to have abused their kid or someone elses kid. You know..just starting off slow. How much death would that stop almost immediately?
dvx0od9,Barnabys_Choice,"Starting off slow is where we are at already. People don't come forward with that stuff. There are no hate or undisclosed mental illness detectors available. Look at the #metoo movement. It's so difficult to tell either what others have done to you, or to admit to what you've done to others.The nightmare that sends people mad is nearly always so well hidden that we can only treat it after an event.Restricting the tools that they use to inflict hate has helped in societies like Australia. The US is no different."
dvx1c49,T3hoofs,....yeah we aren't. I said that if i person is found to have done those things or has had those ideas that they are only allowed to buy a handgun. As far i know nothing like that currently exists.
dvx3dit,Barnabys_Choice,"Why allow handguns? They are rapidfire and a disaster at close rangeA well regulated Militia is the place for firearms, not loose in amongst the unsuspecting public."
dvx3zhq,T3hoofs,"I honestly have no clue what you mean by that last statement but as i said...it would me moving slowly. Even then though with those parameters i would imagine it would cut down gun related murders and death by almost half. Seeing as how most mass/school shooters hate at least one race, gender or etc.Also, it's harder to mow down groups of people with a handgun vs an ar-15 (or something to that effect)."
dvx5b1d,Barnabys_Choice,"Keep all rapidfire firearms away from the fickle public. That works instantly.Why let someone who has flipped, or will flip, as happens so very often, buy a handgun. Handguns are heavily used in murder and mass shootings"

It's not
dvyg3pv,Familiar_Owl,"Gun crime is at an all-time low in the USA. It has been dropping steadily since the 1980's. I'm sure your media has got you believing some other nonsense.

dvy2okm,-RUSSIAN-HACKER-,"> Let's say we were to ban anyone found to have expressed racist views from owning anything other than a handgun.Why don't we just ban them from owning any firearm? If we banned everyone who's ever said anything racist, then pretty much 90% of blacks would be barred from owning firearms. All the anti white racists would be stripped of their weaponry, and seeing as blacks commit the vast majority of all gun crimes, the violence in Chicago, Detroit, and all the inner cities would decrease dramatically.This is actually an amazing idea that you've proposed. It's time to ban racists from owning firearms. It's time to disarm black Americans."
dvy2ysg,T3hoofs,"Wow...that was clearly racist. lol With that said though..good luck making that happen with white racists protecting said ""black racists"" and making it so mass shootings and school shootings happen often. lolThe fun part of your comment also goes into other places too. ""It's time to disarm black Americans."" So i guess you mean then that only black americans shouldn't be able to own guns...cause fuck everything you would say about free speech and amendments an etc but...only for and against black people. lolYou guys just can't stop shooting yourselves in the feet can you?"
dvy5fz6,-RUSSIAN-HACKER-,">Wow...that was clearly racist.What was racist about it? It's a fact that African Americans commit the majority of firearm crimes and homicides. This is well documented.>So i guess you mean then that only black americans shouldn't be able to own gunsNot at all, I'm just repeating what you said. You said those who make racist statements should be banned from owning firearms. That would ban the majority of African Americans from owning fire arms. It would essentially disarm blacks in America.I haven't really given any opinions of my own here."
dvy918k,T3hoofs,Your focus is entirely and solely on black people. So yeah you're opinion was not only given but very noted. :)
dw97ea9,the_blur,"Black Americans are about 13% of the population and commit almost 40% of the murders in a country of 340 million...So despite being obviously unconstitutional, the thought experiment of banning blacks from owning guns does net you a HUGE reduction in the gun murder rate.Edit: I should have said ""close to 40%"" above instead of 50%."
dw9l2xi,T3hoofs,"My money is on that not being the case. If anything banning guns from one race of people will allow for even more crime. And race based violence would sky rocket. How and by whom...you ask? White men. White men knowing that black people can't own guns would attempt to kill, rape molest and etc..every last black person in america. So no..it wouldn't net you a HUGE reduction in the gun murder rate. It would raise it a million fold. Remember slavery? Remember how black people ended up where they are to begin with? It was because white men had power, guns and people automatically believed everything they said. I have to say though. Good deflection from mass/school shootings and the need for gun control there. Hope your family get's caught up in one. :)"
dw9u49g,the_blur,"I did the math a while back. The numbers are what they are regardless of what you put your money on. Sources are at the bottom.Population total in the United States in 2014 (latest year for which we also have crime statistics): 318,907,401.Of that 318 907 401, 42 167 490 identified as Black or African American. Representing about 13.222% of the total population. This large group of 42,167,490 individuals produced approximately 5,173 murderers in 2014.The total of non-black Americans is:246,644,353 - White3,958,190 - American Indian and Alaska Native17,397,628 - Asian742,821 - Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander7,996,919 - Two or more races 276,739,911 - TOTAL (Total murder rate for this slice of the population: 13,897 - 5,173 = 8,724)Going by these numbers from the Census Bureau and the FBI, this means that this ethnic group which represents 13.222% of the population for the United States, is committing 36.9% of the total murders in the country. ===POPULATION / KILLERS = POPULATION FOR 1 KILLER276,739,911 / 8,724 = 31,721 GEN POP246,644,353 / 4,367 = 56,479 ISOLATED WHITE POP 54,000,000*/ 1,264 = 42,721 ISOLATED LATINO POP 42,167,490 / 5,173 = 8,151 ISOLATED BLACK POP *Inaccurate, sourced from google search for ""US Hispanic Population 2014""===In the non black population, you can go 31,721 people on average before you encounter a murderer. In the black community, that number goes down to 8,151. That means that any random member of the black community in aggregate is almost 4 times more likely (31,721 / 8,151 = ~3.89) to murder you than any other ethnicity in aggregate.===Sources:United States Census BureauCensus 2014 datahttp://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=bkmkRetrieved 20160707Uniform Crime Reports2014 Crime in the United StatesExpanded Homicide Data Table 3https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_3_murder_offenders_by_age_sex_and_race_2014.xlsRetrieved 20160707Uniform Crime Reports2014 Crime in the United StatesExpanded Homicide Data Table 6https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2014.xlsRetrieved 20160707"

dvwpkm9,Fiending4Krokodil,"Mental health is a problem everywhere, but America doesn't do nearly enough to address the problem. I know that within the military, veterans aren't getting the quality of mental health care that they need, thanks to the bureaucratic mess that is the VA. Outside of the military, a lot of people just can't afford therapy and self-medicate with drugs that pharmaceutical companies are only too happy to provide."
dvwq3pm,BawsDaddy,"No one is saying that mental health facilities shouldn't be improved. What people are saying though is you will not fix the problem unless you address easy gun access. Both should definitely be invested in, but regulating gun access must take precedence."
dvwqsoy,tstrimple,"Is there any evidence to support the implicit assertion that mental health care is better in literally every other developed country? Is mental health support really better in Japan for instance? They have a massive suicide problem, which indicates they aren't having much success battling mental illness either. Why aren't there a bunch of mass murders and school shootings in Japan?"
dvwvadj,welshwelsh,">Why aren't there a bunch of mass murders and school shootings in Japan?Because the mentally ill tend to be older in Japan. The suicide rate for people younger than 19 is 10% of the rate for ages 50-59. Children in Japan get a lot of trust and autonomy. You can see, for example, 5-year-olds taking the train into the city all by themselves. In the US, children, boys specifically, are treated like braindead zombie-criminals, assumed to have the poorest of judgment and the worst of intentions. They need to be carefully supervised and strictly disciplined, else they might get themselves killed or do something bad (like, say, shoot up the school). It is well established that a low sense of control is a precursor to many mental health issues. It's not at all surprising that an American boy might feel like he has no control over his life, and might try to regain that control by taking someone else's."
dvwsdu0,Saxit,"Using Japan as a statistical source for suicide and murder is not without flaws.It's a country where the police ""solves"" almost 100% of their crime, including murder, because you know, if a perp isn't found, then obviously it must have been suicide."
dvwrfzw,zenchowdah,"With the legalization of illicit drugs in Portugal, I imagine mental health isn't great there either"
dvwvsdi,welshwelsh,"It's actually pretty good in Portugal. Heroin use has been at a steady decline ever since it got decriminalized. Drugs do not cause mental health issues. They are just a symptom. For example, look at Vietnam war vets- most of them were hooked when they were on the front lines, but had no trouble stopping once they returned to their friends and families. Only people in pain use painkillers."
dvwvy66,zenchowdah,"Yeah, I figured there was something in place to treat addiction properly. I remember it happening near the last recession, so I figured it hadn't been implemented yet. Thanks for setting me straight.On the other hand, someone with mental health issues that turns to drugs could be in a world of trouble."
dvxzch8,filmantopia,"8% of gun homicides in the US are by the mentally ill. So I would agree that getting better assistance for the mentally ill would definitely help, as it could potentially resolve up to 8% of the problem."

dw91xlv,jaxcs,"Not healthy, not desirable, not welcome. None of these means that the killer is mentally ill. If you are serious about this kind of definition, then no one who wants to kill should ever be sent to prison, because their illness precludes punishment."

dvx5puu,comeherebob,"Gun control advocates do. People often complain about suicides being included in stats on violent gun use, but violence against oneself is still violence. No person who's endured a friend or loved one taking their own life is going to be like, ""Well, they didn't hurt anyone else, so in the end I'm glad that they had access to a machine that made it infinitely easier and more effective to make an irreversible decision in a moment of weakness and despair."""

dvyyend,I_Fart_Liquids,"> The study was conducted among persons who attempted suicide by various methods and were admitted to hospital. The study population comprised 147 participants (33 males and 114 females) aged between 14 and 33 years.While those numbers do seem high enough to test an idea, I would like to see a poll with maybe a little more people and a more equal ratio of men to women. If the people who were used in the study were taken from somewhere other than the random populous (like say from a doctor who requested patients with a history of suicidal tendencies to take this—where men would be less likely to go than women after an unsuccessful attempt) than the results could also be skewed. I'm not saying they 100% are but I might look for a second opinion on this topic"

dvx6igo,comeherebob,"Wow this one touched a nerve. I can't tell if it's because redditors are interpreting this article as an argument against gun control measures or if it's because the headline suggests a problem that is exclusive to men. Either way, I don't see how this is controversial. The US experiences disproportionately high rates of gun violence. Gun violence is disproportionately perpetrated by men (and men are also disproportionately the victims of it). We can work toward evidence-based restrictions on gun ownership while also discussing how to help American men. The latter issue is something that affects a multitude of other problems (and is a problem in itself!), so I don't see the benefit in *not* approaching the topic in a logical yet compassionate way. I'm female and have spent copious amounts of time on male-dominated internet communities and I can say with confidence that a lot y'all have some issues, and I don't mean that in a cruel or judgmental way. There just seem to be an endless well of depression, anxiety, and social isolation felt by a lot of guys out there, especially young ones. Addressing it might be part of the puzzle to solving issues like gun violence, but it could simultaneously go a long way toward helping the majority - i.e., guys who are struggling would never hurt someone else. It's a win-win."

dvwp8cp,Katsutomai,Let's be fair here: You have to imagine that without guns a lot of these deaths wouldn't have happened. More than a few of these people wouldn't have had the guts to try anything without a gun. So in effect the gun enabled the idiocy.
dvygohw,betaking12,"While that might be true in some circumstances, I'm not certain guns are the sole factor. Many would still die due to the underlying actions/motivations involved, be it gangsters stabbing each other, or a suicidal person resorting to hanging. Add to it the general opportunity costs with regards to things like political capital, and furthering a culture-war narrative."
dvx1b8d,ViskerRatio,"I dislike this sort of conflation of 'mental health' with 'lack of socialization'.We're not talking about people with brain damage or objectively characterizable conditions like schizophrenia here. We're talking about people whose primary damage is entirely a lack of social inclusion.This is an uncomfortable truth that people really don't want to address because of what it implies: the problem isn't them, it's us.Nor is trying to rid ourselves of 'toxic masculinity' a solution - it's actually part of the *problem*. The unwillingness to engage with the reality of how young men think and feel just means that you hasten the social exclusion that creates the problem.Nor are mental health professionals a panacea. Mental health professionals cannot provide the day-by-day, moment-by-moment social structure these young men need. Spending an hour with your therapist before being tossed out again on the streets doesn't fix what is, fundamentally, not a mental health but a *social* health problem.These young men need families and communities, not professionals."
