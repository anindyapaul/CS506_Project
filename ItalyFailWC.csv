dps3eg7,polerize,The strategy of scoring almost no goals didn't work
dps6wuq,A_Bit_Of_Nonsense,*almost*?
dpsigel,ChunkyDay,almost.
dpsvqrd,chopyhop,"People shouldn't be angry with the Italian team. There was a long time where many countries did not have serious football teams, that's simply not the case any more. There are few free wins, and throughout the last few qualifications it became harder for the big teams to qualify across the board."
dpsza6l,yarnoshke,They were never qualified to begin with.
dpwb2zd,FerryAce,"The Italy national team in Euro 2016 is awesome. Was under Antonio Conte then. Great defence, unity and exciting attacking team as well. Going to miss them badly in the 2018 World Cup."
dpsmzq5,grine,Seems to have worked better than Italy's plan of scoring no goals at all.
dpsynuq,FerryAce,"This is sad news. They were always one of those teams I look forward to watching. Was always an interesting team no matter how badly they did in the qualifier, they always does better in the main tournament. Italy will be missed. They have a failed manager. Forza Italia."
dpssc5i,TBNecksnapper,"Sweden followed the same strategy, worked for them!"
dpt3rd7,batboy963,8 - 0 baby. Top that!
dpsu9bg,GerryAdams32,Tell that to Ireland
dpsvcvu,cardboardunderwear,I thought all of soccer was almost no goals.
dpsz25p,1992_,I can't believe this is a thing. How soccer is so popular is beyond me.
dpt5b6r,JustFoundItDudePT,Football you mean. How the word soccer is so popular is beyond me.
dpt79dr,rhaegar_tldragon,Soccer is a British word and was used in England until about 30 years ago.
dptdeyi,TooLazytoCreateUser,"Some nations, like Ireland Australia and the USA, have different forms of football besides association football. In order to avoid confusion they use the name soccer."
dptac4m,-dsh,That what is a thing? Italy tried to score but they didn't manage to.

dpvntvz,WikiTextBot,"**Catenaccio**Catenaccio (Italian pronunciation: [kateˈnattʃo]) or The Chain is a tactical system in football with a strong emphasis on defence. In Italian, catenaccio means ""door-bolt"", which implies a highly organised and effective backline defence focused on nullifying opponents' attacks and preventing goal-scoring opportunities.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/sports/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"
dpvnxu5,-dsh,I know what catenaccio is but this wasn't about catenaccio. Op said that Italy wasn't trying to score goals and he asked how that's a thing although Italy actually tried to score.
dpt6ztk,polerize,I don't know. Those 0-0 ties So thrilling! The beautiful game!
dpt121x,Ermellino,"Soccer so simple, everyone can watch it and understand, but I also think it's bad, and almost every action consists of throwing the ball in front of the net and hope your comrade runs faster than the other... And it seems that they kick the ball randomly: there's no difference between a teen that does it as a hobby and a pro, considering precision. Failing a penality kick by missing the net, where the keeper just guesses and jumps randomly is proof of that..."
dpt4u44,Remli_7,Can't tell if you're being sarcastic or watch too much MLS.
dpt7txk,new_number_one,I disagree with 100% of what you're saying but your criticism is hilarious.
dprvkby,peanuts_for_sale,Who would have guessed. Iceland in. Italy and the Netherlands out.
dps3ew4,RumblesUbambaa,And Sweden knocked out both Italy and the Netherlands!
dps5zhf,,Damn.. Scandinavia coming in strong
dps613v,Willof,"Iceland isn't part of Scandinavia. Edit: Except when it is. Edit2: Sweden, Denmark and Norway are officially Scandinavia. Sweden and Norway though are the only countries on the Scandinavian Peninsula.

dpsao99,erixtyminutes,"As fas as I know it's just Finland, but I wouldn't surprised if there were others.

dpsh56z,lind_p,Some city in Germany doesn't exist as well. I can't remember the name unfortunately. Not worth remembering names for fictional cities anyway.Edit: had to google it. Bielefeld doesn't exist.

dpsve1s,melonkernel,"Finland was the eastern part of Sweden longer than Skåne has belonged to Sweden... then Russia took it and we became an autonomous duchy in the Russian empire. Then a hundred years ago we declared our independence and became this awesome country of our own. We are not scandinavia, but part of ”the Northern countries” together with Iceland, Denmark (and yes Greenland & Faroe Island since they belong to Denmark), Norway and Sweden.

dps9e87,Elvysaur,"Geographically yes, in every other way, no"
dps9j0o,Willof,"I'm confused, is Finland different to Sweden in every other way compared to Iceland?"
dpsbkbs,Elvysaur,"Iceland is basically an offshoot of Norway/Denmark from 1000 years ago. Finland is a totally different culture, language family, etc. So yes, Iceland is much more ""Scandinavian"" than Finland in every way save geographic distance"
dpsbnve,Willof,Well language certainly but I'd take heed to call finnish and swedish culture totally different.
dpslm00,pewpew69weed,"Finland is a Nordic country, along with Denmark and all the other mentioned counties. They do follow the Scandinavian model (social democracy, think Bernie but actually sound economically). But you're right, their most common language has a remote relation to Hungarian, and nothing else. However, most of them do speak Swedish. This one can see that on many levels they are Scandinavian. Cultural aspects such as food howver, have more in common with Russian culture.Source: Norwegian who was on a cultural exchange in esbo/Helsinki."
dptllw0,Rodec,[Super cool video about it.](https://youtu.be/TsXMe8H6iyc)GCP GREY
dps6wvo,Trumpstered,"Wikipedia.orgThe term Scandinavia always includes the three kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The remote Norwegian islands of Svalbard and Jan Mayen are usually not seen as a part of Scandinavia, nor is Greenland, a constituent country within the Kingdom of Denmark. However, the Faroe Islands, also a Danish constituent country, are sometimes included, as sometimes are Iceland, Finland, and the Finnish autonomous region of the Åland Islands, because of their historical association with the Scandinavian countries and the Scandinavian peoples and languages."
dpsacuj,jansencheng,"Use the Nordic Countries, that unambiguously includes everybody you'd associate with it."
dpsbh63,Kalapakki,"Friendly reminder everyone, do not accidentally associate Estonia with Nordic. :)"
dpsbit7,jansencheng,"They are on the Nordic Council, though. 🤔"
dpsjyxr,pref-top,Estonia isn't on the nordic council. They are are an observative member.
dpsfud2,lgb_br,"Just say: ""Those countries in and around that peninsula that is shaped like a dick"". (I know, Peninsula comes from Penis, it's basic Latin)."
dpsm4kl,FallOnSlough,"For anyone who wonders whether the above stated etymology is true - it is not. Peninsula comes from the latin words for 'almost' (paene) and 'island' (insula). Same 'pen-' as in penultimate.But that's the boring truth. I like the penis version better, so I'll stick with that explanation in the future."
dpssgb7,lgb_br,"Dang Latin nerds, lemme troll Reddit alone! Hahaha, fair play. It's completely bollocks, but it's a way funnier explanation."

dpsl6mj,MartinBlank73,"Except you know realistically Scotland Ireland England and the ne Her land and Germany can fit in that too, and the baltics at times.Acting like there is one best word for something like this is typically folly, and definitely folly here."
dpsvf9o,plomerosKTBFFH,"They can? I've NEVER heard anyone referring to Scotland, Ireland, England or Germany as part of the Nordic countries. That is reserved for Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland & co.I mean sure you can be super-technical and say ""But they are in the northern part of Europe"", but with that reasoning you could also count Bulgaria or Romania to Southern Europe but nobody does that. The Nordics is a term unequivocally used to refer to the Scandinavian (you know which one's I mean ;) ) countries."
dpt8olh,MartinBlank73,"Well you should read some more history and ethnography then. Certainly those countries are lumped in depending on what lense you are using.>unequivocallyyou used this word, but I don't think you know what it means."
dptawjx,plomerosKTBFFH,"Please provide me with an example of that ""lense"" then, cause like I said I've never heard of anyone counting Germany or Ireland as part of the Nordics. Even googling ""The Nordics"" or ""Nordic countries"" provides you with maps and descriptions of the area spanning Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Iceland, nothing else.HOWEVER. If you google ""Northern Europe"", England, Germany, Ireland etc. are included. Could this be what you were referring to? Northern Europe and not Nordic countries?You're probably right about unequivocally, English is my second language so I'm sure I've misunderstood a few words here and there."
dptciyr,MartinBlank73,"Well one of the ones I already mentioned, ethnographically. England Scotland and Ireland saw extensive Nordic settlement, such that much of England was ruled under Danish law for a time. Dublin is a Nordic town. There are many others."
dptcy49,plomerosKTBFFH,"So what you're saying is that parts of Ukraine and maybe even Russia can be considered Nordic too, with our viking settlements in Ukraine and the Nestor chronicles description of the foundation of the Kingdom of Rus, eventually followed by the Russian Empire.This is some next-level technicality, really."
dptd0n8,MartinBlank73,"Ummm no, it is pointing out that the word means different things in different contexts. I am sorry you don't read more."
dptdo0o,plomerosKTBFFH,"And I'm sorry that you feel that there might be some etnographer out there who will be super-confused when someone mentions the Nordic countries.But the thing is they won't be. Like everyone else they'll know exactly what countries they mean. The poster you replied to suggested this term as anyone will know what countries are covered by it. You felt that was not the case, but it is. Unless you might find yourself at an ethnographic conference where there is no room for simple terms, but that is a pretty uncommon occurence."

dpsshme,Uebeltank,Actually you could consider Finland and Iceland to be part of Scandinavia as Finland was part of Sweden (until early 1800s) and Iceland was part of Norway (until 1814) and Denmark (1814-1918).

dpsc4ve,,Well Iceland didn't declare independence from Denmark until 1944. Personally... I'll give it to them. Their ancestors literally floated away from Scandinavia and settled there. The Faroes are part of Denmark so they are Scandinavian.

dpsjyeq,postcardigans,"IIRC, in the early 1900s Iceland was still very rural, and Reykjavik was essentially a small fishing village. Even into the previous century, it could have been described as medieval."
dpsmk3s,Conclamatus,"Well... Iceland was occupied by US forces in 1941, after a pre-emptive British invasion to keep the Germans out, and ultimately the people of Iceland didn't want to be returned to Danish control once Denmark's occupation by Germany was over. So this independence was facilitated and Denmark was never in much position to protest if they wanted to.

dpsicsz,capincus,Eh it would be like the US constantly losing in football if every other country in the world was huge into football. It's not like England is the only country that cares about soccer outside the World Cup.
dps30ug,LoveandBonor,Big deal to me :(
dps5j40,evilpartiesgetitdone,It's a very big deal for many of us here. It's a real punch in the gut after watching us develop into a real competitor over the last 20+ years

dps6d6g,HHcougar,"The US not making the World Cup was actually a very big surprise, US soccer was supposed to be on the upswing, and several catastrophic failures were required for the US to get shut out.Granted, Italy, Chile, and the Netherlands are even more surprising. This is going to be a very interesting world cup"
dps6w3q,Obandigo,Germany will just decimate again. They have lost some key figures but they still are a solid team.
dpsafiz,CGFROSTY,US not making the Word Cup is still a surprise.
dpsjfko,unicornlord,I love how euros thought it was a huge deal to the US because TV stations fought over the rights to the world cup.
dpsrhyb,nochillchazza,"Yeah nobody calls europeans euros, that's a currency"
dps4lbx,Willof,And Sweden was the one responsible for knocking out both Italy and the Netherlands.
dps8xr1,DelusionalSocialist,"I'd say the Netherlands is responsible for knocking out the Netherlands. We actually beat Sweden in Amsterdam, and tied them in Stockholm. (We even got the 2-1 denied by the ref in the last minute, would have been two victories otherwise)Our qualification run was less than impressive. But not due to Sweden."
dpsc6bo,DTGG,"As a French guy I feel bad for the Netherlands, always loved their teams from my childhood. We lost to Sweden because of that stupid Lloris mistake in the final seconds of the match and it pretty much cost you the qualification at that stage. Sure it's not our fault that you didn't make it, but that was such an easy mistake to avoid by Lloris."
dpsp3cn,ThePr1d3,So thanks to this mistake Italy got knocked out. Lloris with the long con French revenge <3
dpsbtr4,swiper33,"Well, you only beat us the last game because it was already decided by then. It would have been much harder if we had something to play for (other than not losing by 7 goals)."
dpscxv5,DelusionalSocialist,"Fair point. The only thing you really had to play for was not getting too much injuries and yellows, but the not conceding 7 goals thing was basically a given. On the other hand, the only thing the Netherlands realistically had to play for was one final hurray. Arjen Robben already said before the game that we should be honest and say that it's not going to happen. But we (or they) had the obligation to try, to show to the public that they still have some fire in them. The final game for the Netherlands was actually more about restoring honour then about winning by 7 goals. That was never going to happen.But I do agree that we shouldn't count this final game. If we both had something to play for then it would be a very different game. I think it's not unfair to say that in the first game the Netherlands was the better party. But this was also the best game of the Netherlands in the qualifiers while it was the worst game by Sweden. The Netherlands got worse throughout the tournament while Sweden got better. That's what some old Swedish international said anyway in some news article. At this final stage of the tournament Sweden played better than the Netherlands did. It is not unreasonable to think that we would have lost if both parties had something to fight for.If we look throughout the entire qualifiers, Sweden clearly deserved the spot more than the Netherlands. But that's something that I never denied. I actually live in Sweden right now, so I'm very content with the WC ticket. Unfortunately I'll be in the Netherlands during the WC itself, but I will be cheering for Sweden."
dps97me,Willof,"It's true, we didn't exclusively knock you out. Sorry, I got carried away by the marginal win against Italy."
dps9n5h,DelusionalSocialist,"To give credit where credit's due, Sweden's run still was impressive. Especially with Zlatan gone, lots of people didn't think they could do it. The Netherlands may not be at top form at the moment, in my view they're still about an equal match to Sweden right now. (Which showed during the two head-to-head games). Getting even a play-off spot was far from a gaurantee.This was probably the thoughest group around facing both France and the Netherlands. Before the qualifiers started Sweden was probably underdog with respect to both teams (despite the Dutch performance last years), and then they faced Italy in the play-offs, a team that has not faced elimination in 60 years.The WC ticket is more than deserved. As a matter of fact, I actually live in Sweden at the moment so I've been cheering for the country as well. The tragic thing is that I'm visiting the Netherlands during the world cup though.**Edit:** Forgot about Bulgaria. While not world-class, it's not the easiest opponent in this tier either. France, The Netherlands, Sweden and Bulgaria in the same group is really an unlucky draw for all of these teams."
dpsa6lp,Willof,"In all honesty, you're probably right, I think we just faced teams that weren't at their best.It's an absurd thought that, with the loss of one of our best forwards ever in history and a veteran goalkeeper AND with a new head coach, we would advance to the world cup. Yet somehow we did."
dpsaklh,DelusionalSocialist,"I mean the only team that was really out of form was the Netherlands. And you got only 1 point against the Netherlands, so it's not like you really exploited the weak position of the Netherlands you had to get your points against countries that *were* in form. You don't survive this group and then beat Italy just because of luck.Same with many Dutch people complaining how unlucky we were in our run (denied 2-1 against Sweden away and also Sweden beating France). If you miss two major tournaments in a row it's not bad luck anymore. It's not one game that we blew, it's a total of 20 at this moment (Euro+WC), at that point it's not a fluke anymore.It was an impressive run from Sweden. And I for one am very happy that Sweden advanced. I was rooting for the Netherlands, but Sweden is my #2 in this WC. (Again, I live in Linköping these days not in the Netherlands)"
dpwh8m9,eljne,What happened when both Zlatan and the coach quit was that the team had to change strategy. Instead of building the attacking on pretty much one player they began to focuse on the team as a whole. Z might also have been a too big star to handle for everyone in the Sweden national team.
dpsfmf0,dabbo93,Sneaky swedes

dpsbffs,Gamecubed,"Not a shock, but it's still impressive since this is their first time making it after years of being horrible."

dpsebzp,Coyrex1,"Oh my god Neatherlands and Italy are both out? That's actually crazy to me considering those are generally considered top 10 countries, and damn Neatherlands is a legit contender to win these last couple times."
dps5k1b,srsbsns,What a time to be alive!
dpsatzs,tek9knaller,"NL just has awful players though. It's not that surprising. Italy has plenty of world class players, they should've made it."
dpsdvpw,ReversalRivers,Netherlands not making it isn't surprising if you've seen them since the last world cup.
dps84xw,Hagibest,"Iceland, Panama, Morocco, and Tunisia made it, while Italy, Netherlands, USA, Chile, Ecuador, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Algeria, Cameroon, Ukraine, Turkey, Greece, Czech Republic, Bosnia, Romania (even if they haven't been in awhile, usually come close and have good talents), Wales, one of Denmark or Ireland all miss out.It's going to be a weird World Cup"
dps6ji0,IMFINISHED,"How do they determine which teams play each other in order to qualify? For example, does the United States only play teams in the Americas while Italy and the Netherlands only play teams in Europe?I was wondering how the hell Saudi Arabia qualified while the Netherlands, Italy, and the United statues all failed to. If what I surmised above is correct than I guess it's not that surprising."
dpsa065,StuffSpurs,"Yeah they work out how many places go to each continent, and then each confederation will have its own qualifying. So Asia gets four automatic spots, and one interconfederational play-off spot. Europe gets I think 13 spots."
dps6xkw,HerraIAJ,"yeah there are inner group stages with multiple groups for each continent, so europe has some groups and the top teams from there go on to the cup. the same goes for other continents"
dptdkx3,pm_8_me,"The USA played in the CONCACAF, including North and Central American countries. It is widely considered the easiest way to qualify."

dpscizh,coldbeercoldbeer,I don't understand how your entire squad can consist of so many players from the top 5 European teams and be that bad. Americans would be clamoring for a World Cup if we had one player in Pulisic who turns out to be half as good as somebody like di Maria.
dpsfcqu,izcaranax,"di Maria would be amazing if he understands the concept of ""GIVING THE FUCKING BALL BACK TO MESSI"".1st goal against Ecuador in the last Qualifying game. That's what di Maria has to do. That's what Argentines have been expecting him to do all this time."

dpsgliz,NotTheBomber,Doesn't most of the nation of Argentina have Italian ancestry?
dpshstm,izcaranax,Something between 62% and 68% have at least one Italian ancestor. In my case my father is Italian.
dpt7y16,Sylbinor,And you speak spanish.:(
dptp4jg,izcaranax,"That's because Italy didn't colonize us and the Italians that came here were mostly poor uneducated workers who didn't speak Standard Italian well and spoke mostly their regional dialects. Then lots of them were educated in Argentine schools in Spanish. That was the case of my grandparents.At the beginning most of them spoke a Italian-Spanish pidgin called ""Cocoliche"". And there was also ""Lunfardo"", an Spanish dialect spoken mostly in Buenos Aires and Montevideo in the lower classes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Lunfardo is known mostly for Tango lyrics). Nowadays you have the Rioplatense Spanish, a dialect spoken in Buenos Aires and Uruguay, it's the famous dialect asociated with Argentines. It has intonation patterns similar to Italian and A LOT of slang derived from Italian. Of course, as a ""porteño"", I speak this dialect of Spanish and when I talk with Spanish speakers from other countries I have to ""neutralize"" my Spanish to be understood.Finally, lots of Argentineans learnt Italian (something like 1,5 M, 3,4% of the population) but not because they use it on a daily basis. It's just because it's a beautiful language and I'm an Italian citizen too, so I felt I have to know Italian."

dpt9ei3,MirandaCoyne,Interesting take.
dpt9p7w,pgm123,"Though, admittedly, I don't think most people from the U.S. care about Mexico. It always seem like El Tri fans are the ones to be incredibly happy about beating the U.S.Maybe it's closer to a Yankees fan rooting for the Orioles? Or Blue Jays?"

He also had to celebrate his victory under the International Judo Federation's flag, because the emirate banned the display of Israeli symbols.""It's honestly just appalling that sports, which is supposed to represent people's ability to come together and compete one against another in the spirit of the old Greek Olympics when war was put on hold and hostilities put aside, sees such behavior with no repercussions."

Excluding like 3 nations(I think it was Indonesia, Cuba and Tahiti), Israel is the country with the longest streak of not making it to the qualifying round(Last time was in 1970). Though it sure would be hell of a shitshow, as you said, to see us qualifying for the first time in 50 years just to spite people who don't understand sports represent a bridge between nations and cultures rather than a platform to express your hate.

dpseov5,zdelusion,"I get the point you're trying to make. We'd probably launch a national inquiry like we did when we didn't win Gold in '06.It's possible, but would take a lot more then just sucking at one qualifier. The way Olympic hockey qualifiers work Canada would have to be absolute ass at tournaments for several years leading up to them. Currently Canada doesn't even bother sending close to its tier A rosters to the World Championship because it doesn't really matter and we're so comfortably qualified for everything. [IIHF standings for the curious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIHF_World_Ranking)"
dpsou01,WaffleboardedAway,I don't think you get the point he's trying to make. Canadas best players aren't going to the olympics this year and they have to send players who mostly play in Europe. The outrage is... well pretty mild to be honest eh?
dpsth53,inbruges99,"Speak for yourself, I'm fucking pissed at those greedy fuckers ruining hockey (Bettman and the like).

dpt70hi,ElTechnoBanana,"That's a bad comparison, players aren't assigned to NHL teams based on their nationality. Up until 2015, more than half of all NHL players were Canadian, which is pretty insane when you consider that Canada has a tenth of the population of the US."

dpsb34d,skinte1,It is a big thing. At least when Canada wins... And since NHL players can play as long as their team is out of the playoffs around 75% of the players are available in may.
dpsh1t4,TardisTechnologist,"World juniors is a big deal but Canada not qualifying is out of the question. Soccer is far more international than hockey, there's many more teams and a greater spectrum. The big hockey countries dominate the small ones.The NHL's ""World Cup of Hockey"" is just put on as an extra money grab for the NHL, I enjoyed it last year but it's not like teams had to qualify. They essentially just made up the teams put of NHL players however they wanted and said ""go play hockey""."

dps3azq,usscan,Lol. The hockey world cup is largely a joke. Even tiny hockey nations are in and it's played every single year and lots of the best players are not participating because it's during the NHL playoffs.
dps48md,canuck5551,You're thinking of the World Championships. The World Cup is the NHL-run tournament that was held last September and 2004 and 1996 before that.
dps4p25,usscan,You are right indeed. I was thinking of the World Championships.
dps524d,ClubberLain,"To be fair the world cup is a joke as well. The only tournament that really matters in international hockey is the Olympics, but the greed from IOC stopped that."
dps5gca,Torcal4,It's a mix of a lot of factors. I wouldn't blame any one camp for the NHL not being there.
dps5pkz,ClubberLain,I don't agree. The thing is the NHL just want fair compensation for letting their players go to play a highly competative tournament just two months before playoffs. But the IOC refuses and wants to eat the cake and keep it as well.
dps677b,Torcal4,"I'm sorry but that's wrong. Saying the NHL ""just"" wants fair compensation is wrong.The owners of NHL teams don't want their players to go to the Olympics.1) the two weeks it takes away from the NHL, force the schedules to be condensed. It also pushes the NHL playoffs deeper into the MLB season. They don't want to compete with the NBA and MLB more than they already have to.2) Sending players to the Olympics has the potential to injure them. Players on the Olympics tend to be the best players on NHL teams. So to lose them for any amount of time is horrible to an NHL team.3) The Olympics don't bring that many new viewers to the NHL. The difference is negligible. The NHL seems slower post-Olympics so it really slows down their ratings.You don't have to agree. But these are the reasons the owners don't want players to go. It's the same reason that when people blame Bettman for not sending players there. It's not his decision. The owners voted against it. The NHL said no to the Olympics before the IOC and IIHF did."
dps6thv,burgerblaster,Why would it seem slower than Olympic hockey? International ice dimensions have always made it slower than NHL hockey. The rest of your comment makes perfect sense to me.
dps74hn,Torcal4,"Olympic hockey is a lot more offensive than the NHL. Also you're talking about the best players in the world playing together. It's gonna be a lot faster paced because there's a lot more skill involved.Don't get me wrong, I love the NHL and the players there are also the best in the world. But there's a much bigger filtration of talent at the olympics which makes for much more exciting hockey."
dps714l,2Pac_Okur,"if the NHL were competently run, they would leverage it into massive numbers of viewers."
dps8h2w,therevengeance,"How? The IOC doesn't let them use anything Olympics to advertise, it's one of the things they asked for and the IOC ejected."
dpsaia7,mtaw,"Yeah, it's hard to argue it's not in their economic self interest. Which is why they shouldn't get a choice. They need to be forced to release the players. Private business interests shouldn't determine if players get to represent their countries in major tournaments. Its what the players want, its what the people want. Fuck the club owners."
dpsamfz,Torcal4,"But that's like saying ""my boss doesn't get to tell me that I can't take time off"". They're the employees and the owners are their bosses. It's a business. Unfortunately, that's how it works."
dps7uyu,Beard-,The world juniors are pretty popular too.
dpsae65,Smauler,The football (soccer) world cup was a bit of a joke when it started too. Only 4 European national sides competed in the first one.Uruguay has won one 1 world cup less than all of Europe combined (excluding Germany and Italy).
dps483j,WarrenPuff_It,Salty.
dps4k1m,NormGreen,He was thinking of the World Championships but he's not wrong. In the 2014 Olympics (much more like the FIFA World Cup is to the football/soccer world) Canada had almost no competition for the gold medal in hockey because all of its best players could actually go instead of being in the NHL playoffs.
dps45pb,HubbaMaBubba,"Nobody gives a shit about the world Cup of hockey. The Olympics were the main thing, but Bettman fucked that up."
dps520k,UncleGriswold,"> Nobody gives a shit about the world Cup of hockey.Right.Come to Canada and tell that to the thousands of Canadians who gather at 7 am to watch a world cup game airing from Europe.If you survive, please let us know how it goes."

dps2gtl,karltk,"No, like the world cup of hockey is literally run by the NHL and they would never not have a team Canada. In 2016, there were two teams for Canadians to play on"
dps57de,,[deleted]
dps5li3,karltk,"It's 100% bullshit, I think it's a product of nearly all of the top talent in the world being in one league (including many of the best European players). The world championships (done by iihf) take place during the NHL playoffs, so most of the best players are unavailable for that. Now they aren't going to the Olympics either. I just want high level international competition 😢"
dps4fyy,hoss292,Team North America was the best part of the tournament by far.
dpsd1oa,Andkcojskaosncicoanw,"I bet no one would notice as long as the NHL continued. Apparently there is a world championship of hockey, but no one has even seen it."

dps5dk7,GarMc,No. They don't. It's pathetic.
dps9cfk,pokemonmaster4,"It's a different system. If you don't qualify for the top tournament, you play the next division down as opposed to staying home."
dps9ing,GarMc,"There was no qualifications for the tournament last year. Only six countries participated, and two made up teams (Team Europe and Team North America) played in it."
dps9u7t,pokemonmaster4,"That was the NHL's world cup of hockey, which was a joke, but there's a real international competition, the IIHF world championship, but it occurs in May, during the NHL conference finals."
dpsa950,GarMc,"Right, we we're talking about the World Cup of Hockey. I have no problem with the World Championship, except that it happens every year. And now that NHL wants their stupid tournament the World Championship will lose value."
dpsb0y5,Szymonmf,No it won't because Europeans actually care about the world championships. Look at the massive celebration in Stockholm when Sweden won this year and how few Canadians cared when we won the past two or three years.
dpsb6g2,GarMc,"I really wish hockey was more like soccer, as in the IIHF actually had control over leagues like the NHL and wouldn't allow them to simply make their own world tournament. I try to support my local junior teams (Mooseheads and Screaming Eagles) as much as I can, but I can't get very involved with how the whole sport operates in comparison to European sports. Hopefully the forthcoming Canadian Premier League emulates Europe more than North America."
dpsdfen,Szymonmf,I don't. The IIHF can kindly go fuck themselves. They've done a horrible job of growing the game. And sure the world cup of hockey was a quick cash grab designed to appease players who want to go to the Olympics but it was fun and team N.A was extremely likeable.
dps5iet,UncleGriswold,"Sure they do. They send the teams to your mom's house, they run a train on her and she qualifies them.Heavy shit."

dps7p25,feanarosurion,"Ironically, I'd say it's more like Sweden not qualifying for the world cup of hockey. I'd call Canada the Brazil or Germany of hockey. Italy in football is more like... Sweden."
dps9idj,pokemonmaster4,"FIFA ranks Italy at 15th, the IIHF ranks Slovenia 15th, although the FIFA world cup has 32 teams and the world cup of hockey 16, so a better comparison would be the 7th and 8th ranked hockey teams, Germany and Switzerland."

dpsgqbq,ThatBrandon,You must be fun at parties
dpt641d,Thot_Crusher,[Copypasta comment]
dps3vtl,repeat_with_dora,"Yeah, it is a common say now:""Every day a different 7x1"""
dps6iba,ernbeld,It ... really? Don't know if you're joking or if this is for real!
dps6ybr,Yossarian-,"Yup, he's not lying. It has become a very common saying used whenever we're complaining about getting fucked by the government and being a brazilian in general."
dps7ill,nysn0,Being Brazilian is pain... Todo minuto um 7x1 diferente
dps9m0k,fodafoda,Goooool da Alemanha
dpt0n91,apathetic_revolution,"Is the ""x"" in 7x1 ""por"" ""a"" ""o""? My portuguese is really basic. I only took a semester of it over a decade ago."

dps8jj2,buffy1992,"Being in Brazil is pain, what a hell hole."

dpsm2kh,no2K7,"Only bad thing about Brazil is the government and the violence in some states, other than that made me realize I'll never move back to America again."
dptlv1t,JaktheJoker,Wow as a german im kinda sorry for winning now
dps8yc4,RapaduraGalactica,Yeah. We actualy joke about it more than anyone.Became a huge meme over here.
dpspmv1,ThePr1d3,Tbf when you got THAT screwed you can't be mad against the referee or find excuses so better embrace it and meme
dps8jaa,DanteStrauss,"Yes. It is. We usually say it when things keep getting screwed on top of what we thought was already screwed... well... kinda like that game actually...""*It is over?*- It ain't.*Now?*- Not really, here's one more..*Ok, now we are done, right?*- Sure... Oh, who am I kidding of course not....""and so on..."
dpsqt13,Poponildo,"It is, but in a light hearted and funny way. We Brazilians like to make fun of ourselves, we are not mad at Germany or whatever."
dpslawg,Iyion,I heard that in Brazilian Portuguese something that translates as “7-1“ is now used colloquially as an equivalent to “fuck“ - is that true?
dptdylb,pm_8_me,"No, it isn't. Source: Me"
dptgh1i,IamSoGreedy,"Not very true, but we use it daily. When we see a huge loss for our country, like something that politicians makes against the population, we say: ""another 7x1 / its a daily 7x1""Lots of shit happened to brazil during last 4 years. It snowballed insanely deep and fast, its insane. We see a daily 7x1 in so many different forms"
dps8j7o,zwasfi,Maybe stop being so greedy?
dpsc9a9,MistaSmiles,7xgift
dpsd9ey,yourmamasmamasmurf,You mean the current year: 20brazil vs Germany?
dpsolrh,sjsr99,*Das 7x1
dpsqt6l,circlingldn,"dont worry, you have our lord and saviour to guide you know"
dps8gnz,breakr5,"should have been 8-0 or 9-0Ozil missed an open net late in the game, and Oscar's goal at 90' for Brazil was due to sloppy D. Germany got too cocky at the end and stopped playing."
dps9gp8,wymzyq,"If we are gonna play that game brasil came out hot in the early 2nd and missed 3-4 chances so it ""could"" have been 7-5 or a million different things could have happened and we probably have a different score. The game was 7-1 and that's already incredible and the odds of that happening where already astronomical so no need to play the ""could have been"" game. As a spurs (NBA) fan I can say that if they win the world cup championship by defeating Germany than the pain from 7-1 is close to erased."
dpslmye,Rando_Thoughtful,I think Germany slacked off in the end and gave up the goal so they weren't dragged out of their hotel and murdered that night.
dps9l2m,fodafoda,Brazilian here. Too son.
dps24g3,mrperiodniceguy,"France will take one of their spots, I bet"
dps361n,AbdulJahar,"You're probably right, but Germany-Brazil was a semi-final match.Argentina played Germany in the final."
dps41wf,randes70,"Yeah, that final was a classic too! Totally overshadowed by Luiz's tear soaked fro."
dps7p1n,afito,"> that final was a classic tooEven as a German, I think that's stretching it. Was a good game with some good moments, even funny ones like the Kramer incident, but really nothing people would remember in 20 years. The 7-1, 2006 final, the game of the century, the Baggio penalty, the Panenka, the 1954 final, those are things really worth remembering."
dps8ubv,MeC0195,2006 final is only remembered because Zidane got himself sent out epically. Also most of what you're listing is memorable only to a german/european
dpsekhy,,[deleted]
dpsfhl1,MeC0195,"If you ask an average Argentinian about the game of the century, he won't know what it is. And I see you haven't mentioned the Maracanazo, or when Argentina beat Brazil in Italy '90 after the brazilians hit the post 3 or 4 times, Maradona against England, and more South american football folklore."
dpsg1k1,PopusiMiKuracBre,Dude.... that's in the wrong century...
dpso3yh,dunderbrunde,The first guy said the 1954 final haha
dpt87yn,PopusiMiKuracBre,"Oh, fuck. I mixed it up with another comment talking about 7-1.Whoops."
dpsg6p2,MeC0195,?
dpskixq,PopusiMiKuracBre,"Game of the century. Your examples are in the 20th, he's talking about the 21st."
dpsvqeu,MeC0195,"Right, the 1954 final, the Panenka and Baggio's penalty are the 21st century, sure"
dpt86ja,PopusiMiKuracBre,...damn....I feel like an idiot.I mixed up the parent comment with another one talking about 7-1.My apologies.
dpt8nx1,MeC0195,"It's okay, it's happened to the best of us"
dpsg1p6,,[deleted]
dpso7j9,dunderbrunde,"Yes it does, to some people. For my dad the greatest world cup match was when Sweden took 3rd place 1994 but is that then as legendary as 7-1? He just pointed out that the games he named are Eurocentric which is a valid point."
dpsl1qc,bombo_red,"Not really, Italy was really a 'dark horse' of the bigger teams. That 2006 final, how did nobody figure Italy stood a chance? That defence was rock solid!"
dps9r8g,beeraffe1,That Baggio penalty was truly the most heart wrenching thing I had seen in sports.
dpsl4ll,bombo_red,"Me too, and as a kid in was rooting for Brazil. Bebeto, Romario... That was a team, and I'm not a Brazillian fan, I'm more Germany"
dps8kmd,mrgonzalez,And Netherlands were another one of the semi-finalists
dpsc14o,AppleDrops,Brazil were so shit in that game.
dpskizn,beelzeflub,Argentina got wrecked by Germany in the final you mean. 🇩🇪
dpsncah,preserved_fish,"It was a pretty tightly played game, and Argentina missed some wide-open chances. Germany looked like the better team on the field for most of the minutes.Wouldn't call it a classic, but it wasn't disappointing."
dps4qwd,huhgo,"Depends on Deschamps. Odds are he's not gonna start Martial , Dembélé or Lemar lol. On top of not selecting Benzema."
dps5gfv,Professional_Bob,"Hasn't Giroud been genuinely out-performing Benzema for France though? Plus they have Lacazette, Griezmann and Martial."
dps609i,LDKRZ,Imagine thing DD would call Martial up
dptr62o,Professional_Bob,Well he at least got called up for the friendly today. It's a lot more likely that he gets picked for the world cup than Benzema.
dps7by3,hyfhe,I assume you ment Mbappe for the last one? He assisted Giroud in the last match atleast.
dps7jbw,Professional_Bob,Well I don't really see Mbappe as competing for a spot with Benzema. He could of course play as a striker but is better utilised on the wing.Though I suppose the same could be said of Griezmann and Martial.
dps8bca,bohemiangangsta,"Griezmann is definitely a striker, but I see your point"
dpsppiz,ThePr1d3,"No one will compete with Benzema for a spot, he is banned from the national team"
dps8dhz,bohemiangangsta,"He has, and Benzema doesn't get along well with the rest of the team. I would still say he's worth a spot at the least though..."
dpsppsc,ThePr1d3,He is banned from our team
dpspoy7,ThePr1d3,And Mbappe Lemar Coman Dembélé Fekir. Our attack is stacked
dps8dx2,Minogam3,Have you even seen how Benzema is performing for Real Madrid right now? On top of his usual lackluster performances for the national team?
dps77e9,NC-Lurker,"Good riddance tbh. Benzema is way overrated and hyped by the media, but he's a burden."
dps6ybt,fraazing,Benzema isn't even French per say. His heart was never in the team. It's a good decision.
dps4nb3,kougabro,"Looks like we have a descent chance this time, I want my 1998 remake goddamnit!"
dps60d3,RoosterClan,"On paper, France and Belgium are straight stacked!"
dps8wdo,MeC0195,Belgium was just as stacked in 2014 and the euro...
dps9spt,RoosterClan,"I agree. Little experience and a really young team though. Two years SHOULD theoretically help and they're still young. But it's hard to ignore this team: Lukaku, Mertens, Hazard attacking De Bruyne feedingNainggollan and Fellaini pressingKompany, Alderweireld, and Vertonghen defending in front of Courtois. It's like my FIFA 18 UT"
dps6z9i,Ryham,Look for Belgium to be the surprise team to compete for the championship
dps6w4o,wfcchris,"Brazil is such a strong team now, remembers the 1982 side. Beautiful football, it will be a great match"

dpsbt2e,Hagibest,"True, but I felt like including them because they have strong football history and even now good individuals, but qualifying from Europe can be tough, as I'm sure you know. In a time when the likes of Iceland (all due respect, they've done unbelievable things considering their size) and Panama (though in an easier confederation) qualify for the WC, it's tough to see these teams with football culture and history being left out, even if they've missed a couple tournaments as it is.That said, really excited to see how the likes of Iceland, Egypt, Morocco, Panama will fare with the more traditional sides on such a massive stage!"
dpsla5r,bombo_red,U notice a tonne of crap has happened in most of those countries except probably Czech Republic

dps3r7f,bigbrycm,it's sad FIFA didn't implemate goal line technology yet for World Cup qualifiers. Everyone knows that ball didn't cross the line. Lol
dps7rkg,Craizinho,"Lol really, what's sad was the US whole qualifying campaign as opposed to one incident which took nothing out of your own hands... Despite the fact had it not been given its a clear penalty anyway. You're trying so hard to make an excuse and look at the negative despite the US losing to Trinidad in a must not lose game. Lol"
dps84x1,dlm891,"I'm a US fan, and none of us should complain about Panama's goal in the final match. US had so many opportunities throughout qualifying to get the lousy point they needed."
dps8b1b,Craizinho,"Yup bringing it up and implying it had major consequences for the US is completely irrelevant, petty and bitter. Of course goal line tech for all international teams should be a goal but for carribean and central American teams it just isn't viable tbh.And once again I have to say it would have been a penalty if not given as a goal anyway"
dpsc490,bigbrycm,Why isn't it viable for Caribbean and Central American teams? They're apart of concacaf and FIFA. They need to play by the same rules as everyone.
dpssszn,Craizinho,Small teams such as them that play like what 7 competitive home games over the course of 2 years isn't vital for goal line tech which costs so much more than you'd expect
dpslg85,da_newb,"So you think they shouldn't review goal footage? It's one of the most infrequent and simultaneously important events in the game. Checking those and PK calls wouldn't hurt the flow of the game.But yeah, the US should only complain about their team performance."
dpsspv1,Craizinho,Personally yeah I think they should but it should be done in the manner it is now in testing in minor games because the initial implementation is a farce even though it's quite simple but it's to be expected on such a grand scale across the globe.FIFA trying to make every single game from the Camp Nou to a Ugandan dirt pitch adhere to the same rules and be exactly the same in that regards is commendable in some ways but really held top tier football back needlessly
dpsckww,bigbrycm,"When I see the panama players celebrate knowing full well it didn't go in I have a problem. The same can be said about Thierry Henry and his handball against Ireland in 2009. Where's the honor? Refs will always have questionable calls but when you see it clear as day it didn't cross the line or you handball it, own up to it. Look at the videos of Klose from Germany admitting to the ref he used his hand to knock in a goal and the ref took the goal back. Look at the other videos of players intentionally missing a penalty kick because they knew their teammate took a dive or the ref called an incorrect handball in the box. there's no honor in soccer with the diving, fake injuries to get the other team a red card and sent off."
dpshq58,Nan_Ren,"I think that kind of shit is why soccer is never going to take over in the USA in the way people keep saying it will. I mean, you wouldn't always expect a player to admit to a referee error in an important game. But the diving is embarrassing to watch.In a lot of places diving is sort of admired as being a good strategy, but almost anyone in America is going to look at that with contempt. I can't imagine a kid here watching someone on TV faking an injury and rolling around on the ground and then that kid saying, 'wow... I want to be just like that when I grow up!'.Maybe we need to divorce soccer from FIFA and get some real administration in there. Everything associated with FIFA reeks of foul play and cheating."
dpssn2l,Craizinho,Yeah looking at diving from an ignorant perspective without any intention of trying to learn the game is pathetic but no it won't make an impact on the young people who actually and is just a thought process of the older generation.
dpsy457,bigbrycm,"If I could count the number of times players ""head butt"" or basically graze their opponent lightly touching each other's head and one of them flailing back and flopping to the ground id be a rich man. Or getting hit in the limbs or shoulder and grabbing their face like they got hit there instead a la rivaldo in the 2002 World Cup. I don't know why FIFA doesn't suspend and fine players for this and crackdown on it. It's laughable. I've played soccer all my life and it's embarrassing that soccer has this reputation and FIFA does nothing to prevent it and accepts it in their game. Young players are looking up to this you have to realize this and emulating it.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OiW0IPrv1Rohttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5m05wUhJwvM"
dpsyrjn,Craizinho,"Yeah some players act like a fool, just as in other sports... Sure in some more than others it's not as beneficial to go down pretending you've been shot but still. You don't why the global administration doesn't crack down on individual instances? Like seriously there is backlash and retrospective action is just as laughable to any fan in two obvious extreme examples you linked which are clearly not normal. The manager in question actually got fired because of that and Rivaldo had a ball kicked at him so there's no punishment that can be given for his pathetic response.You can't enforce a manly rule to keep players acting tough especially when it's global and not a single league entity like all American sports where everything can be resolved on a case by case basis. There is fines and suspensions for cheating the ref with embellishments but how can you go about policing a reaction like Rivaldos no matter how humiliating it is"
dpt0c0t,bigbrycm,"I guess I don't understand. Just because he got a ball kicked at him doesn't mean he gets any sympathy. He clearly faked getting hit in the face. FIFA should've fined and suspended him for the final. Players have all the incentive to get players ejected especially in high profile games like this one. Thanks why I'm all about VAR and retroactively punishing players. In America, there's 3 things associated with soccer, low scoring, diving/embellishing,fake injuries/ and ties. I'm not against changing anything except for eliminating the diving. It's so simple to eradicate. Then people wonder why in the US it's considered a girly and unmanly game because you got these strong men reacting like this."
dpt0z2a,Craizinho,Reacting like what? one example from a notable game 16 years ago after getting kicked with a ball unnecessarily? He's been ridiculed non stop for that and honestly his whole career is marred by it because as much as I've heard he was amazing this is what he's remembered for. Sure you can bring up a couple from every season but that's over the course almost hundreds of thousands of games exponentially bigger than any US sports.Yeah Americas perspective is ignorant and irrelevant like I say that it really doesn't matter trying to change that when they have no intention of learning the game. The rest of the worlds perception of the NFL is boring/time outs/commercials etc. You say you've played football but think diving is so simple to eradicate really?It's a free flowing contact game with no stoppages so you're going to always have clash on the ankles that are impact injuries that take a min or 2 to recover and it's stupid to try Americanise that and punish the skillful players by not providing protection in the regards and just getting big bruisers instead. Even the most innocuous hit can be bad when you're sprinting full speed with an object at your feet. And with that there's some who'll try avoid contact but are still obstructed and have to go down. So much nuance that it's not just an easy fix as clueless people suggest.
dpt7q5f,Nan_Ren,"Diving isn't popular in most of Northern Europe either, particularly England. Are they ignorant and irrelevant, too? English league football is a more physical and athletic style of game because of this belief, and the Premier League has immense popularity worldwide so there must be some demand for this style of play. This is a spectator sport here. Maybe that kind of shit is great to watch when your team is benefiting from it, but you can't possibly say that it makes a football match more entertaining to watch in any other situation."
dpt8jad,Craizinho,"Mate I'm not saying anything on what is entertaining or not, I said myself the likes of Rivaldo and the ones who pull that shit are ridiculed but then there's also the case where nifty players like Neymar who try avoid contact but are still fouled and go down easy are misinterpreted as diving and cheating etc... My point was it's impossible to police a persons reaction to incidents like that? Especially when like you say it's a global game and different cultures approach it differently with some being tough men and others not confrontational at all"
dpt0h64,bigbrycm,"I guess I don't understand either with FIBA, the international basketball association, they implement rules that countries have to abide by, why can't FIFA do the same?"
dpt1b0d,Craizinho,FIFA obviously do in regards to rules of the game but can you expand on FIBA like what you referring to?
dpsskj0,Craizinho,Bro I'm Irish the situation isn't comparable what's so ever in the slightest. The game was irrelevant to who Panama were playing and had the goal not be given it was a penalty which more than likely had of resulted in a goal and a card. They didn't even celebrate that goal because they knew a draw meant nothing to them.Like maybe you'd have a point in a game of significance for both teams but it didn't matter in the grand scheme and changed nothing from the fact all the US had to do was not lose and go through.Henry was blatant cheating and conning the ref against an underdog who matched them in every way and should really be winning on the and celebrating in the dying embers of a playoff game which clearly meant so much more to us. That is disgraceful and a shame. Panama went with a decision that was assured as opposed to the penalty and had no bearing on the opponent.And why make this about only football and try turn it into diving etc. Happens in all others too?
dpslddd,bombo_red,"Life is messed up, football should be like life - messed up. No more technology than the referees. Life's a bitch, that's what makes it fun, let football be like that too."

A problem our football federation doesn't wont to address with the due severity for economic reasons and because the top men of the federation are a product of that same cultural substratum (the still-in-charge president of the figc, for example, has been caught insulting black people three years ago, and jewish people and homosexuals some months later with no backlash.I hope this defeat will be the opportunity the italian football moviment needed to rebuild itself sportily but also morally.It will never happen, but someone can still hope.We usually are not like that, I assure you just witnessed the worst our society can produce.EDIT: some links, in italian sorry, about our beloved presidenthttp://www.ilgiornale.it/news/sport/tavecchio-stranieri-mangia-banane-1041032.htmlhttp://www.corriere.it/cronache/15_ottobre_31/tavecchio-gay-ebrei-ebreaccio-figc-omosessuali-5fb33858-7fff-11e5-8b57-f1b8d18d1f0e.shtml"

dpsh9xf,Nonzi,Because it didn't happen. I was there
dpsqhps,Jira93,That's bullshit. The guy commenting the game said it and you could clearly hear it even from television. Ill try to get a video when I get home later. It just was less evident cause there weren't 80k people at the stadium
dpstg3c,You_Will_Die,"I was also there and did not hear boos, I was on the opposite side of the video you linked. Which means really small parts booed but the majority did not."

dpsu41f,You_Will_Die,What you need pictures of my ticket? In Italy the whole crowd booed and literally everyone knows it. In Stockholm some could hear it in certain sections and not even loud.
dpsvapm,Jira93,"Italians saw the first match on tv and the boos were evident. Im not saying it is ok to do the same, but the reason is pretty clear"
dpsvmca,You_Will_Die,The thing is it can't even be compared to how it was in the last game. There were some sections here and there that wasn't even loud enough for me to hear in Stockholm. In San Siro the full arena gave it their all to boo and everyone knows it. Why do you think there wasn't any complains in Stockholm? It wasn't even close to the same thing.
dpsvtxc,Jira93,"Doesnt care how many they were, if italians see their anthem booed, ofc they will boo theirself. Seems like you cant see my point. If the first game would have been played in Italy, noone would have booed at all. Do you get me?"

dpsd12r,MrTapz,"Oh yes, not letting through a single goal in 180 minutes against Italy is lucky."
dpsnuxf,MrLogicWins,Lucky is the deflection goal they scored.. Lucky is the goal that was incorrectly disallowed in game 1 against holland. Lucky is Lloris making that super rare mistake to gift 2 extra points to sweden. They wouldnt have made it out of the group without both of these.They play good enough and I personally believe deserved more than both holland and italy yo go through. But yo deny how lucky they were is just illogical.
dpsvmjy,Kovy71,Lucky as in being in a group with Holland and France? As in getting Italy in the playoff? Clearly the luckiest team out there

dpslejl,MagicMax96,"No, I would say they generally remember about the same amount of the post-war stuff. It's just that nobody really knows anything much about the pre-war World Cups, which is where a lot of Italy's success came. I think most people would rate the Netherlands and Italy as being similarly successful within the last 40 or 50 years."
dpslymm,gunsof,And Italy literally won twice in the last 40-50 years so that's ridiculous. Being second isn't the same as winning it.
dpslfpo,MartinBlank73,People are idiots. Use the internet much?

Italy, up until now, missed none since 1958.These are the best 8 consecutive World Cups for the Netherlands that they've appeared at (74,78,90,94,98,06,10,14), and best 8 consecutive World Cups for Italy in the same period (so 78-2006 since in 74, 10 and 14 they've dropped out in the group stage).Netherlands | F | F | R16 | QF | 4th | R16 | F | 3rd-----------|-|-|---|--|---|---|-|---**Italy** | **4th** | **W** | **R16** | **3rd** | **F** | **QF** | **R16** | **W**Or, to put it like this:Italy | W | W | F | 3rd | 4th | QF | R16 | R16-----|-|-|-|---|---|--|---|---Netherlands | F | F | F | 3rd | 4th | QF | R16 | R16"

dps4b6q,lonestarhandy,"Yeah but Indians are like the most unathletic people on the face of the earth. Americans are actually good at sports, generally speaking.America also has a large club soccer system that is basically just a big scam. American families who put their kids on ""high-level"" soccer clubs are paying more than just about anywhere else in the world, and the results are inexcusably bad. The US club system has literally never produced a world class player. It's pathetic. If I were a club soccer coach in the US I honestly don't know how I could sleep at night, being such a hideous thief.edit: Sorry if this comment offended any Indian redditors but, until pooping in the street becomes an Olympic event, I stand by my comment."
dpscx86,HoMaster,"It's not that Indians are unathletic. It's that India doesn't have a system in place to support sports the way the US or other countries do, except Cricket. And that's due to the British influence."
dpsd4mt,lonestarhandy,"So if India had a well-developed system for Rugby, they'd be just as good as countries like Australia and New Zealand? I'm skeptical. I don't think there's a support system that can make the average Indian a foot taller and 80 pounds heavier."
dpsd9pn,HoMaster,China was a nobody in world sports competition until the government decided to pour money and resources into it. The same can be done in India if they had the money and the will.
dpsdfea,lonestarhandy,China is also an authoritarian country that will take a kid from their family to train at a sport because the kid is singled out as having favorable characteristics for it. India won't do that.
dpsdo8z,HoMaster,"So unless it's an authoritatian country throwing a kid into a sport you won't get results? Bottom line is if you invest money and resources into setting up a system to produce world athletes, you will get world athletes. The main problem with India in this regard is money. As you said, they can't afford toilets let alone a school system rich enough to support and nurture world class athletes."

dps8a53,dlm891,"> As far as I'm concerned, USA Soccer needs to be de-certified from FIFA.From what I've seen, the only reason FIFA ever suspends an FA is because of ""government interference"".Sometimes FIFA issues ""government interference"" bans for good reasons (such as politicians trying to put cronies on the FA) and sometimes it's for shitty reasons (like a government investigating financial fraud within a FA).All we need is for Trump to tweet about controlling USA Soccer, and FIFA will bring out the ban hammer in about 2 minutes."
dps9g6f,MeC0195,"Population has nothing to do with it. Look at Uruguay, or the Netherlands, or Iceland"
dps9j75,lonestarhandy,"I understand that. The point is that the US has millions of kids playing soccer that are just as athletic as the kids in Uruguay, the Netherlands, or Iceland...yet they can't field a team as good as them. This indicates that the developmental system is completely broken."
dpsau1p,MeC0195,"Athleticism isn't everything. In football it's much less important than it is in american sports. The thing is that american kids lack the football culture other countries have. In Argentina, I grew up surrounded by it, molded by it even. The entire country paralizes when the national team plays. I see kids playing in parks every day. Rich, poor, it doesn't matter. You grow up supporting a club, and follow it no matter how good or bad it is. Even my relatively small city (about 45k people) has like 5 or 6 clubs, with lots of categories divided by age. You could have the best coaches in the world, but if the kids don't *really* breathe football, if soccer is just something they do after school, it won't matter."
dpsbe74,lonestarhandy,"There are plenty of kids in America that live and breathe soccer. This is a nation of immigrants, most of whom come from soccer-loving countries. Certainly enough to field a decent club."
dpscdfp,MeC0195,"Yeah, but they grew up in America, not Germany or Italy. The country doesn't freeze during the *Superclásico*, the spanish *clásico* or the *Derby della Madonnina*. The sport is not on the regular news every day. No, they see the Superbowl, and LeBron this, and the NY Yankees that. There's no american football star. Donovan and Dempsey are the closest, but nothing compared to the way Mexico sees Chicharito, or Costa Rica sees Keylor Navas (and I'm not even talking about Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, Iniesta or Pirlo). Football there is seen as something only latinos and immigrants like, and most of the country ignores it.And yes, that should be enough to field a decent club, but to have a good national team, you can't just have 25 good players. You need hundreds or thousands."

dps8m1m,lonestarhandy,You don't think America has at least 11 people that live and breathe soccer? America has more kids that live and breathe soccer than many countries that are far better do.
dps9l4d,MeC0195,"Not really. I doubt you'll find kids in the US that ""live and breathe soccer"" the way kids do in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Spain, Italy or even parts of Africa."
dps9zn2,lonestarhandy,"Trust me, you're wrong on this one. I grew up in an area with plenty of kids whose parents grew up in places like Germany, Italy, and other soccer-hungry countries and they spread that love to their kids. The US just doesn't have the system to develop the kids the way their birth countries do."
dpsb2o1,MeC0195,"See my other reply to you. Still, even if this is true, in the case of Argentina, Brazil or Uruguay, there are no ""areas"" like that. The entire country is that way. Football-crazy kids are the norm, not the exception."
dps8s87,,So how the hell did we not qualify? I'm still trying to figure that out. Other countries' kids “live and breathe football” more than ours??
dps8zyi,lonestarhandy,Because the people responsible for guiding the kids who live and breathe soccer (the coaches and administrators in USA soccer) are failing these kids at the most fundamental level.Jurgen Klinsmann recognized this and they rode him out on a rail because of it. Can't have some German guy disrupting the gravy train of collecting thousands of dollars from rich kids' families without having to get any remotely decent results. There's a reason the only young players he ever considered playing were Army brats developed in other countries -- he saw how useless the US club system was.
dps9lm8,,"Sigh. That is deeply saddening. It sucks that we have to wait 4 years til the next go around, but at the very least, that is a lot of time to make reforms. I feel sorry most of all to Major League Soccer. The MLS clubs have been doing so well, and the US not qualifying for the World Cup is a major blow to American soccer."
dps9szz,lonestarhandy,The MLS clubs are part of the problem. They sign these really talented 16-18 year old kids and then make them sit on the bench in favor of 30-year old American players that completely suck and will never do anything at the international level. Christian Pulisic actually brought up this exact point in a recent article he wrote.
dpsaxr1,,"That's true. It's the MLS clubs that are supplying players to the international team, after all. So now we have to grapple with bureaucracy & seniority, too?"
dpsahco,LauraLorene,"This is true. My oldest nephew is legitimately the most athletic kid I've ever seen, and he has lived and breathed the sport since he was 2.5 years old and managed to get the ball away from the players on his older sister's team (and I say this as impartially as possible, not as a proud aunt - my other niblings are clever and athletic, but I wouldn't call them more than just above average). My brother (his dad) has more money than is good for him, and he just shovels it into private coaches, trainers, club teams, constant travel, etc for this kid. And even with so much raw talent and the best training money can buy here, he's not getting anywhere near the development he would be getting almost anywhere else in the world at his age. It's a shame, because the kids lucky enough to find something that they have a natural talent for and love to do deserve to at least have *the opportunity* to do it at the highest level they can reach."
dpsm33x,Idonotlikemushrooms,"I remember reading how Zlatan would constantly play football, even have a ball under his desk at school. He wasnt rich and he says himself he was a juvenile as a kid. You put too much on the trainers when the real champions never stop working, if ypur nephew really wanted it HE would work for it not lay everything on his fathers money."
dpsqrts,LauraLorene,"Holy shit, you are such an asshole. I know it's reddit, and we're all kind of assholes, but even so, you are so far above average on the asshole meter we may have to rescale it.The level of confidence you have in your knowledge of a strange 11 year old child you've never met, including how much effort he puts into a sport that he loves, is staggering. Absolutely staggeringly, ridiculously stupid. Someone should seriously study you."
dpsrk4b,Idonotlikemushrooms,Tbh you are right that i sound like a prick i didnt mean to convey that the kid is at fault. I only meant that its not only about the Clubs but how much effort is put in on the free time. But yes you are right i am sorry for my comment it was extremely unthoughtful i am sure your nephew is talented..
dpst1za,LauraLorene,"Yeah, sorry I reacted harshly. I apparently get pretty upset when strangers insult children I love.In nephew's defense, he commits most weekends year round to travel/games/tournaments, plays on multiple teams (some invitational), and spends *at minimum* 90 minutes a day playing, practicing, or training. Every day. Year round. And still wants to watch pro games and tell you about his favorite players during his down time. He's 11. I don't know what more you could ask from an 11 year old to demonstrate commitment or drive."
dpst80s,Idonotlikemushrooms,No its normal I would probably feel the same..Well then in that case its sound like he works hard and he is only 11 so its still too early to tell. Also I didnt try to insult him since he probably works much harder than me but it was more of a generall statement that on the end its the child own commitment that will prove how good he is rather than the clubs so if he succedes thats more on his own commitment and effort rather than a trainer because then he is then one who worked hard (atleast at that age).

When I watch them play, I have never thought, ""Wow they just aren't as athletic as countries like Brazil or Germany"". They're just way less skilled."
dps7muu,uninanx,It's not mind boggling at all. Soccer is like the 7th most popular sport in the US. American athletes don't even consider it. Whereas in smaller countries all the top athletes go to play soccer.
dps7t4t,lonestarhandy,I've heard this argument for years and I don't buy it. The USMNT has no problem with athleticism. They aren't being outrun or out-jumped by other teams like when Saudi Arabia plays Germany. Their fitness level is pretty high too. It's all about their lack of skill.
dpsac65,itouchboobs,"If you're a great athlete in America you aren't playing soccer because there is no money there. You're starting with 2nd tier players. They still can be very good, but they are far from the best that could be offered."

If they were athletic they would be playing one of the major sports"
dps89kl,lonestarhandy,"Pure athleticism like you see in the NFL or NBA isn't as necessary in soccer though. You don't have to be a 6'8'' monster that can jump 4 feet in the air to be a great soccer player. Neymar and Messi could NEVER play in the NBA or the NFL, yet they're world-class players."

dps5p59,lonestarhandy,"Yeah I've heard that ""America's best athletes don't play soccer"" argument for years but I don't think it holds water. Neymar or Messi could never play in the NBA or the NFL yet they are world-class players. There are plenty of athletic kids in the US that grow up playing soccer -- as many as anywhere in the world. They just don't receive the coaching and skill development they need to excel at the international level. It's not about a lack of athletes -- it's about not developing the athletes they have."
dpsa1es,MeC0195,"When I see american players on the pitch I can see they lack instinct. They don't hustle, they don't play intelligently, they don't have the creativity, they don't move well without the ball. It's like they want to be instructed play to play like it's basketball or american football. I'm talking about the team functioning as a whole. Ball movement, player movement, etc. They lack proper coaching. They don't need to be taught specific plays or situations, they have to be taught how to think like footballers."

dps44ti,LordRobin------RM,"No one's saying we're a “good” team. It's just that, since 1986, qualification has been taken as a given. We're a not-weak country in a weak confederation. Qualification has been the US, Mexico, and one other team for over a generation. It's surprising not to see us there."
dps4egn,interprime,"Well, at this rate, Costa Rica should be really considered as the third team. (Or even second team, given their results over the last few years). It's becoming a weirdly strong group of teams, slowly but surely.

dps65qi,Charlie_Wax,"""Good"" is relative. The best comparison for the USA that I've heard is that we're like the Celtic or Rangers of international play. We are a giant in our region, but in the big tournaments we are underdogs. It's like how Celtic always walk their league, but then come up against giants in the CL where they are big underdogs. Also, the USA went to the quarters in 2002 and got out of the group in 2010 and 2014. We've never been contenders, but we're a relatively ""good"" team still."

dprz5pg,StuffSpurs,"True, but at the same time no Zlatan might help them. Sometimes relying too much on one player hurts you as a team, and removing that player makes you play better."
dpsa6u6,MeC0195,Portugal only won the Euro because CR7 was out. When he left they finally started playing like a team.
dpsfgbu,ParadoxalDream,"I guess I was a fool to cheer when Messi ""canceled"" his international retirement :("
dpsfj0o,MeC0195,Explain?
dpsgrva,ParadoxalDream,"He announced his retirement from Argentina's national team in June 2016 after their penalty shoot-out loss against Chile in the Copa America final. Following your logic, the team would have had a better chance to win something without him lolBut two months later he retracted himself and he played the 2018 WC qualification matches since then."
dpsh669,MeC0195,"I know what happened, I'm Argentinian. The difference is that Messi plays for the team, while Portugal plays for Cristiano. Messi is Argentina's creator, so we play better with him, always. Portugal's entire strategy was ""pass it to Cristiano"", and when he left the pitch, they started playing more as a real team. I'm not saying they are better without him, but they should see him as a great player who's part of a team, not as Jesus."
dpshwdu,ParadoxalDream,"It was a (attempted) joke, I'm not claiming they would be better without Messi either.To be fair though, Ronaldo needs to be fed the ball to score so I can understand the logic behind how Portugal was playing with him in the team. Messi is an artist and can create a play on his own so, theoretically, his absence would hurt the team much more."
dpsm83u,bombo_red,"Argentina has always had that 'one' player since 78, only Ortega never really lived up to the expectation."

dpsivl0,Sgtoren,"True, but Sweden Looked clueless in attack in Milan. Once they had the ball, there was no support and countless stray passes and crosses. With someone like Ibra guiding them, they may very well have created a real threat on the counter."
dpt0gpv,Gnomification,"Although true, that probably had more to do with the 0-1 aggregate lead. A 0-0 is a win. A goal against you is still a tie. It was a defensive and boring play, but in the end it was a win.I don't really think you can take a game like that and say ""It would've been completely different with Zlatan!"". Sweden has proven they are more than good enough without Zlatan by qualifying from a group with France, Netherlands, Bulgaria, and then getting that 1-0 win against Italy.Like our head coach said to the journalists after the game: ""Stop talking about Zlatan. This is the team that made the world cup.""With Zlatan, we did not qualify for the 2 previous ones. There's really no other way to see it, regardless of how good Zlatan might be individually."
dpsm51t,bombo_red,Brazil - Neymar of 2014 kinda pokes a hole in your argument.
dpsosl1,Urabutbl,"Yup. With Zlatan on the team, every player in the Swedish team played “pass it to Zlatan”-ball. Which of course is a ridiculously easy tactic to counter. In some ways, Man U suffered from the same thing before Zlatan's injury last year.That said, Sweden now has a “oh, no, YOU take the shot”-problem up front, where they'd rather pass it one too many times and lose the ball in search of the “perfect” shot rather than sometimes just having a go from an angle. Sadly, that means they never surprise anyone, never get odd rebounds, etc etc, and they aren't really good enough to pull off the plays against good defenders. It's like the players are so scared of being “selfish” they'd rather lose than do something that might be construed as not following the playbook exactly."
dps2cjb,FourtyCreekJohn,You're overthinking it
dps4mjt,chase_witt,"No, he has a point. This does happen and not just in football. I'm a big Ibra fan, too. Also, talking about this specific example, I️ do think he is wrong. Ibra is great at holding up play and coming back to help in the midfield. Hard to imagine Sweden not defending as well with Ibra on the pitch."
dps5b2l,FourtyCreekJohn,"Listen I get it, but these are star players, star players are stars for a reason. 90% of the time they're beneficial, The other 10 is his hyperbolic statement"
dpscobr,MultiverseWolf,Zlatan himself said Sweden is playing better without him.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/09/zlatan-ibrahimovic-sweden-no-return-world-cup
dps6109,chase_witt,"Yeah I️ agree with that. Just saying his statement wasn't wrong, as there are cases where a player can be detrimental to the team not matter his status as a star player or otherwise. Both sides have a point here is all I️ meant to point out"
dps6k2r,Professional_Bob,Ibra pretty much said the same thing as justification for why he wouldn't come out of retirement even if Sweden qualified.
dps8qub,TzunSu,"When did he say this? He's been saying he's open to the idea today, and his manager promised to ""hand deliver him if he want's to play"""
dps8xjd,Professional_Bob,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/nov/09/zlatan-ibrahimovic-sweden-no-return-world-cup
dps9bal,TzunSu,Will be interesting to see how that goes.
dps9o4p,Professional_Bob,"I think it is definitely the right decision. If he changes his mind then the management staff should turn him down. Sweden have played better without him. They used to rely on him far too much, and their attacks often became repetitive and predictable because they seemed reluctant to try out anything which didn't have him as the focal point."
dpsa0da,TzunSu,"Sure, but a new coach and some self confidence might change that. I think he could be a good addition, but it's a bit risky. And I would like to see this squad that's defied expectations sticking together to the end."
dpslo2p,borggren4,"Id say the major issue with the current troop is we lack competent forwards. Janne has built a strong troop defensively, strategically and mentally. So theoretically Zlatan would be awesome for this team as he fills the void of lackluster attack (aka replacing Toivonen). At the moment we have Berg who can shine when facing a weaker team but when facing star defense it becomes pretty clear that he lack quality. My suggestion to Janne is that he opens a vote for all the players if they want Zlatan back (given that he wants to) and base his decision off that. If Zlatan comes back he will get all creds for anything good that happens so this is a sacrifice the other players must make so therefore they should be a part of the decision process. Personally I believe the players can handle Zlatans ego and their team spirit will remain strong because they've already proven their competence without him."
dps7ena,fl_ick,Portugal won euros without Ronaldo in the final match!
dps8prr,TzunSu,We didn't qualify with Zlatan once though.
dpsabj3,,[deleted]
dpslzwk,borggren4,I don't think Zlatan was the issue in Hamrens troop. It was just the lack of confidence of the other players combined with bad strategic leadership of Hamren. Now the other players has confidence and we have a strong strategic leadership with Janne. Who can say we have a better chance with Toivonen over Zlatan given we play with the same strategic mindset and given that Zlatan has the same quality as before his injury.

dpse22d,8lackJack8lack,"I am with you on this one. I often reflect back on that tournament and the team (plus Guus Hiddink) we sent combined with fixtures and we were as good a chance as any of winning it. (Don't forget Greece in 2004)We kept Italy under wraps for 91 minutes and were bossing them towards the end due to the extra man advantage. Granted we didn't actually create many chances against them... but who does? ... against Italy.We had them down to 10 men and 30 minutes of extra time coming up. If we win that game we faced Ukraine next up, they navigated an easy group overcoming Saudi and Tunisia to finish behind Spain. They had just beaten Swiss on penalties and I fancied our chances against them. Then we have a semi-final against Germany. Tough match and a likely German win but in this game anything is possible. (Yanks still having nightmares about Trinidad)"
dpsl9pj,Not_The_Truthiest,"Same. Fuck the Italian Diving Team. Such a load of bullshit. I don't normally will a country to lose, but as I was driving to work this morning and I heard ""Italy a minutes away from not qualifying for the World Cup"", it was the most interested in soccer I've been for ages. Even if we lose to Honduras, this will still be marked down as a pretty good outcome in my book."

dpsz3vj,recoveryphase12,"Yep, I'm a Liechtenstein fan and this was the best chance we had of winning the World Cup but that was put to bed when Italy beat us 5-0."
dpsr443,chunlongqua,"Ok, as much as I sympathise, let's be honest here. You had italy down to 10 man for a straight red call that it was as arguable as the penalty. Your guy fell like he was shot, but Materazzi actually hit Zambrotta's shin. Once you see that called as a red, you have to know that the ref is being strict on the day. Regardless even in Sunday league you don't tackle in the box at the 90th minute of a game unless a) you're absolutely sure you'll get clean contact on the ball b) you're doing it to stop a certain goal. The intervention on grosso was goofy and uncoordinated. He completely missed the ball and obstructed a guy in the box that had just run 30 meters full throttle in the last minute of an elimination game. No way in hell that any player worth its salt would stay up in that situation, and your players were smart enough that they would have absolutely done the same. Not only that, had you guys had that call and had it been not given you would still rightfully complain about that time that you had a legitimate penalty call ignored."
dpthcoi,gyozaaa,"I remember watching that match... I wasn't even an Australia fan but I was so pissed off. To make things worse, on the channel I was watching on, there was this American commentator who kept defending Grosso, saying ""he sold himself well!"" I was so pissed that Italy won that WC; one of the dirtiest and most boring teams to win a World Cup in recent memory.Still have to say, it's a shame not having them play in this one, especially given that it may be the last match that many of the veterans (who are actually good human beings) play."
dpsjp3w,StuartBannigan,I mean you must be joking if you think Australia actually had any chance of winning the World Cup
dpsjvsx,Sketchkov,We had Italy just about beaten and down to 10 men and they went on to win it? I did say slim chance but if we'd beaten Italy why not?
dpsk7w9,StuartBannigan,"Because you'd then have to play Germany and France later on in the competition.Beating Italy is one thing, beating all three of the best teams in the entire tournament is a whole other thing. It would be like someone at your local boxing club beating Muhammad Ali, only to then have to fight 2 more Muhammad Ali's. The chances of that actually happening are nil"
dpske1n,Sketchkov,Because underdogs have never gone on a dream run and won a major competition...Except 2 years earlier when Greece did it
dpskkgp,StuartBannigan,"I mean there's kind of a difference between beating France, Czech Republic and Portugal and beating Italy, Germany and France. And that Greece team were better than Australia.Australia won one match at that World Cup, against Japan. If they had a chance to win it, so did literally every other team that took part"
dpslqe6,ChampagneCJ,Every team did in fact have a chance.
dpsnxb5,StuartBannigan,Then you can go further and say that every team that was in the qualifying process had a chance to win it. British Virgin Islands and San Marino had a chance of winning the World Cup

dps411v,rocavibe,They also had a world class team.
dps6vlv,A_Bit_Of_Nonsense,They had a good team no doubt but they were pretty big underdogs to beat Germany and France.
dpup2dx,Prisencolinensinai,"What? No! The team had a very defensive pace and all but it was full of stars that were already making a show outside the cup. Buffon was already famous, del Piero was one of the best in the attack in Champions league;Totti was becoming really famous for what it did to Roma; Cannavaro already was very famous. Pirlo is considered one of the best in his position. They weren't underdogs just because they were italy"

dpslmf4,X-ScissorSisters,"For me in New Zealand, a playoff against a South American team really stops it from feeling like a World Cup. More like a bunch of hoops we can barely hope to jump through. There is no representation from my part of the world at all (unless we beat Peru for some reason)"

dpstyxk,weasdasfa,> only the best teams should play in the world cup.Then why have continental quotas? Best teams are in EU and SA. Let's exclude everyone out?
dpt000c,refwdfwdrepost,I wouldn't mind the champions league approch where only a few national leagues joins the group stage directly and most national leagues get a few spots in he qualification rounds. And if the teams are good enough they will earn their spot. To me the qualification to the world cup in itself is part of the charm. It shouldn't be easy to qualify. But why not have more inter-confederative qualifications.
dpu36j8,weasdasfa,"That will give us higher quality games, but gives very little exposure to small guys. Little exposure -> less money -> can't invest to get better. > And if the teams are good enough they will earn their spot. It sounds good in theory, but you will end up with a small group of teams every time. Just like the CL. Even CL has country quotas or else we would just be watching teams from the big 4 countries + 1 or 2 from some where else."

dpsyjpp,AbismoNegroJr,I think Netherlands feels the same way
dpsu5fc,AbismoNegroJr,"Actually this time I personally didn't had so high expectations, the squad wasn't that great and the play very dull.But I mean making the WC should't be that high of a goal for a team like Italy, whichever the roster may be... as I reckon for England the problem is winning something and then coming up short but a WC is a story of its own, very hard to predict what is going to happen"
dpsm288,bombo_red,"World Cup after World cup since 1966, best chance they had was 27 years ago... The guys from England suffer from a bit of entitlement."
dps8opw,TzunSu,Booing during the national anthem was also a disgrace.
dpsu1eu,AbismoNegroJr,"Yeah absolutely, no excuses for that"
dpsj8s8,KRIEGLERR,"Would you take Balotelli back ? He's been doing pretty well in France and has really changed his attitude, guess he finally grew up."
dpsu8ay,AbismoNegroJr,"We need consistent players to rely on more than anything. Balotelli is doing good but he may not be the solution we need.For me the absolute priority should be the midfield, Verratti has to step up or a real top player is missing in there."
dpsnet2,Waxtree,"Look at the attackers, honestly. Then take the time to consider that in 2006 we had a del Piero even on the bench."
dpsubi3,AbismoNegroJr,Damn right. To think in the 90's Baggio more often than not was left home...
dpsvaeo,dreampitcher,Picked a shit eleven. Ridiculous to let Insigne sit on the bench the whole game. De Rossi's reaction speaks volumes.. Why he didn't pick Giovinco for the squad? What a pear shaped loser
dpsekw6,MyPostIs,"Non so come brava la squadra avrebbe fatto se si fosse qualificato. Mi sembra con questo allenatore di merda, non sarebbe andato oltre la fase a gironi."

dpsruej,PistolPojken,As a swede I'm gutted about Buffon... Rip legend. Sad way to go out.
dpsvn1y,beanie1337,"Yeah we're extreamly proud. People mention this _almost_ as big as the bronse medal in '94. And what they mean by this is that we had Netherlands (sure, not as good as they used to be, but still should beat us) and France in our group, manage to win against both and then later beat Italy in playoffs. Many of us had ZERO expectations to qualify (even before the group stage started) for the world cup and now we're here, truly a proud moment. Will sure miss Buffon, a bigger gentlemen of the sport is hard to find."
dpt28ed,arnoldit,I came to think that ibrahimovic does a better job by not playing for his national team than he did when he used to play. Your results improved a lot since he left
dpus7v6,beanie1337,Yes you can say that. But have in mind that we changed coach and he haven't played under the new one. Would rather see Zlatan then Berg/Toivonen if he comes back from the injury OK.
dpusu57,arnoldit,"I'm an AC Milan fan, I had the luck to see him play at San Siro, my god what a player.. An artist with the ball on his feet, even though he never played well in Champions League"

dpsnvxc,Lucacri,"Not really. He was applauding the fans while they were booing the Swedish anthem. As a player with such an importance in the team and in the nation, he should have done the opposite. (I'm italian, grew up watching him doing dirty shit like this)"
dpsp2a5,lobfil,He was applauding the Swedish national anthem while a section of the Italian fans were booing it.
dpsqnaz,Lucacri,Was he? Because it sounds a lot like a good cop out (as he has done in the past)
dpsu62m,quadrpl,"When I listen to current and former players speak on Buffon, it's clear that he's well known for being a great sportsman and respectful competitor. He's absolutely clapping the opponent's national anthem. With the Italian crowd booing the anthem and his Italian teammates taking dirty dives, its nice to see his class displayed on the pitch."
dptdk2h,Lucacri,"Buffon is the guy that went on tv after a game where a goal was not awarded because they weren't sure if the ball crossed the line or not (it did in the replay), and said “it didn't cross it, and even if it did I would never say otherwise”. That's scammy. And really, that's just one of the several things he did/say over the years"

A lot of them are being sold from Eredivisie way to soon and ended up flopping or rotting on the bench. The Van Persie / Sneijder / Robben / Van Der Vaart / Hunterlaar / de Jong generation is over and since then they haven't produced nearly enough players who made it into great clubs, I can only think of Blind, Strootman and De Vrij That's pretty sad coming from a nation that produces some of the all time best players and had a big impact in modern football."

dpy8d4n,Funcooker216,"I do like the US and England, but I'm much bigger into club football and player following than international football, I've always liked Italy cause I'm a GK when I play and Gigi Buffon is the best keeper to play in my opinion. The class and style of the Italian team is what attracts me, the country also has my favorite foods, the nicest brands when it comes to clothing, the fastest cars and the country reminds me of badass new york mob familys and those are general reasons I like the country Italy but I also love all the players...er former players. Buffon, Balotelli (My favorite player of all time being a city fan) Pirlo, Del Piero, Giorgio Chiellini, Leo Bonucci, I follow players more than teams in every sport and I just love all those players. But to the point of why I don't support US or England is because though they both have decent teams, the success of the teams are very low. I don't know the players on either country nearly half as well as I'm familiar with the Italian players, (being a juve fan too) so I'm drawn to the team with the players I enjoy watching for my clubs rather than home teams."

dpudxo9,bossmt_2,"Yeah, but Italy had to play Sweden for a chance because the hadn't been playing well and weren't in Pot A so they were drawn into a group with Spain."

dps9of7,jasta07,"Good. Never liked the Italian team after their attitude in the 2006 World Cup against Australia. Plus they're some of the worst divers in the game.We played Brazil in our last group match, they beat us easily but the Brazilians still praised our team and respected our players.Played Italy in the first knockout match and they only just beat us from the penalty spot in injury time and not a word of respect from the Italian players other than ""It was pretty easy""."
dpso7cq,MaddingMumbaikar,Your footballers paid for your cricketers' sins
dpsuipl,jasta07,Fair call.
dpsumhv,MaddingMumbaikar,"btw, always wondered why Aussies even follow cricket. You guys have so much going on with Rugby, Football and all the Olympics stuff.How does a fan base for the good ol' boring gentleman's game still thrive over there ?"

dps8ssv,TzunSu,"That's pretty much what Italy always does though. They're all made out of glass and tears, there's a reason why italian sportsmanship is an international joke."
dpsa6lv,Jira93,"That's fun, cause whenever I watch a European team play I see people diving and faking literally every contact. Especially spanish teams"
dpsahwn,TzunSu,"Not even close to the same level, but yes, the Spaniards are easily the second worst offender, and they routinely get shit for it. You don't see this in Sweden. (mostly because If you roll around crying every time someone touches you in Sweden you will get laughed out of the arena)"
dpsdk6p,riskyrofl,Still salty about how much diving the Italians did in that world cup
dpsreb6,dcpp4,"Which diving exactly? The penalty? Aussies and people who just want an excuse to hate on italians would have been crying for 11 years to date, had they had the same call not going in their direction. The rest of the tournament was just fantastic for them, they played brilliant football, scored a good amount and conceded only 2 throughout the tournament IIR."
dpsrz53,riskyrofl,"Not just the Australia game, the Italians were infamous for diving during the competition"
dpss922,dcpp4,"Yeah, again, when? Because i watched most matches and i just saw a solid team that deservedly won it."
dps8qi5,nianp,Oh my god! I say exactly the same thing any time the fucking Italians are brought up. I'm not saying Australia would have won that game but we weren't doing badly and were in with a chance.Fucking diving cheats.

dpsnzj5,BetweenTheCheeks,Group of death implies 4 top tier teams
dpss5qq,Rage1073,"Wtf no it doesn't, that's imposible because teams are seeded into groups, not drafted into them. You can easily sees these four teams into all four different seeds and you'd have a group of death. Clearly you don't watch very much football, do you?"
dpukhjp,BetweenTheCheeks,"I actually do, and a group of death would be 4 teams out of 4 being strong teams. I didn't literally mean ""top tier"" as in top seed"
dpuszt0,Rage1073,"Again, impossible because of seeding... or do you not understand what it means?"

dptane3,-dsh,"> Younglings dont give a shit about it anymore so its future its already doomed,I haven't talked to many italians but they one I did talk to were football fans."
dpsqrbw,SpunkedMeTrousers,"Ah FIFA, one of the only franchises as terrible as EA"
dpt1wex,W4ND4,Is world cup still relevant with FIFA's shaydy practices and bribery!? They are the equivalent of EA to gamers!
dpt7l82,StuffSpurs,"What lol? Yeah there has been some shady business, but the World Cup is still the biggest sporting event in the world, and people don't care about it any less."
dptlczd,Ledmonkey96,"After the Olympics that might be true...... I'm not entirely sure how the US games that lead up to the Super bowl count, or even whether it's a good comparison...."
dptm7s5,StuffSpurs,"OK I forgot about the Olympics, but I would insist that the World Cup is bigger than the NFL Super Bowl thing."
dptn3s8,Ledmonkey96,"For the 11 games of the NFL playoffs last season home viewership ranged from 25million for the first game to 111million for the Super bowl itself, attendance averaged a bit over 70k per game. FIFA does win by virtue of there being a fuck ton of games though, 2014 had 64 games with an average of 50k attendees"
dptqbaj,StuffSpurs,I think you have to look beyond attendances and amount of games or whatever. Just look at how far they reach. The World Cup is the main tournament of the most popular sport in the world. It is actually countries from all over the world rather than just teams. Every country on earth has the chance to enter. Just generally I think more people care and people care a lot more.
dptmisz,SEN1LE,AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHHAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAAHAHAHA SHOULDNT HAVE SWITCHED SIDES IN THE WAR YOU FUCKING BREADSTICKS
dpsde46,,"WOW...ICELAND is in FIFA and heavy hitters like SPAIN or NETHERLANDS are out...WOW WOW WOWEdit: My bad, i meant Italy. Not Spain. They are in."

dpsegyp,DIRTYDAN555,"https://twitter.com/FIFAWorldCup/status/916401974186336257Shit like this is why you don't go into r/sports thread , instead of r/soccer one."
dpseerp,ComputerSaysnooooo,What the fuck are you talking about lmao
dpsgoo9,akkbar,Now you know how I felt when my country (USA) didnt qualify. You still have better food than us tho.. :(
dpsjyvd,99LivesGaming,It's probably cause they suck at soccer

dps9m3v,nouareallallleft,downvoted cause im italian
dpsd7nm,SirRockodile,"Missing the Russian games? So what? Italys football has always had a more intelligent approach in comparison to other ( top-) leagues. I wonder if they also wouldn't have qualified if 2018s host would have been Footballs Motherland, instead of the dishonest comrades corruptomania"
dpsgqso,DBCrumpets,Where the competition is hosted plays literally no effect on the qualification.
dpsnmbk,SirRockodile,Nor does it affect the payouts
dpsnudh,DBCrumpets,If you think Italy would willingly toss a World Cup I've a bridge I'd like to sell you. Those players would give an arm and a leg to win the cup.
dpso3dk,SirRockodile,"No second opinion to that. It's just... they've become... sympathic by not participating. Ahh, Im getting old ☻"

dpso26f,Babladuar,"well lets see>isn't this because the national teams basically suck ass because the true pros don't want to risk injury for a weak paycheck?this is world cup qualifier not some anoying friendly match that dont count for anything. if italy don't win this they will not be in world cup which what happened last night. and playing in world cup is the biggest honor as an athlete in football.>and in the case of a disastrous blowout, you really don't have much to gain from it... where when you actually destroy and do well the whole tourney you're some sort of footnote because your competition was weak due to the nature of the teams.italy never do well in world cup after winning their last world cup in 2006 so i dont think they will steam roll team after team and thisis football. everything can happen.>Basically, it's a series of nationalist ""all-star"" games, where people who don't really play together all that often get together under the banner of ""their country"" and give it a whirl.and unlike any other all star match, if they win this they will be crowned as the king of football. remember, world cup is the highest competition in football and winning it will meant a lot.>It's like if you took the musicians from a few bands you like, all from the same country, and had them play a concert of folk songs from their country. It would be passable but not necessarily exceptional.i dont really understand this part.so yea what he said is rambling bullshit which is anoying if you are taking it seriously and replying it in a serious manner."
dpsgy1f,DBCrumpets,I can't think of any world class player in his prime that doesn't want to play in the world cup. It's the highest honour in football even if the champions league might be more competitive.
