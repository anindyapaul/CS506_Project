We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign and there are special people. We have 22 congressional medal of honor people. A very special person who, believe me, I read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is -- that's right, how did you possibly guess? Let me tell you about Reince. I've said Reince. I know it. I know it. Look at all of those people over there. I know it, Reince is a superstar.

So it's been what they call an historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job and I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job. I look very much forward to being your president and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years or maybe even eight years you will say so many of you worked so hard for us, with you you will say that ‚Äî you will say that that was something that you were ‚Äî really were very proud to do and I can ‚Äî thank you very much.\n",

      "I've been depressed for many years... hated my job, hated college, (took me eight years to get an engineering degree), hated the direction the country was going in (SJWs, identity politics, etc; I'd lost hope).  This election required voters to think critically; we had two very distinct choices for the first time in 40 years... and we won. My hope has been restored, my confidence in the country somewhat, and my personal confidence as someone who predicted he'd win in 2015 has been majorly, to the derision of my own family, who are mostly republican, totally restored. I'm contemplating taking another sick day. Many things went well for me today; I took it off mostly because I'm sooo bored at work, and always tired (I use little vacation or sick time); and because it was Election Day.  I wanted my happiness of not working karma to flow to trump. Not only did I fix a broken tool, I fixed a broken truck that sat idle in my yard for four months, and the COUNTRY WENT MAGA!  I've always wanted to run my own business: today has me feeling the confidence to do so!  I've been right now, more than I've been wrong. My family thought me crazy when I said Trump would win (way back in 2015 when he announced). Trump, however pitiful this sounds, has made me believe in myself again. I feel, under his presidency, my only hinderance to success is me. I can accept that. I cannot accept an oppressive government doctrine and be happy.\n",

As you enjoy your victory please remember to be kind to folks on the other side! We all need to work together now and come together behind president trump to try and help all Americans out! If your victory turns into a condemnation of your fallen foes then you'll end up no better that the business as usual Washington insiders you so strongly dislike.

Trump has shocked the world and snatched the oval office from the hands of incompetency and corruption. For the first time in a long, long time, I genuinely have faith and hope in the future of my country.\n",

      "Before announcing his run to the oval office 15 months ago, Donald Trump was living the life...he was on top of the world as the owner of wildly successful businesses that employed thousands of people, and at one point he was a reality TV star. But he sacrificed all of his wealth, his fame, and his lifestyle for his country. Throughout the election, Mr. Trump and his supporters were belittled by the mainstream media and even Hillary Clinton, who referred to Trump supporters as part of a \"basket of deplorables.\" Not that he isn't guilty of similar behavior directed at the other side, but Mr. Trump and his basket of deplorables has done the unthinkable. We have snatched the oval office from the hands of a candidate who has gone through what seems to be a 30-year-long spree of incompetency, scandal, and crime. From the establishment of the failed NAFTA deal and the intimidation/silencing of Mr. Clinton's sexual assault victims to the abandoning of four American heroes at Benghazi and the threatening of our national security by the use of a private server on which classified government information was distributed, we have single-handedly saved our great country from disaster.\n",

      "Under the presidency of Donald J. Trump, our country will prosper economically. Our country will be much safer and more secure thanks to a strengthened military and police forces. Speaking of police, law enforcement officers everywhere will be treated with the respect that they deserve. Black Lives Matter will be held accountable for their acts of domestic terrorism. Criminals will be treated like criminals, not \"victims\" of \"government oppression\", and held accountable for the crimes they commit. Hillary Clinton will finally be brought to justice for her crimes. Law and order will be restored. Judicial restraint will be applied in the Supreme Court. We will gain the upper hand in the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism. College students will be treated like adults as opposed to being treated like children, meaning that the end of the age of \"Safe Spaces\" and being offended by anything and everything that goes against certain viewpoints is upon us. Under Donald Trump, this country WILL BE GREAT AGAIN.\n",

Trump was very clever to set this up last year to neutralize the doc fraud machine at the very last minute.

Finally he'd made it Crystal clear that he would contest the election if he didn't win and there was even the hint of cheating.

Then I found this sub and man I was so happy to find people who were willing to have proper discussions. News that showed both sides of the story. Thanks. LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I can never shit on someone for their opinions because motives behind each and every individuals opinions are interesting. Either way, i feel the whole situation is interesting, congratulations. \n",
      "For a long time I was convinced he would win because I strongly believed that there was a large group of people that didn't want to admit they were voting for him (because of fear of being accused of racism or something else awful like that)\n",

      "Yes. When his supporters started getting beat up in the streets I knew the country wouldn't stand for that shit. When it turned out a lot of it was staged by the DNC....wew lad! And the MSM treating us like idiots, lying and shitting on us throughout this whole thing, THAT woke this country up BIG LEAGUE! \n",
      "I didn't think he would be able to overcome the odds, to be honest. With all the MSM against him, with all the corruption from the Clintons, etc etc. It just seemed like too much. I'm glad I was wrong.\n",
      "Until like the last week I thought he could six it but I had completely lost hope. Then when he was winning Virginia holy *shit*\n",
      "I thought he would win mainly by comparing the size of the crowds at the rallies, and comparing the number of followers in the Reddit sites and Tweeter accounts. It just seemed that she wasn't matching the same following as Trump, so that made me optimistic that the polls were not going to match the outcome.\n",

      "I'm actually majoring in environmental science and I plan to make a career out of it, and I'm a Trump voter. I have several reasons. First, Hillary would say anything to get elected and do nothing, she has lied so much that nothing she says can be taken as the truth. Her alliances lie with the special interests who funded her campaign and made her rich, including Saudi Arabia who is one of the biggest producers of oil in the world, and if you believe the conspiracy theories (which are just barely connected enough to make sense), they wanted an oil pipeline into Europe and the war in Syria is a proxy war to help make that happen, Russia is against it as they are the worlds second largest producer of natural gas behind us and would benefit from selling to Europe, she has been behind the keystone pipeline vigorously despite how her public stance on the matter changed, she has backed the TPP vigorously despite how her public opinion changed and countries that would benefit from the deal mostly produce goods by factories which are terrible for the environment, she would probably be bought out by the fracking industry anyways, so that wouldn't change, not to mention potential nuclear winter by blaming Russia for all her treason and hiding her corruption. \n",

Honestly I believe that we have bigger problems to deal with because we won't be able to do anything about the climate if we don't have a functional country anymore (although that's getting into other stuff), someone will always be there to dig up that coal, drill for that oil, extract that natural gas. In the end, my answer is that the earth will always be here, and I believe the best way people will learn and accept climate change is to learn from past mistakes, or else other people will just call into question your hypothetical scenarios.\n",

I personally think we're going to see ACA repealed and replaced with competition between states (Trump seems to like that), while keeping HSAs and the ability for those with pre-existing conditions to keep insurance.

That means no massive run-ups in price, which a single payer system encourages. You could see the beginnings of this with Obamacare - the insurance companies were raising their prices because they had no reason not to with the massive stipends and such. They were going to get paid no matter what because the government was going to give out as much money as people needed to be able to pay those prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a free market system, with competition across borders between ALL the companies, they will have to price their plans accordingly. This means that the people will get better prices, *and* the government will not be giving away huge amounts of money to make it affordable. Think of all the money that *won't* be flooding into the insurance companies - if there's one thing I think we can all agree on, it's that corporate executives make too much money!\n",

There is a lot that goes into what happens in a market, but this is the general drift of things if the market is allowed to operate freely. Keep in mind that it sometimes takes the market a little while to adjust to new circumstances - it might even be a few years before we really see the impact of this kind of policy ripple out. But the end result is ultimately inevitable; the market will settle on an equilibrium point where the prices are as low as they can be while still generating a profit.

And if other nations simply refuse to behave, Trump is absolutely willing to enact these tariffs.  From a game theory perspective, his approach is the correct one.

But who knows its like 3am everyone is tired. But he needs to do more. And more importantly so does THIS thread. People need to come together and more crucially indulge in some reconciliation to a certain extent. This goes to both sides. Again I know this sucks coming from a \"cop out\" on the fence whatever you wanna call me. Im saying: gloating doesn't help. Show respect toward each other.

      "Hey there.  First off, despite what you might think about us, I promise we all love this country and just want the best for it.  We are not racist, sexist, violent, homophobic or anything else the media makes us out to be.  Sure there are outliers, as there are with every candidate.  Today, blacks, latinos, whites, men, women, etc. voted for Trump in large numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, there is still a lot of work to do.  Trump's plan is not about isolationism or hatred.  It's first and foremost about protecting Americans.  That means through security and monetary means.  He loves immigrants, he's married to one after all.  You just have to do it legally, it's only fair and safe for our citizens.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In Europe, the migrant crisis is a gigantic problem.  The FBI and CIA have said ISIS and other terrorist groups will infiltrate the program into America.  They already have in Europe.  How do we protect ourselves while also helping out the families trying to escape war? Temporarily disable immigration from terrorist hotbeds and develop a system to extremely vet people from there.  Obama did something similar in Iraq in 2011.  Once that system is in place, we will let them in legally.  In the meantime, we will help those wanting to escape war by building safe areas with our protection in neighboring countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as our economy, focusing on Americans.  Bringing jobs backs from overseas, negotiating better trade deals, lowering business regulations, less government involvement.  Obamacare is really hurting businesses especially this next year.  MAGA is taking what's working with our country and keeping it, and taking what's not working and changing it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there is the issue of corruption.  It permeates Washington.  People get positions based on how much money they donate. Special interests, Wall Street, lobbyists, banks all run Washington.  In the leaks we even see that Obama's administration was picked by a bank.  Giving people positions based on merit should be a start.\n",
      "\n",
      "All I can think of right now, but we can talk later when I'm not falling asleep in my chair!\n",
      "Thank you for your answer! I understand, and I recognize many of the \"bigots\" who support Trump are labeled as such by far left wingers who prevent logical and objective discussions to take place. My dad and I talked about it, and I realized he's pretty excited about a Trump presidency. After 9/11, Hillary apparently said that all Muslims should be placed in interment camps. She got the candidacy though corruption and lies, and she epitomizes the kind of shady politics you see in \"House of Cards\" (hopefully without all the murder). However, the things Trump had said haven't been too attractive either. But I see he's a gutsy motherfucker with a 10/10 wife, so we have a model as first lady ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞). \n",
      "\n",
      "It's going to be interesting to see a man run this country who is not bound to fulfilling the kickbacks and favors that fuels the corruption in Washington. He's seen money, so he doesn't need that. He has a very unique opportunity to do something great for this country. News outlets don't realize that many folks found out their medical insurance premiums increased, driving them to vote for Trump in order to repeal Obamacare. His 100 day plan is sensible, and doesn't contain anything racially divisive. If he wants to build a wall, go ahead. There are processes in place to obtain a citizenship legally. Therefore, I see why Trump can be a positive figure in the political system, objectively speaking. The far left is fucking nuts, and maybe they need a reality check. \n",
      "It's nice talking to someone who voted for Hillary that is not saying I am a \"racist homophobe bigot\" for voting Trump.  Refreshing really.  Not sure how Trump is either honestly.  The first 3 people announced to be in his administration are a gay man, a black man, and woman... yet the media tells us he hates those groups...  The best part is, it has nothing to do with those reasons (sure it helps).  But Ben Carson was the head of neurosurgeons at John Hopkins and an incredibly smart medical professional.  He's gonna be in charge of healthcare and replacing Obamacare.  Peter Thiel is a genius in the tech world, scouted Elon Musk and invested in him and started PayPal and helped invest in Facebook early.  He'll be in charge of technology and innovation (advisor) to Trump.  KellyAnne Conway helped Trump get elected, a guy who the entire media and world seemed to be against, with no backings and no help from either party, 95% of donations from the people, no help from PACs or special interests, and the biggest upset in political history.  She will be in his administration too.\n",

      "He's not even in office and here's what's happened: stock markets have never been higher in our history, Russia wants peace with us now in letter from Putin, Israeli president overjoyed, Egyptian and Philippines presidents overjoyed, Canada and Mexican leaders already announced they are willing to rework NAFTA, etc.  Because just a small threat from Trump holds weight.  With Obama, they knew they could get away with anything (line in the sand).  With Trump, if you don't do what you say, sorry too bad you're out.  The threat of knowing that will keep people in line.\n",

This election required voters to think critically; we had two very distinct choices for the first time in 40 years... and we won. My hope has been restored, my confidence in the country somewhat, and my personal confidence as someone who predicted he'd win in 2015 has been majorly, to the derision of my own family, who are mostly republican, totally restored. I'm contemplating taking another sick day. Many things went well for me today; I took it off mostly because I'm sooo bored at work, and always tired (I use little vacation or sick time); and because it was Election Day.  I wanted my happiness of not working karma to flow to trump. Not only did I fix a broken tool, I fixed a broken truck that sat idle in my yard for four months, and the COUNTRY WENT MAGA!  I've always wanted to run my own business: today has me feeling the confidence to do so!  I've been right now, more than I've been wrong. My family thought me crazy when I said Trump would win (way back in 2015 when he announced). Trump, however pitiful this sounds, has made me believe in myself again. I feel, under his presidency, my only hinderance to success is me. I can accept that. I cannot accept an oppressive government doctrine and be happy.\n",

But he sacrificed all of his wealth, his fame, and his lifestyle for his country. Throughout the election, Mr. Trump and his supporters were belittled by the mainstream media and even Hillary Clinton, who referred to Trump supporters as part of a \"basket of deplorables.\" Not that he isn't guilty of similar behavior directed at the other side, but Mr. Trump and his basket of deplorables has done the unthinkable. We have snatched the oval office from the hands of a candidate who has gone through what seems to be a 30-year-long spree of incompetency, scandal, and crime. From the establishment of the failed NAFTA deal and the intimidation/silencing of Mr. Clinton's sexual assault victims to the abandoning of four American heroes at Benghazi and the threatening of our national security by the use of a private server on which classified government information was distributed, we have single-handedly saved our great country from disaster.\n",

Speaking of police, law enforcement officers everywhere will be treated with the respect that they deserve. Black Lives Matter will be held accountable for their acts of domestic terrorism. Criminals will be treated like criminals, not \"victims\" of \"government oppression\", and held accountable for the crimes they commit. Hillary Clinton will finally be brought to justice for her crimes. Law and order will be restored. Judicial restraint will be applied in the Supreme Court. We will gain the upper hand in the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism. College students will be treated like adults as opposed to being treated like children, meaning that the end of the age of \"Safe Spaces\" and being offended by anything and everything that goes against certain viewpoints is upon us. Under Donald Trump, this country WILL BE GREAT AGAIN.\n",

His money, his reputation, and his good name up for grabs so he could try and right a wrong. He saw OUR America going down the tubes and believed he could do something about it... and he took the first step, he won. Now it's up to us to make sure he has the support of Congress. Oh I know you all thought the fight was over after they called Trump the winner, but it's just started. Remember, Trump called out the establishment, and told them he was coming after them, so I believe that without pressure from us, they will try and stop everything he wants to do.

He said operatives were everywhere and cheaters would be out and sent to prison. He'd already taken out the top players of dirty tricks and proven he was at lower levels when he exposed union bosses, smug donors at a fund raiser. All of this on the day before the election. Imagine their panic. Who would risk the humiliation and prison time to steal a few votes? Especially when the top guys aren't there to terrorize you into taking one for the team. Trump was very clever to set this up last year to neutralize the doc fraud machine at the very last minute. Plus he'd already made certain people were being hyper vigilant for fear Hillary would steal the election. Finally he'd made it Crystal clear that he would contest the election if he didn't win and there was even the hint of cheating. The doc knows very well that he LOVES taking crooks and cheats to court. They know he has vicious lawyers. They know the GOPe has famously effective lawyers. I believe all of this overwhelmed their operations across the country. \n",

I just couldn't understand why every time I tried to have a proper discussion, I was cast down as racist. If you act like a criminal you get treated like a criminal. I was beginning to think I was wrong, when all I found were anti police retaric and the MSM playing law and order like it was criminal. Then I found this sub and man I was so happy to find people who were willing to have proper discussions. News that showed both sides of the story. Thanks. LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Godspeed to you, and I wish you the very best dealing with all of that, Patriot!\n",

Google the picture of Trump, Rosa Parks and Ali standing together as recipients of the Ellis Island Freedom Award. He earned it for his work for inner city kids. Remind them Hillary plays old fashioned, hard ball politics. Politicians lie to win. They shouldn't actually believe what she said.

I didn't mean to do that to Hillary Clinton's husband but I'm literally in shock from his sexual advances. Why the fucking fuck is he trying to rape me? I know what he did with these cigars in the Oral Office. This can't be happening. Why is Joy Behar calling me a tramp?? I'm having a fucking breakdown! I don't want to believe Hillary supports and defends rapists like her husband. I want to remain a \"nerd virgin.\" I cannot fucking deal with this right now.

I always knew in the back of my mind, no matter how much I appeared optimistic on the outside, that this would always be an uphill battle. A classic david vs goliath battle. I convinced everyone I knew that Hillary wasn't the person they thought she was. I supported Trump openly and proudly. I just can't believe we've done it. It's unbelievably surreal. We helped put this man in the white house, and have reshaped the future of our nation, forever.

In the USA there are lots of alternative outlets at least - Breitbart, InfoWars, Drudge, ZeroHedge, etc., who can counter the mainstream media. That's why the mainstream media has gotten more and more shrill as they lose their grip on the American people.\n",

And though I disagree with some of his choices and ideas, I agree with others. The thing about Anti-Trump Norwegians (From my experience) is that they have no fucking clue what they are talking about. They straight up hate Trump, and when you ask them why, they usually answer something like \"Because he's an asshole\". It's kind of a trend to hate Trump here, so people actually don't care about the politics and just hate because others do. \n",

      "I'm actually majoring in environmental science and I plan to make a career out of it, and I'm a Trump voter. I have several reasons. First, Hillary would say anything to get elected and do nothing, she has lied so much that nothing she says can be taken as the truth. Her alliances lie with the special interests who funded her campaign and made her rich, including Saudi Arabia who is one of the biggest producers of oil in the world, and if you believe the conspiracy theories (which are just barely connected enough to make sense), they wanted an oil pipeline into Europe and the war in Syria is a proxy war to help make that happen, Russia is against it as they are the worlds second largest producer of natural gas behind us and would benefit from selling to Europe, she has been behind the keystone pipeline vigorously despite how her public stance on the matter changed, she has backed the TPP vigorously despite how her public opinion changed and countries that would benefit from the deal mostly produce goods by factories which are terrible for the environment, she would probably be bought out by the fracking industry anyways, so that wouldn't change, not to mention potential nuclear winter by blaming Russia for all her treason and hiding her corruption. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now that that's covered, onto Trump and what I believe he will do. Honestly I believe that we have bigger problems to deal with because we won't be able to do anything about the climate if we don't have a functional country anymore (although that's getting into other stuff), someone will always be there to dig up that coal, drill for that oil, extract that natural gas. In the end, my answer is that the earth will always be here, and I believe the best way people will learn and accept climate change is to learn from past mistakes, or else other people will just call into question your hypothetical scenarios.\n",

I would much rather prefer single payer, but I will keep an open mind. Thanks again for the reply.\n",

      "\n",
      "The beautiful thing about an open market system versus a single-payer system is this, which I think you'll like. The companies have to compete. That means no massive run-ups in price, which a single payer system encourages. You could see the beginnings of this with Obamacare - the insurance companies were raising their prices because they had no reason not to with the massive stipends and such. They were going to get paid no matter what because the government was going to give out as much money as people needed to be able to pay those prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a free market system, with competition across borders between ALL the companies, they will have to price their plans accordingly. This means that the people will get better prices, *and* the government will not be giving away huge amounts of money to make it affordable. Think of all the money that *won't* be flooding into the insurance companies - if there's one thing I think we can all agree on, it's that corporate executives make too much money!\n",

      "With insurance prices going down, the insurance companies will not be willing to pay as high of a price for the drugs because they aren't bringing in as much money from their customers. If the drug company wants to be able to sell their drugs, they have to price them at a point that the insurance companies will be willing to pay for people's prescriptions.\n",

      "I'm working on my MBA right now, a lot of this stuff is pretty simplified economics. There is a lot that goes into what happens in a market, but this is the general drift of things if the market is allowed to operate freely. Keep in mind that it sometimes takes the market a little while to adjust to new circumstances - it might even be a few years before we really see the impact of this kind of policy ripple out. But the end result is ultimately inevitable; the market will settle on an equilibrium point where the prices are as low as they can be while still generating a profit. Again, this might take time!\n",

And if other nations simply refuse to behave, Trump is absolutely willing to enact these tariffs.  From a game theory perspective, his approach is the correct one.  International trade is very much like the iterated prisoner's dilemma problem.  Our current and past politicians had a policy of unconditional cooperation, leaving us open for exploitation.

But who knows its like 3am everyone is tired. But he needs to do more. And more importantly so does THIS thread. People need to come together and more crucially indulge in some reconciliation to a certain extent. This goes to both sides. Again I know this sucks coming from a \"cop out\" on the fence whatever you wanna call me. Im saying: gloating doesn't help. Show respect toward each other.

We are not racist, sexist, violent, homophobic or anything else the media makes us out to be.  Sure there are outliers, as there are with every candidate.  Today, blacks, latinos, whites, men, women, etc. voted for Trump in large numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, there is still a lot of work to do.  Trump's plan is not about isolationism or hatred.  It's first and foremost about protecting Americans.  That means through security and monetary means.  He loves immigrants, he's married to one after all.  You just have to do it legally, it's only fair and safe for our citizens.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In Europe, the migrant crisis is a gigantic problem.  The FBI and CIA have said ISIS and other terrorist groups will infiltrate the program into America.  They already have in Europe.  How do we protect ourselves while also helping out the families trying to escape war? Temporarily disable immigration from terrorist hotbeds and develop a system to extremely vet people from there.  Obama did something similar in Iraq in 2011.  Once that system is in place, we will let them in legally.  In the meantime, we will help those wanting to escape war by building safe areas with our protection in neighboring countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as our economy, focusing on Americans.  Bringing jobs backs from overseas, negotiating better trade deals, lowering business regulations, less government involvement.  Obamacare is really hurting businesses especially this next year.  MAGA is taking what's working with our country and keeping it, and taking what's not working and changing it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there is the issue of corruption.  It permeates Washington.  People get positions based on how much money they donate. Special interests, Wall Street, lobbyists, banks all run Washington.  In the leaks we even see that Obama's administration was picked by a bank.  Giving people positions based on merit should be a start.\n",

      "Thank you for your answer! I understand, and I recognize many of the \"bigots\" who support Trump are labeled as such by far left wingers who prevent logical and objective discussions to take place. My dad and I talked about it, and I realized he's pretty excited about a Trump presidency. After 9/11, Hillary apparently said that all Muslims should be placed in interment camps. She got the candidacy though corruption and lies, and she epitomizes the kind of shady politics you see in \"House of Cards\" (hopefully without all the murder). However, the things Trump had said haven't been too attractive either. But I see he's a gutsy motherfucker with a 10/10 wife, so we have a model as first lady ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞). \n",
      "\n",
      "It's going to be interesting to see a man run this country who is not bound to fulfilling the kickbacks and favors that fuels the corruption in Washington. He's seen money, so he doesn't need that. He has a very unique opportunity to do something great for this country. News outlets don't realize that many folks found out their medical insurance premiums increased, driving them to vote for Trump in order to repeal Obamacare. His 100 day plan is sensible, and doesn't contain anything racially divisive. If he wants to build a wall, go ahead. There are processes in place to obtain a citizenship legally. Therefore, I see why Trump can be a positive figure in the political system, objectively speaking. The far left is fucking nuts, and maybe they need a reality check. \n",

      "LegendaryAmerican\n",
      "It's nice talking to someone who voted for Hillary that is not saying I am a \"racist homophobe bigot\" for voting Trump.  Refreshing really.  Not sure how Trump is either honestly.  The first 3 people announced to be in his administration are a gay man, a black man, and woman... yet the media tells us he hates those groups...  The best part is, it has nothing to do with those reasons (sure it helps).  But Ben Carson was the head of neurosurgeons at John Hopkins and an incredibly smart medical professional.  He's gonna be in charge of healthcare and replacing Obamacare.  Peter Thiel is a genius in the tech world, scouted Elon Musk and invested in him and started PayPal and helped invest in Facebook early.  He'll be in charge of technology and innovation (advisor) to Trump.  KellyAnne Conway helped Trump get elected, a guy who the entire media and world seemed to be against, with no backings and no help from either party, 95% of donations from the people, no help from PACs or special interests, and the biggest upset in political history.  She will be in his administration too.\n",

Not because of the color of their skin or their private parts (unlike Obama who Wikileaks showed picked people based on skin color or gender or big donors suggested by CitiBank who didn't have the necessary experience).\n",

      "He's not even in office and here's what's happened: stock markets have never been higher in our history, Russia wants peace with us now in letter from Putin, Israeli president overjoyed, Egyptian and Philippines presidents overjoyed, Canada and Mexican leaders already announced they are willing to rework NAFTA, etc.  Because just a small threat from Trump holds weight.  With Obama, they knew they could get away with anything (line in the sand).  With Trump, if you don't do what you say, sorry too bad you're out.  The threat of knowing that will keep people in line.\n",
