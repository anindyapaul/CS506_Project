damg7gq,,"I've honestly been thinking, and I think democrats need to start this example with Marijuana being a states rights thing, and move it to the rest of our partisan issues. Imagine if you take somewhere like california. You make pot legal, gay marriage legal, then you give them a state wide universal healthcare program, decriminalize drug abuse, and make state Colleges basically free for in state residents. Now imagine you do the same for all other blue states. A deal so enticing that people will move out of their red states to them. Or vote people into their red states who promise to do the same thing. Beat them at their own game, and soon the entire country is begging to be at the same point of progress. I think this is the key for democrats. Stop trying to force progress on a national level. Do it on a state level and watch the freedom of choice force them to the right. And if they chose to stay in their states than cool, at least the rest of us have places to live how we want to."

danamsz,Kaptep525,"[No, he said he would do it by cutting taxes on corporations, pulling out of NAFTA and other trade deals, and attempt to sanction countries that ""hurt American workers.""](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/trade), among other things. It's not a good plan, and it would take some magic to get it to work the way he wants to, but you can't say he's not said anything."
dan33ls,DylanRed,He also never said it wasn't going to be magic.
dananxl,Carrawr64,"Exactly, he never gave any plan and just said everything would be great. He promised greatness with no evidence that he could even support himself, loosing company after company and mooching millions upon millions from his father and calling it a ""small investment."" The only reason he's still rich (if he is, no one knows his financial situation) is because his dad still is. He doesn't understand how to do the one thing he's based his life on, bussiness. He litterally became President to further his own income and reputation. He's the entity of what I'd always imagined to be the most vile, racist, sexist, pervirted, abusive mound of owl pellets I could concieve, and somehow that became the President of the country I live in, and I couldn't be more ashamed. I'm sorry if you think that he could do anything to benifit us. Before this, Bernie was raising my hopes for humanity when I thought we were forsaken, but now I think it's all gone for good."

dan9n4k,nudeandrude01,"lol. Unfortunately, the Americans clinging on to these factory jobs are low skilled, or zero skilled, workers, who constantly want to take sick/medical leave, file union grievances, etc. because at the end of the day they are too lazy to develop their skill-set. Why wouldn't a company go to a place like Mexico, India, China, when those workers would be 100% more efficient and not pull all the b.s. these American factory workers do. The time for being an ""upstanding"" citizen and having absolutely 0 value but still getting paid is over. You need to earn your keep, otherwise, gtfo."
dan32i0,lcfparty15,"No, most of those people want what Trump is going to do, including the stuff you or I consider bad. I live in a small town in TN, have for 30+ years."
dan28ib,sweepminja,He already has with Carrier and Ford.
dan5t3m,newspaperaddict,"He did succeed with Carrier, but it seemed mostly symbolic to me. The deal saves only 1,000 jobs, which doesn't seem to be the full 1,400 the plant currently employs. It also essentially boils down to giving a business taxpayer money to keep them in the country. The real question to me is what substantial changes will his administration make to make manufacturing jobs thrive. [Also, Ford was never planning to move the jobs to another country.](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/19/business/ford-move-cited-as-victory-by-trump-has-no-effect-on-us-jobs.html)"
dan5vyf,sweepminja,"Deregulation and tax incentives. Also, he'll be gutting TTP and NAFTA. The thing is he said he would do something about Carrier and he did."
dan7dn2,newspaperaddict,"He won't be gutting either. He'll be withdrawing from them. And as the TPP (not TTP) is still only a proposed agreement, it won't change the current situation. Also, opinions are mixed on what effect the TPP would have on jobs and trade in the US."
dan90ul,Dcajunpimp,"Well Hillary quit calling TPP the gold standard.And she and Obama were promising rust belt union members they would renegotiate or scrap NAFTA 9 years ago if either became president.>SEN. CLINTON: I'm confident that as president, when I say we will opt out unless we renegotiate, we will be able to renegotiate.>MR. RUSSERT: Senator Obama, you did in 2004 talk to farmers and suggest that NAFTA had been helpful. The Associated Press today ran a story about NAFTA, saying that you have been consistently ambivalent towards the issue. Simple question: Will you, as president, say to Canada and Mexico, ""This has not worked for us; we are out""?>SEN. OBAMA: I will make sure that we renegotiate, in the same way that Senator Clinton talked about. And I think actually Senator Clinton's answer on this one is right. I think we should use the hammer of a potential opt-out as leverage to ensure that we actually get labor and environmental standards that are enforced. And that is not what has been happening so far.http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/26/us/politics/26text-debate.html?pagewanted=all"
danzpxr,newspaperaddict,"That's true. However, I've read that the TPP would effectively replace NAFTA, and as far as I know that is true. Maybe that was his solution rather than the difficult process of leaving NAFTA."
dan7td8,sweepminja,That's what I meant by gutting.
danzrc2,newspaperaddict,"Gutting to me means intense alterations and revisions, not withdrawing. But if that's what you meant, okay."
daoc75g,sweepminja,Does arguing with strangers on the internet over mute points... do anything for you?
daonwh6,newspaperaddict,"I'm not arguing with you, I was glad you clarified. And I assume you mean ""moot""."
dan8nzp,LugganathFTW,Oh yeah Trump saved the Ford plant **that was never going to close.** Real great job from our next president.
dan5bz1,,"yeah, lets pretend like bernie wasnt cheated and wouldnt have trounced trump. he would have helped every state more than trump."
damzpo7,occupythekitchen,He's keeping jobs and he has laid out 35% import tariffs and competitive corporate taxea
damzsf0,InvadedByMoops,> 35% import tariffsSo he's gonna start a trade war? Yeah good luck with that.
dan08t8,occupythekitchen,"This is actually standard industry protectionism and it's root date back to the industrial revolution. Many countries in the world do this in order to keep industries local. He already kept jobs here that were being exported and the great thing about it is small shops will be able to compete with stores such as Wal Mart which imports most of its goods. Companies either produce at home or they'll be out competed by local emerging industry. It's exciting in an economic point of view, lots of room for small business to emerge if the established industry remain abroad"
dan1tns,woolyboy76,"The only thing holding manufacturing companies back from full scale automation is that overseas labor is generally still cheaper than investing in robotics. However, the second overseas labor is no longer a viable option, you'll see a full scale embracing of robotics here in the US.Those manufacturing jobs aren't coming back."
dan2ek3,occupythekitchen,"I do production engineering, you are so wrong. Robotics is investment heavy and your cheap labor is replaced by expensive machinery which needs expensive specialists to operate and deal with problems and solutions. You also need people to prep ingredients and clean the machines, you need more space and robotics is not one machine does all. Yes machines are more effective for mass production but it's very difficult to automate a whole factory with current technology we are still decades away from complete automation. Most of automated machines do only one specific task a line of 100 robots is quicker than humans but the initial investment is 1000sx more expensive. You also forget human nature, do you think elderly people go to McDonald's for breakfast to be greeted by machines? You seriously underestimate humanity as a whole.There is another thing you forget the government is by the people for the people, if automation squeezes too many jobs we can tax their production or create ratios for machines/robots to humans. If we are going to automate factories we also don't want to do it for china but here because then we become exporters (meaning we bring money into the country) instead of importers (send money away). I honestly think you heard automation once and imagine what it is without knowing what it really is. Saying automation doesn't make you smart bubbaBy the way love your pessimism"
dan3ag9,woolyboy76,"Well, McDonalds just announced that they're starting the rollout of automated cashiers throughout the nation. And guess where they're starting? In areas that enacted higher minimum wages. In other words, once the cost of labor increased, that's the precise moment they decided to implement the automation they've been waiting to pull the trigger on."
dan3i4m,occupythekitchen,Good so you'll be able to first hand see elderly people reject that and people in general too. But guess what cooks will earn a living wage out of one job instead of two. McDonald's is also saying automation wrong as a scare tactic they'll have a screen for you to select your order and still hire a person to help people use the machines. That isn't true automation. True automation would be sitting on your table pressing a button and no human involved. Those stores will still have people
dan3y9m,woolyboy76,"Yes, but they'll have far fewer people. Which is exactly the point. And a few years after that, they'll have even fewer people.And, I really don't see people giving a crap if they order their $1.50 McDonalds cheeseburger from a screen. People want stuff cheap. They can't afford to take a stand. And that will be especially true if they can't get a job."
dan4gle,occupythekitchen,That's not a good thing though impoverish the people to justify automation. It really feels counter intuitive. Again i am saying this is most likely the extent of automation McDonald's will do now but you have to remember the corporation doesn't own every franchise a lot of people who own McDonald's won't be willing to invest on those machines unless the Corp pushes and subsidizes them. I have seem then in use at some stores over 10 years ago. They still employ people to help and hand out cups call out orders cook etc. I stand by my comment their threat is to scare people by making it seem they will automate the whole store which simply is not true.
dan8pxw,LugganathFTW,Lol. It's going to be a sad wake-up call in 4 years when we're far from an American manufacturing golden age.
dani9ka,occupythekitchen,Honestly America is in a sad state now.
dan0ery,shaggorama,"> 35% import taxHe'd better also raise the minimum wage then, because the prices for regular commodities are going to spike.> competitive corporate taxesThere's a big difference between bringing back factories and bringing back jobs. Those jobs are gone. New factories are going to have new technology in them, which means significant automation. Bringing back industry (which Trump can't guarantee will happen to begin with) is not the same as bringing back jobs. Those corporate tax breaks are just going to line the pockets of the people who own those companies."
dan0vtu,occupythekitchen,So import the robots too? Honestly you sound clueless about economics those taxes are not to raw goods but to assembled goods. Automation will just create a new niche for human workers not displace all humans. I doubt we are close to having robots replace every single job....yeah they can replace waiters and cashiers take Walmart for example one human for every 4 self check out where usually they only have 10 of 40 cash registers open. Same amount of jobs
dan26sv,,"It's closer to 1 human for every 20 self checkouts, and the more reliable they get the less they'll need people per register"
dan31q9,occupythekitchen,That will be a mess. So much stole merchandise and poor people working those jobs. They have a person per 4 to deter larceny not because it's effective. Do you even think?
dan5ee6,,Depends on how many people steal vs. how much it costs to pay multiple humans min wage+ benefits. If someone gets hurt and they're paying disability I bet Walmart would have rather someone stolen a package of peeps.
dan64jf,occupythekitchen,Your scenario involves a world with a lot of jobless people so a lot of theft and manufacturing is not even in the u.s. so massive government debt.
dan2e01,woolyboy76,"Bus drivers, truck drivers, and pilots will all be replaced. All retail jobs and fast food jobs gone. Teaching will become a part time profession as students get more of their education via personalized software. Manufacturing will continue to be automated more and more. Accountants and bookkeepers. Gone. Paralegals gone. Pretty much any clerical job. Gone.Do you really think all these jobs will be replaced by developers and robot repairmen?"
dan2zcc,occupythekitchen,"You really think no one will supervise those activities. Waiters and service people will be replaced until there is demand to be served by people, places like Hooters will never go robotic. We are still decades away from full automation and any accident with any of your automated example will set progress back decades. Yes eventually those things will be common but we are far away from those days. Remember people vote so just like the people spoke when they elected trump demanding jobs back they'll also vote to limit automation. That's what societies do, they have each other's back.I for one will never go to an automated fast food restaurant because I can make a difference"
dan3mq6,woolyboy76,"It won't happen all at once. My brother is a pilot. He thinks we're 7 to 8 years from eliminating first officers. Then, the automated pilot will take over with the human captain essentially becoming the backup in case of emergency. 10 years after that, once the public is comfortable with the idea of an automated pilot, the human backup will be eliminated all together.Whether it takes 10, 20 or 30 years, the result is the same. There will be a massive elimination of jobs in a very short period of time, and the new types of jobs created to support that automation will be incredibly high skilled jobs."
dan3wim,occupythekitchen,Piloting is already highly automated landing and lift off are the most human engagement parts. As you said the idea of not having a pilot is scary. It's a generational gap pilotless planes is still 50+ years away most flyers are older no way they'll like that but who's to say we will be flying in planes in 50 years. SpaceX could launch us to low earth orbit and then descend to our destination here in 50 years making travel time a lot shorter so then pilots are organically replaces by something new. Either way because automation is coming doesn't mean we should just give up our industries.
damm4uj,emokneegrow,85% of the votes in my county went to Trump. I'd need a few thousand clones to make a difference.
damy3z9,blorgbots,"Whoa, whoa! Let's not get extreme! You could just kidnap a few thousand people and brainwash them"

dan2vlw,Rustyastro,1 out of every 3 people in your county didn't vote for Trump. That's a start.
damzwwq,Cornthulhu,"How do you propose to do that? The state is red because everyone there votes Republican, not because liberal candidates don't exist. Short of some insanely orchestrated move by liberals to move out of cities and into rural counties (which would never happen because job availability,) you'd have a hard time turning these red states blue. You can't just take a crayon and make a state blue."

damjmg2,,"It was tough for people to move to America during the Irish potato famine too. In fact it was arguably much harder. doesn't mean it didn't happen in mass. People left starving, dying and sick with almost no money. They left their families to never be seen or heard from again. You won't leave Tennessee cuz you don't make enough, skyping isn't personal enough, and traveling is a small burden. Jeez man people are right. We're a soft ass generation."
damlu06,hotpajamas,"these people you describe had nothing left to lose and everything to gain. when people are dying of starvation in tennessee, people will move."

I'd rather wait a few years and attempt to get a career on the ground."
dan6biq,,Lol I'm a transplant in OKC from DC. I know exactly what you're talking about. I honestly wish this state would throw more funding towards schools. They're so bad out here.
dan6f9h,dandaman0345,"Oh, we almost had a chance to make some improvements on our schools too! Well, at least I can drown my sorrows in cold 6-point beer soon."
dan6piu,,"Lol right? Like the fact that you've brought in all these energy companies, and still don't have money for schools is so dumb. I hear that some schools are even cutting down to 4 day weeks to save money. The whole thing is incredibly sad."
dan7cw3,dandaman0345,"Yeah, my old high school is one of them and it wasn't even that poor of an area. I don't even know how the poorer school to the south of my old town is doing. They've had four day weeks for seven years.My friend actually moved to D.C. about six months ago, and he says that when he describes some of this stuff to people they look at him like he fled a third-world country."
dan7s5j,,"Seriously dude it's crazy. Like I grew up with arts programs from a very young age. Early exposure at a young age to band, orchestra, and choir for everyone. And not only encouraged in schools, but with auxiliary programs by the state. It's crazy that you come out here and see people who've never even touched an instrument until their teenage years, and that was of their own personal ambition. Here you don't have these programs, but shit you don't even have teachers. The amount of Teach for America volunteers I've met over the past 3 years of being here is insane. The vector for these kids intelligence will always be stunted from a lack of an enriched early education. Not that they're dumb, but they'll never be as smart as they could be. I love the improvements that have been made to downtown, but I really think there needs to be a redistribution of money back to these schools."
dan8ja1,dandaman0345,"Absolutely. It honestly fills me with rage every time I see an education bill get voted down. The teachers here make jack shit nothing and yet we can afford to give oil companies 600 million in tax cuts and rebates while they fuck the earth and lube up fault lines. Unfortunately, we've been sold bootstraps mythos for so long that the poor here don't even think it's the companies' fault. There's always someone poorer than themselves to blame instead. You know, it was an insanely long time ago, but this state used to be a bastion for socialists of all people. I bet there are a lot of skeletons spinning in a lot of graves around here."
dan0ou1,,Young men in rural Australia travel. Ive met a lot here in America. A lot of them are 'tradies' and are carpenters or 'sparkies' aka electricians. The difference is they learn it from high school and make like $30/hour or more.

damyfd6,RedOtkbr,"There it is! Bravo, good sir"
dan2sdq,throw6539,"Ehh, I don't know...that was a very different time, with very different laws, and it was under very different circumstances. The parent comment was merely stating that it's sometimes very hard to change your circumstances when the money you earn doesn't afford you the ability to try to make your future elsewhere. I think what they were saying is that it's nearly impossible to pick up stakes and move to an area with better opportunity and higher paying jobs when you're just barely making ends meet. When you're literally living hand to mouth, there is no surplus to afford the costs of relocation. On a side note, when you said that this generation was soft, what generation were you referring to? I have no idea what age the commenter was, but I'm curious how old you assume he/she is, and which age ranges you deem as soft. For the record, I don't entirely disagree with you, I'm just genuinely curious."
dan1bnx,altiuscitiusfortius,Theres plenty of lower to lower middle class people in the rural areas of those states. Not everywhere is Manhattan and LA.
dan5dvy,dandaman0345,"I'm not the person you responded to, but if he's anything like me, he probably wants to go to the cooler part of the state he's moving to. Sure, rural Colorado is better than rural Oklahoma, but I'm saving up while paying off loan debt and going through the trouble of finding a job hundreds of miles away. I don't want to do all that so that I can live in some prairie town that wishes it would be annexed by Kansas."
dan7dfy,altiuscitiusfortius,"That makes sense. I'm in a similar situation. I get paid literally 45% more to do my job in rural northern Canada then I would get paid if I moved to a big city like Vancouver. Half the wage and twice the expenses, so I cant justify it, but I would also like to live in a cool city. And yeah, the job hunt is brutal if you don't live in that city. Ive been there before to.It is harder then I made it sound in my original post, I agree."

Such as medical visitation and powers of attorney. In direct contradiction to full faith and credit."
damohir,weirdbiointerests,"All states have same-sex marriage now, but the issue of the clause's application to same-sex marriages was never resolved and DOMA contradicted the clause."
damurjd,BecauseFeelz,"I believe /u/tempest_87 was referring to the issue that before federal legalization of gay marriage, states without SSM would deny rights to same sex spouses, in contradiction to FF&C."
danbpym,Vehlin,"And he's saying that because the application of that clause wasn't tested by the supreme court you had DoMA. FF&C was seen as the wrong fight because while it would have forced states to recognise SSM, it wouldn't have made them carry them out. Forcing recognition would have been seen as ""enough"" and you'd have never had the federal law being put in place to legalise it."
damvr81,waaarg,"There are no states without same-sex marriage, and haven't been for 17 months. You're correct that they *used* to do this, before Obergefell v. Hodges. And that was because of a federal law that explicitly allowed them to do so: the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Obergefell v. Hodges also ruled that law unconstitutional for the exact reasons you're arguing."
damx8pl,Ksavye,"What people forget about the full faith in credit clause is that, yes what you receive in one state, ID, Contract, etc has to be honored in very state as if it were your own. The state that you move to does not have to honor your ""whatever it may be"" in there state if they have a law against it. So for example; You can go get married in Boston and your hometown is in Louisiana. Once you come back to Louisiana your Gay marriage is no longer valid or honored by the Louisiana government because hey have a law strictly against it. So that's how those situations typically happen. TLDR; The full faith and credit clause does not force a state to honor what you did in another state if they have a law against it."

damr1r5,pepedelafrogg,"That was part of the argument in Obergefell. States were denying marriages that Full Faith and Credit should have made them recognize, even while they recognized heterosexual marriages performed in the other states. That violated both FF&C and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment."
damo6fa,nixonrichard,"The full faith and credit clause says Congress defines what exactly is covered. If I have a concealed carry permit in Utah, that doesn't mean my permit to carry a concealed weapon is recognized in California. Same goes for any other sort of licensing. My liquor license and my license to practice law do not necessary work in other States.Marriage isn't really well-regulated by the federal government. If one State legalizes incestuous marriage, my marriage to my own brother may be a criminal offense in another State."

Why do California Democrats feel the need to interfere with Texas state policies?Regarding people who vote Republican but don't mind legal abortion. Those people realize abortion isn't very important comparatively, and they are voting for the superior (in their opinion) fiscal policies of the Republican Party. Some people think these social policies should drive our vote, many disagree.FYI, abortion isn't a religious issue for many people. You don't have to be religious to believe theft is wrong, even though religion says theft is wrong. The vast majority of people believe late term elective abortions are wrong. They draw the line at 6 months? And someone who draws the line at 5 months, 4 months, 1 month, or 1 day suddenly needs religion as a reason? That doesn't make sense."

Whether it is a matter of women's rights or not is clearly what is debatable. You agree that late term abortions are a human rights issue against the baby. Don't you see that someone else could feel the same way about a week 6 abortion?Back to the wacky tendency, Americans actually apply that worldwide, and especially within the United Nations. There are levels to what we consider worth pushing regarding human rights at the state, USA, UN, and world levels. Do you think we should push for legal abortions throughout the UN? If not, why not? If so, what about the entire world?I agree there are some people on the right who believe that abortions should be banned throughout the USA, and those people are most likely driven by religious reasons. I don't agree that the people who want a state to decide for itself are necessarily religious. On a side not, but not too important, why does it matter to you if their reason is religious? If I told you theft was wrong, and I wont change that conviction because of my religion, does that make my opinion invalid to you? You may make up your might on a question of right vs wrong based on whatever branch of metaphysics seems correct to you, but what argument do you have against those who subscribe to a different philosophy, and why is that argument any better or worse than someone whose convictions come from religion?>Those trying to ban it aren't doing so because it would be fiscally responsible. They want to ban it for religious reasons. It isn't a states' rights issue.For me, it is a states rights issue. I have no religious issue, but I support states rights. If my state wants legal abortions, I'm supportive of that decision. If my state bans abortions, I don't think the federal government should be able to stop it. I'm not playing devil's advocate, I'm actually an example of what you say doesn't exist."

danuu5a,dorekk,"Right but you were saying ""it would be great if it was illegal in most places."" Nationwide, weed is technically illegal federally, but just the states in the west *alone* that have legalized it (medicinal or recreational) make up 20% of the US population. Those states include conservative strongholds like Arizona and Montana, as well as Nevada (which is a purple state). And that's *just* in the west. There are numerous other states, red and blue, that have legalized it and could technically be shut down by federal authorities. It would be political *suicide* to enforce federal marijuana laws on a large scale. It won't happen. By state law, it's legal in most places and it will continue to be legal."

We will build on effective models of drug courts, veterans' courts, and other diversionary programs that seek to give nonviolent offenders opportunities for rehabilitation as opposed to incarceration.>Because of conflicting federal and state laws concerning marijuana, we encourage the federal government to remove marijuana from the list of “Schedule 1"" federal controlled substances and to appropriately regulate it, providing a reasoned pathway for future legalization. We believe that the states should be laboratories of democracy on the issue of marijuana, and those states that want to decriminalize it or provide access to medical marijuana should be able to do so. We support policies that will allow more research on marijuana, as well as reforming our laws to allow legal marijuana businesses to exist without uncertainty. And we recognize our current marijuana laws have had an unacceptable disparate impact in terms of arrest rates for African Americans that far outstrip arrest rates for whites, despite similar usage rates.**Republican:**>The progress made over the last three decades against drug abuse is eroding, whether for cultural reasons or for lack of national leadership. In many jurisdictions, marijuana is virtually legalized despite its illegality under federal law. At the other end of the drug spectrum, heroin use nearly doubled from 2003 to 2013, while deaths from heroin have quadrupled. All this highlights the continuing conflicts and contradictions in public attitudes and public policy toward illegal substances.

damu9hr,Fifteen_inches,and you believe that Hillary would make pro-marijuana appointments? she wouldn't. she is open anti-legalization. neither party is pro-legalization. In liberal bastions like Mass the Government was completely against recreational legalization. they were against medical legalization too and purposefully took years to give out permits for medical dispensaries. The government doesn't want us to have Marijuana.
damugyn,stansteamer,"Clearly illustrated by the last eight years of progression in drug legalization, and the democratic party stance quoted above, and Obama's statements today (and in the past).Could they do more? Sure. Have they done more wrt legalization in the last eight years than ever before in the history of the country? Yep."
damungs,dstz,"Democrats rushed past the five stages of grief in about 4 days. Republicans and Trump voters will deal with this shit for 4 years. And now, it's denial."
damv02v,stansteamer,Already seeing it. Denial that he's filling his cabinet with neo-nazis. Denial he chose an establishment treasurer. Denial that his new AG **won't** respect state rights. This is clear as day to the rest of us - I'm betting they will never admit it. No matter how many years go by.
damvnqk,,Denial? We are loving it!
damvolo,stansteamer,Exactly.
damwkmn,eximil,Might I ask what you like about his appointments so far? They (to me) seem antithetical to his campaign promises.
dan6b8v,,"They are neo-nazi's, part of the establishment and they won't respect state rights. Just as i voted for."
dan7kv2,eximil,/s?
dan7tzz,,"No i'm serious. I mean haven't you watched the news? I voted for a sexist, racist and a con man and so did the rest of the country. So him electing more racist white men who secretly want to make other white rich people more richer is great for me.I'm white and rich, and gonna be even richer."
dan8cyz,eximil,"Well, at least you're honest about it. I wholeheartedly disagree with you, but you did vote according to your beliefs."
damv06d,Fifteen_inches,">Clearly illustrated by the last eight years of progression in drug legalizationwhich, every single one was a ballot initiative. > and the democratic party stance quoted abovewhich is not binding, if it was Repubs would be actually downsizing the government and helping the white working class.>Obama's statements today (and in the past).who has supreme executive authority to reschedule or deschedule Marijuana>Could they do more? Sure.they could do literally anything besides blowing smoke>Have they done more wrt legalization in the last eight years than ever before in the history of the country? Yep.literally all they do is chest thump and do nothing to actually work towards legalization. MA government, for example, was completely against legalization."
damv3lq,stansteamer,"Nothing you said changes the truth in my statement. We are further along now, then ever before. Watch what happens in the next four years. You're going to feel like a fool. I'm going to save this."
damul7q,higher_than_lagrange,So you are just going to ignore the fact that Hillary was clearly more anti-pot than Trump. In a conversation where we are talking about the president's position and influence on the matter. Some of your arguments might matter if the DNC put up someone who actually had a pro-pot position.
damusez,stansteamer,"Are you ever going to move past the fact that Hillary lost the election? She is a non-candidate. You will never see her again. Move on. We are talking about President Trump. The guy who lied and told you he would honor state rights and then elected an establishment anti-pot person to Attorney General who will likely fight to make it federally illegal again. p.s. Hillary would have left it to the states and her cabinet would have pushed for decriminalization / rescheduling. Since it's irrelevant *because she is*, I'll leave it in this p.s."
damvoxt,grayarea69,You realize the left MSM is the propaganda arm of the Government per NDAA 2012 ..Thanks Obama.
damxi2v,AlwaysDefenestrated,You addressed literally zero of their points.
damznsn,jester92800,"I actually disagree with /u/grayarea69 here insomuch as I don't think that /u/stansteamer 's argument is influenced by propaganda-- I think he has a right to be worried about Sessions with regards to marijuana legalization because of his historical position on the issue-- all of which was on the record pre-NDAA2012.HOWEVER, what Grayarea is responding to is Stan's comment ""Literally everyone except your propaganda poisoned mind knows this"". His point is that this is a dangerous assertion to make, as the NDAA2012 legislation makes it legal for government agencies to manipulate and directly disseminate media which is designed to influence american public opinion on an issue. What he's trying to say -- I think -- is that we should all be a little more cognizant of the motives of the media we consume, and try to take in a broad spectrum of opinions before jumping to 'the sky is falling' conclusions, and certainly before lobbing adhoms at each other."
dan0541,stansteamer,Fair assessment. I agree and will remove the unnecessary adhom.
dan0gpf,grayarea69,mhm. also got a degree in this shit and interned..and well..influenced opinion with no regard for ethics...and got paid.
dan2arj,shamSmash,"Not exactly a high bar you're setting there....And any progress we've made has had nothing to do with Obama or national Democrats. All of the recreational states were passed by referendum not normal legislature. Obama did literally nothing in either way for the legalization movement. Sure he said a few words back in 2014, but by and large he hasn't used his presidential power in support of legalization. He hasn't done anything to hurt it though either, to be fair.The progress you speak of is almost entirely due to the power of states rights, and to normal Americans who got the ball rolling."
damv83h,pro_tool,"We will never know what Hillary would have done. But there is clear evidence that the new Republican cabinet is sincerely anti-drugs in general, and that the democrats have been the only party in recent history to provide any progress in regards to marijuana (INCLUDING THE LEGALIZATION OF TWO WHOLE STATES)."
dan1bw0,ygltmht,"We know exactly what Hillary would have done. Did you not see the email where she told Wall Street she would keep it ""illegal in every sense of the word?"""
damvpmv,Fifteen_inches,"the local democrat establishment was against legalization in Massachusetts, it only got through do to overwhelming popular support. we had to put in a ticking clock in ours because they were going to drag their feet with issuing commercial licences like they did with Medical"
damzxs2,terrasparks,Sincerely? Please. The word is brazenly.
damzv7n,gak001,"Her campaign came out in favor of rescheduling marijuana. You're operating on incorrect or outdated information. Marijuana legalization was on track for a steady forward march under continued Democratic control, but Trump's appointments are religiously opposed to legalization and almost certainly going to crack down."
damnvdr,1LT_Obvious,"Considering Trump is the one picking the the most anti-weed people possible for positions that will have the most impact on legalization and Hillary's campaign helped put together the 2016 Democratic party platform, I'm going to disagree with you. Yes, I'm positive that Hillary was against legalization in the past, but if her position had changed, which the evidence would heavily suggest, then that should be acknowledged. Trump may not vocally be against legalization and he may have stated support for state's rights, but actions speak louder than words."
damstpi,hawtfabio,Have you seen Trump's cabinet and AG? They are the opposite of pro-marijuana.
damsvtl,,Are they the opposite of leaving it to the state?
damt6ei,GrandeMentecapto,Yes. They want the federal government to ban it everywhere
damwu3k,theregoesanother,"What??? But GOP is supposed to be pro states right, small govt, and freedom??"
damte5h,stansteamer,"How are you so ignorant to what is going on? You do know who Jeff Sessions is, right?"
damu1q6,codygooch,There's no reason to be rude to him. There are those who don't have time to digest all of his appointments and keep themselves straight too.
damunub,Sebatinsky,>There are those who don't have time to digest all of his appointmentsBut that's not who /u/gotovoat5342 is.
dan0k1k,Infinity2quared,Fuck off with your bullshit. He nominated fucking Jeff Sessions. He personally probably doesn't give a shit--that's what he was claiming back in the 90s--but his personal opinion doesn't matter when his policy decisions are running the opposite way.He's amoral. He doesn't have an ideology. He'll do whatever seems convenient for him. And it's currently convenient for him to fuck over Americans by cowtowing to the Republican platform on the drug war and taking the money of all of the industries that desperately want to keep weed illegal and keep people in prisons for it.
damvvdk,Cuw,She did not say she wanted to keep it illegal... she said she wanted to see how it worked in the states that decriminalized and move to federal legislation if enough states had decimalized during that time she would push for rescheduling for research. But you can make shit up the election is over and facts clearly don't matter.
damw8t5,,"She said that she wanted more studies done before changing anything (so... keep it illegal in the mean time). She said she wanted to reschedule it to schedule 2 drug (like cocaine...), which means it's still illegal but you're allowed to study it. She said in private conversations with donors (I'm giving you the context as well as it was given to her so you know what she's actually saying):> URSULA BURNS: long means I support, short means I don't. I'm going to start with — I'm going to give you about ten long-shorts.> URSULA BURNS: You can answer short, but you got to be careful about letting anybody else know that. They will bet against you. So legalization of pot?> SECRETARY CLINTON: Short in all senses of the word.And of course, she then had to... be careful letting anyone else know that..."
damx6bw,neutrino71,Let's be honest the facts didn't matter much before the Election either.
damw7um,phildaheat,"Wtf?! You think Trump the guy who fucking called protests and riots being caused by people doing drugs, the guy who picked ""I'd like the KKK if they weren't pro-weed"" Sessions as AG wants to make pot a State issue??? How far down does your head have to be in the sand for you to believe that"
damv2k7,pro_tool,"Have you seen the people Trump has been recruiting? The most Anti-EVERYTHING people possible, ESPECIALLY when it comes to drugs. And seeing as how during Trumps campaign he said such extreme and outlandish shit that completely contradicted his written platform, I'm honestly shocked that anyone would think the best step forward for the legalization of pot would be a Trump presidency."
dan1abr,Jacob_wallace,"It's funny how everybody likes to hate on Trump, but it's all the mainstream republicans that are the real threat."
dan1ccw,,"I actually agree. I was happy that Trump win, but having Republicans win the house and Senate? That's the real threat."
daoyqrj,Jacob_wallace,"Republicans in the house and senate is what made me lose a lot of faith in America. Voting in Trump was just the result of the DNC pushing the worst pile of trash they ever could. The house and senate though, that's the result of people being blind to politics and not seeing those obstructionist fools for what they are."
damuuq2,BecauseFeelz,Calling Trump a republican is barely fair in this conversation. He's been a literal maverick his whole campaign.
damvkdz,1LT_Obvious,He's certainly not filling his administration with mavericks.
damvpsj,BecauseFeelz,"He's not, but then again we've criticized every single thing he's done since he started gaining traction, calling them stupid and ineffective, and yet here we are.So were republicans duped by a non-republican they voted for? Or now is he the republican everyone hates? Is he going to do what he said, or did he lie to everyone?Just pointing out the fact that he is against regulation, and the DEA is a HUGE money-sink failed regulatory agency, that I imagine he heavily despises."
damx0h6,Chip085,"> So were republicans duped by a non-republican they voted for? Or now is he the republican everyone hates?Mike Pence IS the Republican everyone hates, and Mike Pence is the guy a lot of people seem to think is calling shots now and for the next four years."

damvwr2,1LT_Obvious,I guess time will tell.
damxu4f,ILoveMeSomePickles,>He's been a literal maverick his whole campaign.TIL Trump is considered unbranded livestock.
damyd3p,kerouacrimbaud,Platforms don't mean anything really. They just pay lip service to the fringes.
damyo3t,1LT_Obvious,They give a good idea of where the party's general mindset is.
damz1ud,mightystegosaurus,"Well, they give a good idea of how the party wants people to think their general mindset is.It doesn't say how they really are, though. The parties - both of them - are lying bags of poop."
damzanh,1LT_Obvious,"I'll believe it when Trump or his administration do something to help legalization. So far though, things are looking exactly like the platform lays out. Trump knew exactly who he was picking for AG when he decided Sessions was the best man for the job."
dan3b51,mightystegosaurus,"My point was more in the other direction; I do not believe HRC would have lifted a finger - ever - to do anything to assist legalization. Her pockets were too bulging with pharmaceutical cash to do anything else.Trump is a big unknown who might start shouting ""You're Fired!"" at his AG and others as time passes and they begin to displease him - so, who knows with him."
dan4p78,1LT_Obvious,"I don't think she would do anything drastic, but I think she would have continued to let states decide. More and more would vote to legalize it. Once a large enough amount had legalized it, the DOJ would start rolling back on the federal ban until it was finally legalized nationwide. HRC wouldn't have to do shit except stay out of the way until the very end when she just has to go ""Welp, looks like the country has decided. Have fun, stay safe.""But, no, instead we get a president who wants to fill his cabinet with people who still believe reefer madness propaganda. He's doing everything *but* personally coming out against it, and I can't imagine we'd be having these problems with the people HRC would have filled her cabinet with."
dan0jco,YesNoMaybe,Which fringes are important. They aren't random.

damovv0,Lifeform604,"Ok, then remember that Obama was against legalization at the federal level until it was too late for him to actually do anything and he wanted to make a meaningless gesture on his way out the door by voicing support he never put in practice."
damrn9r,rdee3,"You can argue he's against it and you'd be right, but he was otherwise neutral when it came to action and it allowed states to progress their own legalization laws. Not something he really deserves credit for, but not something to be credited against either."
damu1p7,Konraden,"It's something Obama can take credit for. As the head of the Executive branch, it's his duty and power to enforce federal laws. He chose to no longer have the DEA aggressively pursue anti-marijuana policies and raids in states that have legalized it to any degree."
damvcur,rdee3,"Right, but if those states never pursued legalization he'd have minded his own business and there'd be no legalization. All he did was step aside. It's about as minimal credit as one should get."
damwbjn,phildaheat,Which is different than being against something as you initially claimed
damwtxh,rdee3,"I'm not claiming it, Obama is. Claiming he's against legalization requires him to do nothing, it's already illegal. The states are the ones pushing for legalization."
dandx3d,DrakkoZW,The president is the top level of the executive branch.The executive branch is tasked with enforcing the law.*Not enforcing the law* is basically one of the strongest ways the president can support something that is otherwise llegal
damxzza,phildaheat,You can't just claim that somebody is against something just because they don't support somethingOnly a Sith deals in absolutes...
damy74z,Chakra5,"I must disagree. Having the power to stop a thing, and not doing so, is in and of itself a powerful decision, and the act of an adult.It was actually the exact right thing to do."
dan14xt,MURICCA,">Right, but if those states never pursued legalization he'd have minded his own business and there'd be no legalizationI mean isnt that how its supposed to work"
damxbhw,vangogh88,"Nope. >Over the course of Obama's first term as president, his administration spent nearly $300 million on marijuana enforcement in states where medical cannabis had already been legalized.>During Obama's first term as president, his administration oversaw 270 dispensary raids on medical marijuana dispensaries.>Between 2009 and 2013, President Obama's administration spent $100 million more cracking down on medical marijuana dispensaries than George W. Bush's did.So glad you guys are paying attention to what politicians are doing now you've decided Trump is Satan. Smooth-talking cool guy dad jeans Obama pulled the wool over all of your eyes for 8 years."

danfdr1,Lifeform604,"Clearly he does, since he keeps commenting about it."
damvbex,Drum_Stick_Ninja,He could only do so much in his couple of terms. He knew he couldn't over step otherwise too much could be thrown away. He is after all the first modern president to admit to smoking marijuana. He has always been criticized.

damqugp,TheArtofPolitik,"He was actually for gay marriage as a private citizen and local legislator until his run for national office made the position less than tenable. As a gay person who lived in his state when he was Senator and who also knows well what the climate was regarding LGBT folk and the position of pro gay marriage, i don't blame him, and it's disingenuous for you to suggest his position was opportunistic. If one wants to be successful in politics, standing up for the right things at the wrong time is not a good strategy."
damr2lp,,[deleted]
damrcuc,TheArtofPolitik,"Because he was a law professor. Barack Obama has a pretty wide amount of reviewable material with speeches and positions, and his positions prior to being a national figure were pretty clear. This is why a lot of progressives were sp disappointed in him, because he was a pretty unabashed progressive at one point, but as it does for many people when they run for national office, idealism is usually pretty quickly quashed by the political realities and the fact you can't just yell your way into people accepting your views."

damr1xh,chreis,You can't be a winning politician and hold beliefs that are antithetical to voters'.Politicians have opinions they can't say aloud until the country has proven that they will accept them.

damsf3t,chreis,"I'll take people coming around to truth and decency in whatever way is possible for them to get there.

dan1843,MURICCA,"ExactlyThis is why redditors arent politicians, lmao"
damrjdl,iHasABaseball,"Because he's a politician. And a smart one at that. His evolution on the issue was tactical, not malicious or opportunistic. As was the entire DNC's position on same sex marriage. The intention being to move it away from being such a divisive partisan issue until there was enough support to push it across the finish line. And people are quick to forget just how quickly gay rights have moved. Much of Europe didn't even legalize until the early/mid 2000s."
damqew1,jarsnazzy,Yay democrats!
damtb30,truth__bomb,Not totally true. He and Eric Holder largely ended federal marijuana policing in terms of individual citizens' medical and recreational use.
danfd94,Lifeform604,"There was never much federal investigation of individual users in the first place, with the possible exception of some having it shipped to them through the mail."
dan6ai0,Effectx,Remember when changing your opinion on a subject based on new information was commendable?
danfagg,Lifeform604,"What significant new information did he get just now, when it is too late for him to actually do anything?"
danftyj,Effectx,"Who knows, it may have not been new information. Maybe it was he just thought about it for awhile and realized that his original stance was wrong? Would you rather he continue to support the idea that marijuana be criminalized for the rest of his life? Him changing his stance on the subject is a good thing."
danfwt1,Lifeform604,"I'd rather he just shut up and walked away, rather than trying to make an issue he avoided a problem for the next guy in line. It just looks like more petty partisan sniping."
danfxee,Effectx,"I disagree. Doing what he did is the right thing to do, better late than never."
dan6hvv,whirlpool138,He ordered the DEA to lay off of dispensaries and states that voted to legalize it. What more do you want? The President doesn't have the authority to change laws like that.

dampohg,YOU_SMELL,"You know that to run for office you need thousands of people doing work for you, you can't even get on the ballot in every state unless you do specific things and meet requirements in every state.

damt9rf,futuregovworker,"Actually you don't need a thousand people to work for you. It's pretty simple. You can either run in a smaller town and go door to door, or you can organize events for the community and get your name out, events of that nature usually has volunteers. You do not need any special requirements, you need a degree and an understanding of what you'll be doing. You need to have an end goal in mind. Now I'm not going to tell you my ideas or ways of getting elected but I can assure you I will be running for a state office and then work my way up. It's not meant to happen over night, it's a process. And yes you do decide how tax money is spent because well that's the workings of it isn't it? You fund things, change things, and hopefully in the end you have something that is worth having. Not all ideas are meant to be the 'best'. But we all have the opportunity to think, and by god I'm going to change the world. Even if it's one person at a time. Stop thinking of limitations, think of the endless opportunity. With what you have stated is why you would probably fail at achieving office (no offense to you). You need to be confident, have a humble ground, and fix things through trying. There is always a way to something, it's not always a straight road to it, it takes lots of turns and detours but in the end if you keep at it, you'll reach your destination. Believe in yourself"

damn5ha,FFF_in_WY,Really? My ballot had 5 options. Just because we're too stupid to leave the two party duopoly doesn't mean we don't have the option.
damp06r,ilovesquares,Maybe people would vote third party if the candidates weren't idiots
damqijv,FFF_in_WY,"If alternative parties start pulling 20+% of the vote, the candidates will appear. It's the chicken and the egg - or we can stick with turkeys & vultures. It's up to us to decide when enough is enough."
damrknl,ilovesquares,"Those same candidates could just go through the first two parties no? I'm not saying you're wrong, I just see a lot of reddit circlejerking around look how peachy the world would he if we had 3 parties"
damtkhk,FFF_in_WY,"The electoral process is the problem. Bipartisan consensus is the problem. The power of lobbying money going to the red team and the blue team from the same sources is the problem.It's theoretically possible to reform the Republicrat party from within, but let's look at the practicality of that. Sanders ran as a Democrat for pragmatic reasons. I was at my state caucuses, where the long term legit dems were fighting tooth and nail to keep their delegates going to HRC, because they thought it 'unfair' that a career Independent / Democratic Socialist was trying to steal the nomination of 'their' party. Sanders won the caucuses 56% to 44% in Wyoming. However, once the super delegates got to play they're cards, HRC took 11 of the state's total delegates to his 7. That means she lost the vote by 12% but won the delegate count by 19%. Phrased differently, she enjoyed 31% flip.This is a pretty good analog or microcosm for what it's like trying to reform the legacy parties from within. Three - and preferably more - parties helps give the people an opportunity to address the issues in my first paragraph with a little less interference from entrenched systems.It isn't a magic bullet, and the biggest problem with our republic is much more comprehensive: we're occasionally voters, but we're almost never citizens. We don't advocate on our own behalf. We refuse to make a call or write a letter to express our concerns to our representatives.I sure as fuck don't think alternative parties will fix everything. I just want to give other Americans fewer opportunities to continue to make the worst possible selections."
dan7045,ilovesquares,"These are really good points and I appreciate that you took the time out to educate me, seriously. I don't want to come off as really cynical, but don't you think that lobbyists would be able to buy influence in third parties as well? One thing this election taught me is that things like the Clinton machine are not as powerful as they would have us believe. Everyone everywhere thought she would win. I thought there would be no contest because I actually believed Clinton had enough power to not let herself lose. I was one of those people who complained that it was rigged anyway so why vote. This election renewed my faith in the process. My reason for bringing this up is that a few months ago I would have told you that even if 3 parties were popular, people like Clinton and the DNC would have rigged things against Bernie anyway, regardless of how he ran. I now believe it is actually possible to open up the system, despite it still being way more difficult than many people think. Just voting wont do it. Saying that we're occasionally voters but almost never citizens hit the nail on the head. However I don't think its entirely our fault (not saying that what you think, just mentioning it). Being stuck in this rat race makes it very difficult for the middle class to find time to be politically active"
danox7a,FFF_in_WY,"The intrinsic value of alternative parties in terms of lobbying influence is that those in-roads aren't established - yet. I have no illusions that they wouldn't be built eventually, but the interim time available would provide a party with a relatively clean slate and a real shot at people-first policy advocacy. Plus the people working in a new party have a high probability for being idealistic and more difficult to corrupt. Politicians in the legacy parties are often cynics looking for a pay off or a revolving door.This election merely confirmed my suspicion that Americans are still angry and only marginally rational. When given the choice between Giant Douche and Turd Sandwich by the legacy parties, this still persuaded almost no one to look further down the ballot for more palatable options. The outcomes simply serve to point out the massive disservice done to the country by the kingmakers of the RNC and the DNC. These two candidate were both objectively terrible candidates, and they forced them into the general election anyway.As it stands, the caucus / primary system gives a tiny portion of the country the standing to thrust their will upon the entire electorate. Sure, people could go join up and fight the battle from within, but the given how that went this election season (particularly for progressives that jumped in for Bernie), I doubt we'll see participation in the legacy parties increase. I hope I'm wrong.You're right that the alternative party candidates sucked again this year. What we need is enough popular outcry to pull in a charismatic outsider or two to 3rd parties. People don't want to go do the work themselves yet - Americans spend 4.5 hours a day watching TV. They need a symbol that they can rally behind. That's what Trump is: the awful piece of crap that was still marketed as the best symbol for change this year.On the whole, I'm not really hopeful that national-level politics will change until things get much worse. This year is a prime example. So, you're not the only cynic. But I won't recuse myself from the process, because I am constitutionally incapable. So for now I just try to convince others to be open-minded about the options of the so-called protest vote. Any non-voter that I can introduce to the merits of alternative parties is a win in my thin little book."
danw4jj,LatverianCyrus,"The Bull Moose party pulled some 27% of the votes in 1912, and it sure as hell didn't stick around, or start any third party renaissance.

damsj4g,loozerr,"I mean, with Trump I hope everything gets left up to the states."
dampsnu,,The issue with this is that you can't exactly choose which state you live in after you get cancer if you're poor.
damqhzv,Lord_Kek,How hard is it to get pot these days? It's practically everywhere. And just because it could be legalized at the Federal level doesn't mean it won't still be illegal at the state levsl.
damqxa3,,"> And just because it could be legalized at the Federal level doesn't mean it won't still be illegal at the state levsl.I think that's his point, dude. It shouldn't be illegal, period. It doesn't matter that it's easy to find if finding it might ruin your life because someone else doesn't like it."
damr0ue,Lord_Kek,"Yeah, I think it should be legal too. You're preaching to the choir."
dan2pby,,"Yeah. But your previous comment sort of holds two conflicting views. One, you point out how easy it is to get pot, implying that its legal status doesn't matter in a practical sense.But then Two, your second point goes on to state that it is illegal in certain states, and the way your post is phrased leads me to believe that you think that is just or right.My contention is that that is *not* just or right, regardless of what separate states think.I realize that thinking like this can get dangerous, in relation to states rights and what they can and cannot enforce. But cannabis is one of many things that I believe just should not be punishable under normal circumstances.The Federal government has a duty to uphold our country's Constitution, and any state that persecutes someone for consuming cannabis seems to go against the spirit of the Constitution. I'd have to re-read it for a more stable statement/ affirmation, the gist is there.BRB, re-reading the Constitution."
damt7t7,SpitfireIsDaBestFire,"Legalizing it at the federal level would allow drug testing policies in several industries to loosen, even in states where it is already legal.

He said anything and everything to rile up his base and get more people to support him during the election(hes a bullshit artist), and B.) He changes his mind several times a day about any number of policy choices (hes already backtracking on some of the promises he made during the campaign).As has been said several times already, his actions speak louder than anything that comes out of his mouth. His appointment of Jeff Sessions (a staunch opponent of marijuana legalization)for Attorney General shows that he is on the side of keeping marijuana illegal, since I'm sure Sessions will make this issue a priority given the momentum that has already been gathered for legalization. Actions speak louder than words, ESPECIALLY when it comes to Trump."

So who the fuck knows what he thinks. Half the shit he tweets and says is bullshit and he reverses the next day or says he was being sarcastic. Happy now? Not sure why it's necessary to point out the details about his inability to convey a genuine thought on an issue. It's been evident for the last year."
damzaoq,Lord_Kek,He said they should be punished for receiving an **illegal** abortion if abortion were made **illegal**. It was a gotcha question.
dan01s0,iHasABaseball,"Missed the point. The point is he routinely says one thing, then backs off of it after being advised by people who aren't morons. Just as he gave a stupid answer to that question, then reversed his position a day later. Not going to argue the validity of the question. It's a red herring. Though he certainly got got. So when you quote him saying this or that about marijuana or just about any other issue on the table, it really doesn't mean anything. Tomorrow he'll say the opposite or appoint someone who is diametrically opposed to what he thinks is the better policy. He's a tool. ✌️️"

Nothing quite like having one's orientation, and person preference among consenting adults, turned into pantomime villainy to distract from familial shortcomings.Being openly homophobic was a Conservative Republican trait until Hillary became the champion of Bill's signature of DoMA.

When you say that you approve of something that's currently illegal becoming legal then the assumption is that you want the law changed so you PERSONALLY can benefit from it. Look at how long it was before SSM was something that a LOT of straight people were saying they wanted to see happen. Why? Because the natural assumption is that if you want it to happen it's so YOU can go get married to someone of the same gender. Same thing with pot: if you want it to happen it's so YOU can go get high (which means that you're probably already getting high, which means that we should drug test you a lot more often). See what I mean?"

You think that volunteering for the organization NORML is something that shows up on a lot of applications & resumes then? Or if you were just shooting the shite with a TSA agent while you're in line at the airport? You don't think that they'd pull you to the side?"
damuyjp,,"Yep, bring it on. The majority of places I've worked would either ignore it or not bother enforcing a drug test.Also, it's *super* simple to advocate for something while demonstrating that you don't partake yourself. Basically rephrase the above sentence to match your perspective, there you go.Maybe I'm just fortunate in my work experiences, I do realize that some employers / businesses (especially large corporations) are all no-nonsense. (Which, depending on your perspective, equates to ALL nonsense.)Also, I don't think I would ever shoot the shit with a TSA agent unless they were nice enough to start the conversation. Just cause I'm not that talkative. But if they did, and we suddenly stumbled onto the conversation of weed, yes I would voice my opinion that it should be legalized, and I would have no qualms about doing that. I'd be pissed if they made a show of it, but at the end of the day they would have nothing on me.The fact that you suggested the TSA scenario over any other more plausible scenario sort of baffles me, btw. I think there are better examples that would illustrate your point better. The TSA one is just so ridiculous for it to even happen. Sort of ruins the suspension of disbelief."
dan2lso,MisterRection,"Well I would've said talking to a cop, but honestly standing in line at the airport bored out of your mind seemed more relatable to since there's not as much opportunity for most people to find themselves talking to a cop in an unofficial capacity these days. And yeah, your workplace is apparently WAY more lax about that sort of thing than most. I've had maybe one or two bosses that I could probably even have gotten high WITH, but compared to how many places where I've had arsehole bosses who would rather find piddly shite to get employees fired for in order to make themselves look like they were helping the company instead of actually **working** to improve the business?

[Source, July 2014](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/hillary-clinton-book-tour-108571)* Later in October of 2015, when asked about the stance she gave in the previous bullet point, she said (paraphrase) she would not be changing her position, but would like to add that she does believe marijuana needs to be decriminalized, particularly for non-violent offenders. [Source, October 2015](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/hillary-clinton-book-tour-108571)* Regarding Chelsea Clinton, she did not say people died directly from marijuana use but that they had from interactions between other drugs and marijuana. I'm not going to speak to the veracity of that statement because I'm fact-checking reddit users, not trying to prove a point. [Source](http://www.snopes.com/chelsea-clinton-marijuana/)* Hillary Clinton's donors are public information and yes, she has received funds from medical groups that could possibly benefit from medical marijuana remaining illegal.

[Source](http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/16/politics/hillary-clinton-marijuana/)All that being said, I'm on the internet and I would be remiss if didn't shit my own opinion into the fray here. So from this point on, it's all editorial:Hillary is a professional politician who notoriously plays it safe when it comes to public speaking. She waffles her opinions, just like every other politician, and personally that's not something I like. You can say people's views change over time but there are some things she champions now that she only VERY recently came out in support of, and the timing of that support is sometimes suspect (prime example, gay marriage support).Pot was legal in the US until the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937. The reason it became illegal in the first place is extremely suspect, considering some of the main reasons for its illegalization were its:* ability to cause men of color to become violent and solicit sex from white women* association with Mexican immigrants who were being propagandized at the time as violent and undesirableUp until that point marijuana (more commonly known to the US population during that time as cannabis, and no one was trying very hard to make that association apparent to the layman) was legal and in fact used in many medicines. Because of this, it seems silly to me that there would be such grand discussion about if it's ""dangerous"" to legalize it when it wasn't considered dangerous in the first place until someone had a political axe to grind.On top of all of that, even though the MTA of 1937 was later ruled unconstitutional, marijuana was then immediately lumped into the most restrictive category (or ""Schedule"") of the Controlled Substances Act in the 1970s as a ""placeholder"". Its proper placement was effectively put on hold until then-president Richard Nixon could formally and officially provide a recommendation on its proper placement within the Act.Well, considering Nixon was full-swing on his War on Drugs it would make sense that he would come down harshly on any drug, and it's even less of a stretch to see why he would continue illegalizing a drug that two entire generations of his citizens had grown up only knowing as an illegal substance. He was met with basically no opposition and it kept its place as a Schedule I substance.Long story short, marijuana probably shouldn't have been made illegal in the first place and as such it's silly to have a debate about now making it recreationaly legal. That being said, if it's going to be used in medicine then it absolutely should be tested rigorously just like ever other substance identified as medicine. Currently the political and public opinion of it seems to be switched, however, and medical marijuana is seen as a gateway to recreational marijuana, when in actuality it should be the exact opposite.Thanks for reading!"

People wanted to know she wasn't just doing a song and dance for the plebs and putting the real work in for her donors and wealthy constituents.Now, I'm not saying that's who Clinton might in her heart of hearts be, but that was a big part of her image problem.

Sessions is extremely likely to do just that.So yeah, Hillary's position was pretty dim. But let's not pretend like there's some parallel to be drawn here because there's just not."

When the media was talking about how Jeff Sessions is a bad choice because he is racist/white nationalist I could not believe they were dumb enough to say things like that. They're not used to the fact that people can go online and figure things out for themselves. He hunted down the KKK in Georgia and prosecuted them more than any other official I know of. He sought the death penalty for KKK members. He integrated the Georgia school systems. He marched in Selma with John fucking Lewis. HE FOUGHT SEGREGATION. The fact that so many people believe that he is now a racist/white nationalist is incredibly scary. CNN is just like Pravda. The fact that people pretend to take jokes literally so they can pretend to be offended is sad too.

He decides ""in the moment"". Take ""arresting Hillary"" as an example. He said it during the debates because he was irritated with her but after he wins he's not interested in following up. So what happens when some member of Congress gets under his skin _while he is President?_ Will he just say shit or, now that he has the power to act, will he send marines to arrest the traitor? Nobody knows. I mean he's obviously not actually worried about people who leak secrets because he's considering David Patreaus as a SecState candidate. It just depends on how he's _feeling_ at that moment.We'll just have to wait and see."

damoxyt,neverquit1979,"it would seem that way yes... but I don't for one second believe his is the type of person to just let those people do what they want. TBH before he ran for president he was a pretty mainstream person, not homophobe racists, hes pretty well rounded and probably has real connections to those communities and will not allow any type of discrimination that is being spread. it would appear that everyone who vote for Hillary thinks the US is about to go back to the 1950s, which is simply foolish, Roe V wade wont be over turned, none of those scare tactics will happen.. I genuinely don't think any of that stuff has a chance, and its extremely offsetting that folks who constantly attack trump voters think that the voters themselves want that, or would stand by if it started to happen. I would wager a small amount of both sides harbor those feelings and views, the rest of us just want a fair shot at making a good life for ourselves, our family and neighbors."
dankxmi,ThePnusMytier,"Honestly, though I disagree with his methods and what he ran for I couldn't blame the people that voted for Trump, and now hate the fact that people on my side of the fence always jump to calling his supporters racists misogynist pigs... he is the only one who spoke out to working class white America, and people put the priority of fighting clear corruption on the democratic side as the most important issue. I get that and respect those stances.But he ran on promises that worried a lot of us. Despite his mainstream past and legitimate connections, he still pushed some policies that seemed concerning... but maybe not completely sincere. You say he wouldn't let them do what they want, but he's becoming surrounded by them... they will be able to overpower him, and he doesn't have the political experience to just shut down everything they do. His list of potential appointments to the Supreme Court has many people that have shown support for overturning Roe v Wade. I'm not jumping to saying it'll all happen. But on your end, please don't just tell us it's nothing to worry about and maintain full confidence that these people he's surrounding himself with won't be able to continue on the path that their entire political history has followed."

damnq8s,100percentpureOJ,Yes I know that but police don't enforce those laws in states where marijuana is legal. Police unions are separated by state and enforce state law. Federal law enforcement agencies will make arrests but that is also unlikely. You don't really know what you are talking about huh?
damo2cm,PinkysAvenger,"Its entirely the call of the president, and the president-elect announced that he's appointing a seriously anti-marijuanna AG.

Even if Trump meant what he says, on some of these issues he'd have to fight against the entire rest of the government and his own cabinet to do it.Yea you can win that fight once or twice but you're not going to win it most of the time. Congress can and will screw him over if there isn't some tit for tat. They have that power and a number of them have motive to do it."

damnhcj,saltyladytron,"> his choices for his cabinet I seriously wonder how much of his choices are limited to people willing to work with/for him. Part of me blames partisan politics - the incredibly divisive culture perpetuated by *both* parties.

damwzr5,McGuineaRI,"People privy to the selection process have said that Tulsi Gabbard is at the very top of a very short list with others on the list being there out of courtesy or to make a case for themselves that might persuade him otherwise. Trump likes her because her ideas about stopping unnecessary foreign intervention line up with his own. He also has a wider strategy of pulling out of the middle east economically (via energy policy) as well as militarily so he'll need her expertise on the region. It's an interesting process because we haven't seen a president in a while who *really* picks his own cabinet.Get ready for the day after her selection though when she gets her ""white nationalist"" card from the press."

Plenty ran, even a couple Republicans were learned and accomplished statesmen--and decent human beings to boot.But Trump wasn't one of them. He won by shear force of personality. He's very charismatic, especially if you're predisposed to liking his ideas. Unfortunately that predisposition stems from some of the worst human instincts, and the least admirable attributes of the American electorate.He's also a shameless panderer, although I can almost give him a pass on that. Every politician makes promises that they can't keep. But Trump takes it to another level. He promises things that aren't just politically impractical (if not outright impossible) but that wouldn't even be effective if achieved.He's a salesman. Not even a particularly good one. He couldn't convince a majority or even a plurality of Americans to buy what he's selling. But our quirky electoral system, the product of historical accidents, means we're stuck with him now for four years. We're all going to be worse off, especially his supporters. And that's a shame. They need help, and they won't get it."

He has done a out no actual philanthropy and has in fact frequently backed out of charitable donations he has promised and his charity has near to had its charity certificates revoked. The thing you may not get is that for Trump there is no such thing as ""enough money"". You probably have an amount of money where for you, you'd be good. Comfortable, happy, able to devote your life to the pursuit of happiness and anything above that you'd find things to do with. Charity maybe, additional luxury maybe, but regardless, you have an amount or the idea of an amount that's ""enough"". He doesn't.Further, we aren't even sure he has any significant amount of money given that his tax information STILL hasn't been released.Maybe. MAYBE. Trump isn't hiding something.

damv06z,100percentpureOJ,"Companies profit when the populations suffers. So when the population is doing well companies must have lower profits.

They don't like the idea that people in a city far away can make a determination that greatly effects the lives of people depending on where they live because the 50 states/1 solution model of the federal government has that kind of flaw. They think that wherever possible, issues should be left for states to decide for themselves. Each state has its own people, culture, and economy.

State's Rights were for: 1) Slavery -- took away minority rights (and made them not even people) 2) Segregation -- took away minority rights3) Anti-choice issues -- try to take away women's rights routinely and on the regular by chipping away at Roe v.

damsyh5,100percentpureOJ,Wishing the confedrates won the civil war does not mean they support slavery anyway. There is no politician in their right mind who would openly advocate for segregation or bringing back slavery. If you actually think that then there is no point in continuing this conversation.
damtdxi,Antivote,[ Nearly 20 percent of Donald Trump's voters disagreed with the freeing of slaves in Southern states after the Civil War.](http://www.snopes.com/trump-supporters-pro-slavery/)
damtp4r,100percentpureOJ,">Although 20 percent of likely Trump voters indicated they disapproved of the executive order that freed slaves, 71 percent of white respondents in total said they approved of it (leaving 29 percent presumably in the ""disapproval"" category). Bizarrely, that number was static for black voters of all parties, and reached only 60 percent for Hispanic voters. Put another way, **a different approach to these numbers would suggest more black voters than Trump supporters disapproved of the Emancipation Proclamation** (somehow, that didn't make it into the news cycle).I'm guessing you didn't actually read the article before you posted it but that's ok, Snopes is shit anyway."
damnol5,berrieh,">Well that's not very fair. Do you really think Republicans currently are for slavery and segregation? I know that the parties have switched places several times so if we are going based off of current party platforms you can't really include those things.No, but that poster was speaking to what has been done in the name of States' rights and what hasn't. I would not say Republicans are pro-slavery and I do not think they want de juro segregation (many GOP seem to want to amplify de facto segregation, but that existed all over the US and was not a States' Rights issue). >True, but it was Republican appointed justices that voted for abortion rights in Roe v. Wade in the first place.Sure, some were, but not because the GOP supported it or anything. Because the Justices found it legitimately Constitutional. The two dissenters were of different parties (Renquist appointed by Nixon; White by Kennedy). That doesn't change that the States' rights people use it as fodder and want the states to have the right to restrict the rights of individual women... The GOP routinely passes laws that erode women's rights, like the recent one in TX to charge mothers to cremate the remains of aborted fetuses. >I will give you those, but as I said before Trump advocates for state rights on those issues. He has said that gay marriage has already been decided, although he disagrees he won't change it, and thinks states should decide marijuana legalization for themselves.The people he's appointed to oversee these things don't seem to agree with him though.

damlfm9,uwhuskytskeet,Republican and Democrat platforms essentially traded sides in the 20th century.
damllo5,100percentpureOJ,So bringing up desegregation and slavery as issues Republicans fought against may have been a bad idea.

dammbwk,100percentpureOJ,Why wouldn't he just say what he means. And it's not like the parties just decided to switch policies. They changed sides on a number of issues but also kept the same view on others. They didn't just change names and call it a day.
dammj73,DoogieHueserMD,"Because in modern day American the two are used interchangeably and they essentially did switch sides on a lot of issues. It was a slow and gradual process that took multiple elections worth of platforms, but it did change."

dammnd9,berrieh,"It actually isn't. The parties have switched several times. I'd gladly be a Republican in the era where they were the Democrats of their day; I don't give a shit about the name of the party. What's important is their platform. It's not like picking a sport team. A summary of their switches: >Northern (and later coastal) “City” Interests: Federalists, Whigs, Third Party Republicans, Fourth Party Progressive era Republicans (like Teddy), Fifth Party Democrats (starting in the 1930's under FDR, then culminating with LBJ and then Clinton), Modern Democrats.>Southern (and later middle) “Rural” Interests: Anti-Federalists, Democratic-Republicans, Third Party Democrats, Fourth Party Progressive Era Democrats (Like Wilson), Fifth Party Republicans (starting in the 1920's under Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, then culminating with Nixon and then Bush), Modern Republicans.>The south is still the south, the north is still the north, a city is still is a city, and rural voters are still rural. That isn't what changed. In any era, geopolitical voters still have their unique vices, like those evidenced by shameful Jim Crow Southern politics or the under-represented Southern Black Belt, or those evidenced by Northern Ghettos filled with refugees from the great migration and working class immigrants. They also have their unique virtues, be they fighting for individual rights, fairness for the farmer, and protecting jobs at home, or for fighting for collective social justice, workers rights, minority rights, and the global trade and central banking that ensures America's status as a Hegemonic superpower. Sure, at times the divide in America is a single voter issue or economic class struggle, but the basic city/north vs. rural/south split is nearly constant. Thus, it is a good metric for tracing a line through 240 years of factions.http://factmyth.com/factoids/democrats-and-republicans-switched-platforms/"
dammuek,uwhuskytskeet,How can this even be argued? Republicans today would have been democrats in 1860 and vice versa.
dammxcl,Syn7axError,"It's worth looking at [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_election_results_by_state). The party platforms actually swap pretty often, with many people seeing 1992 as the last big one. It's a very fundamental part of understanding the parties."
dammxoj,Tuft64,"Except that doesn't matter if the party doesn't even resemble what it once was.If the Republican party 100 years from now started to advocate the means of production being expropriated from the capitalist class, it wouldn't be fair to say ""WELL LOOK AT 100 YEARS AGO, DEFINITIVE PROOF THAT REPUBLICANS ARE BIG BUSINESS CORPORATE SHILLS"".As far as specifics go, the republicans were a new party in Lincoln's day. They were a conglomeration of various northern former Whig constituencies and people that wanted to develop the west that coalesced due to issues surrounding slavery. Generally speaking, they retained a lot of the older Whig economic views that the government should be involved in the economy. It should promote policies that promote growth, they thought. That meant financing infrastructure, education, protecting native industries, policies that promoted commerce and rapid job growth. They did believe in more federal involvement in all these things, and it cost money. They were the forward looking, innovative party, and also vaguely speaking they were the ""big government"" party and had policies that promoted big banks, big industry, big business.The democrats were the more tradition-minded party. They were also the party focused on keeping taxes low and when it came to promoting commerce, etc... wanted to leave it to the states. Generally speaking, they were the ""states' rights"" party.The shift started after the Civil War and continued for over 135 years. After the civil war, the republicans started to split into factions generally divided between how deep ""in bed"" you got with big business, so they developed a conservative business wing often at odds with with the more progressive wing. The democrats pretty much stayed the states rights party and were marginalized at the national level for several decades.Key points in the shift to the structure we know today:1896: William Jennings Bryan incorporates the Populist Party vote, giving the democrats a sizable left wing on economics that it didn't have before. 1912: Theodore Roosevelt breaks from the republicans and runs as the candidate of the Progressive Party - this makes the republican progressive wing - once a third to a half of the republican coalition, much less committed to the party going forward and they never really reconcile. Republican leadership comes more and more from its conservative wing after that.1932-45: Franklin Roosevelt essentially adopts most of the old Progressive platform and pretty much incorporates that whole vote into his Democratic coalition. This puts the party on a collision course when it comes to social policy. 1964: Lyndon Johnson essentially divorces the longest marriage the democratic party had: the one with southern whites. By making Civil Rights part of the Democratic platform, the republicans lose basically all of what's left of their black constituencies - which had been a significant part of their remaining progressive vote in northern urban areas. The democrats start to hemorrhage southern whites rapidly - you see George Wallace run for president in 1968.2000: The process is 98% complete. By this time liberals are in the democrats and conservatives in the republicans for the most part.There are more complexities within and after that but those are the major turning points. The current situation we have was solidified during the Lewinsky scandal of 1998 and the ensuing 2000 election. So you can see this was a very, very long process. Circa the late 1990s you saw the last generation that had republican liberals and democratic conservatives."
damn8vo,,"Yes, that's why democrats are the ones holding up confederate flags and the majority live in the south still, OH WAIT."
damo68k,Bejeweled_Bird,"Yeah kinda sucks how democrats created that group of people for political gain, the US probably would be in a lot better shape if the dems wouldn't do anything for power."
damolnk,,"Yes, the democrats make them pick up the confederate flag. ""Liberals made me do it!!"""
damqo4d,Bejeweled_Bird,Well they fostered a several generations of hate for votes and still are fostering hate for votes - calling the right Nazis ring a bell?

They fought hard to try to force Northern states to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act, and wanted a constitutional amendment declaring that all newly-formed states would be slave states.Desegregation was a bipartisan issue. Right at the cusp of the [Southern Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy), when the Solid South was solidly Democratic. Before the Republicans deliberately took the title ""The Party of Racism"".The other three are entirely correct."
damm89q,Connor121314,Democrats were pro-slavery.
dammxf5,tacknosaddle,That's a lovely talking point but it means nothing regarding today's parties when you consider that after the civil rights act the majority of Dixie Democrats who were the slavery supporters became Republicans. Should today's Democratic party claim St. Ronnie Reagan as a Democratic president because prior to switching his party affiliation in 1962 he had been a lifelong Democrat. Trying to tarnish today's Democratic party with slavery makes the same amount of sense.
damo5rl,Connor121314,"I understand that. But they were saying that the Republican Party supported slavery, which isn't true. I get that the ideologies flipped. I'm not a Republican supporter. I was just correcting the guy who said that Republicans were pro-slavery."

Or are the tables of ""Muh minority is deciding what we do!!!!!"" turning now? If only 30% of people in X state want gay marriage, would that be allowed in terms of minority ruling the majority or are we going to be consistent that majority is in the right?Universal healthcare's kind of an iffy. Obamacare is a huge problem and has put a giant burden on a lot of people. It's a shit system, I don't know how a lot of people don't realize that. I don't know what Trump wants but I think his ultimate goal is to go back to private - which worked better, had lower premiums, etc than the system now.Don't know what his stance on drug abuse is, though, just pot. Didn't really see too many people saying ""Yeah! Decriminalize heroine! Wooo!!"" so I'm not really sure if we're really heading that way just yet, and if we are, it's extremely far off.Colleges should be a state issue. Colleges in-state are already really, really damn cheap, though and they give out financial aid like it's candy."

damrk66,jcrdy,i think that there is a key issue with the statement before trump. the ideals and momentum behind trump grew in time but the actual election of trump and the support for what he has said has always been there. maybe it wasn't the loudest message of where we were heading as a nation until he started rearing his head but it isn't like the trump vote happens and the next day we did a 180 degree turn.

dan1d9t,ashesashesdustdust,"Look at the appointment of jeff sessions and his characterizations of marijuana as evil. Look at Pence's obsession with gays, insistence that it's a choice, and support of conversion therapy. Trump said whatever he thought people wanted to hear, but based on the appointments he's made so far, and meetings and calls involving Ivanka, his main focus is his own interests and he's surround himself with terrible politicians. We know he wants his VP to do all the work because he previously asked Kasich to be his VP and take care of domestic policy. When Kasich asked what Trump would be busy doing, he said, ""I'll be making America great again."" So far it looks like that's focusing on his own deals (scottish wind farms blocking his views? argentinian business project moving too slow? fixed!) so we can assume the people he appoints will be able to do their jobs without him interfering.

Where the Fed gets 5-10% to handle those tasks, and the states decide their tax rate and handle education, infastructure, healthcare, welfare. Social security should be an independent national fund that employers and optionally the employees pay into.Just my thoughts, would love to hear some discussion. I think about this a lot lol."

We have given too much power to the central government, and it shouldn't be the largest influence on our day to day lives. Instead your local and state government should be the most influential election on your life. You want to live in a liberal state that has a high minimum wage, free health care, and free college, and can finance this through state taxes, and not national ones? Awesome! I may choose to move out of that state, but who cares? You live in the state that represents you the most. The farther your government moves away from you, the less it represents you.

The idea that the Dems forced this is false."
damuwz7,thumbgreen,"I think OP's point still stands, they just used the wrong example. The point being that Dems favor federal rights over state rights at least when it comes to social issues. It wasn't uncommon to hear that things like gay rights and drug reform shouldn't be left up to the states because some wouldn't come around. Then also hearing how state rights could be a double edged sword with states enforcing even more draconian laws. As a nonpartisan it certainly seems that Dems favor federal government. Which explains why they focus more on presidential elections than they do state and local elections (I'd like to point out that for this election cycle they funneled funds away from local elections into the Hillary Victory Fund).It's anecdotal, I know but it's what I've seen and all I can comment on."

Then one spouse couldn't visit the other in the hospital.Or with marijuana. It's on a federal schedule. If the next pres decided to enforce the federal regulation then this whole thing is over. As is marijuana companies cannot use banking systems and that's a big issue.I agree with the sentiment, but there's a whole lot of changes that would need to happen at the federal level in order for this to work.

The end result is university still cost more for CA residents now than it did even two years ago, which was more than it cost two years before that. Oh and he also pushed to raise sales taxes, including on textbooks.The last time legalization came up Jerry Brown, Dianne Feinstein, Barbara Boxer, and a litany of other California Democrats actively campaigned, and funded the campaign against it.Then there was the whole deafening silence on Prop. 8 as well.

(Also college kids and they're typically aren't financially viable) My point with this is that there's no money in your idea to actually support the things you want because a lot of these people aren't contributing. Because there's not enough jobs or because they're used to a hand out system. (Not being mean but generational welfare and living on hand outs is a very real thing.) So if each state tried to live independently, where's the money coming from? Most of these states, for some of the reasons I mentioned, are currently running at a deficit. Now you want to add free healthcare, college and whatever else. Who is paying for that? And if they want to see a Dr or go to a college in a red state? Listen, the dems need to change their views to win. We need financial conservatism and social liberalism. I see no one with that platform. Dems are too liberal financially but at the same time as shady as republicans. They try to sell people on ideals, which is nice, but gay marriage and abortions ain't paying for free health care. And republicans, well their best guy was Don J Trump sooooo...."
dampf35,,>you're forgetting the amount of people in blue states that don't work.No I'm not. It's just not statistically significant to the argument. [Here's](http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm) the unemployment rate state by state. There's no significant outliers of unemployed populations to think that they couldn't supported by the other 93-97% of the population. Your argument isn't based correctly.
damn2f8,donny420,"Why bother continuing to have a divided nation? Last I heard your country was called the ""United States of America,"" not the Divided states of America."
damn7m6,faketwelve,"This is the argument libertarians have been making in regard to states rights for a couple decades now. Everyone jumps down libertarian's throats because they say they don't think an issue is best addressed by the federal government, but that doesn't mean they don't want that issue dealt with at all. Like Gary Johnson said this election, we've got 50 labortories where we can try new ideas and then hopefully adopt the best.Take same sex marriage. It was totally a domino effect once a few states had the courage to legalize it. 38 states legalized it before it was deemed legal nation wide, and even then I believe it was the supreme court, not congress or the president who made the ruling.Washington and Colorado are showing everyone how legalized pot will not usher in the apocalypse as so many prohibitionist claimed. Its honestly a shame that the Colorado universal healthcare didn't pass, because that could have been another step in the right direction.I'm not an ideologue when it comes to libertarianism (e.g. not opposed to universal healthcare that works, etc), but I do think they have the right idea in terms of states rights. People always argue about the negative aspects of states rights, like states who defund planned parent hood, or fears of descrimination, but as same sex marriage has shown us, when something works the majority will adopt it, and drag those other states along. I'd rather live in a country where the majority are moving in the right direction, with a few pockets of resistance, than a nation that relies on our dysfunctional congress to get things done. I think on the whole, handling more issues at the state level is our best vehicle for progress. It'd be nice if progressives and libertarians could get past their differences and work together on issues like this."
damn8zw,Johngjacobs,"Moving and setting up in a new state requires money. Everything you said is great but in that plan poor people and minorities are still screwed. If everyone that could move could then that would be fine but basically the people that could/would move would be people who can probably already afford healthcare and college. As those who can afford it leave and move to blue states what ends up happening is that this creates an economic/brain drain that lowers tax revenues in red states. Then when the red states want to ""upgrade"" they can't afford to, so nothing changes. So the poor get poorer and the rich get free education and cheaper healthcare. Like I said it's a great idea but eventually the federal government would have to step in to help poorer states. And maybe that's the way it has to be done, drag the red states so deep into poverty that they don't have a choice but to ask for help and then all those laws/programs can be switched over to the federal level."
damn93g,timbe3,"In general I agree with this 100%. However, my concern is that it allows for the exact opposite as well..e.g. being gay is a crime, only creationism is taught, you only get medical coverage if you can afford it, no minimum wage. etc...That could have a tremendous impact on several generations, not to mention the impact on our overall economic position."

A deal so enticing that people will move out of their red states to them.The thing is that a ton of people DON'T find those things enticing. Including many people in the blue states you would want to do this to.So what would actually happen is that red and blue states would chase out anyone who doesn't agree with them and the country would become even MORE divided. In fact, we wouldn't be one country any more. We'd be two countries with some really fucked up borders.This assumes people would be willing to relocate based on how much they were for/against these issues. I'm really dubious of this as a concept, but it's the basis of your argument.Personally, I think what we really need to do is find ways to become more centrist as a country and stop letting the nuts on the far left and far right dictate where we go.I think one of the best things we could do is to get rid of the electoral college and make voting mandatory. That way you can get a clear view of what the majority of the country wants instead of who is shouting loudest from the far reaches of either side. I think this would provide wins for both sides. Many social issues would be won by the left (most people don't give two shits about who marries who) and a lot of fiscal issues would go right (most people think the government spends too much).I think we should be looking for ways to become more *united* as a county instead of more *divided*."
damq6hj,,">A ton of people don't find those things enticingWhat's not enticing about free education?

This would be something gradual overtime, as blue states progressed.The goal isn't to get people to move out of red states. It's to make red states seem less enticing, and therefore force them to compete with blue states and change their ideology. It's just competition."
damtms8,AshFirecrest,"Free education was not the only thing you listed. You're trying to say that if a bunch of blue states made pot legal, instituted universal healthcare and legalized gay marriage that deeply red states would be like, ""Man, look at that utopia. Let's do that because free education! Nevermind that the social issues they've embraced are things we've vehemently opposed for decades/centuries. Our minds are totally changed because free education.""I don't know why I have to say this, but not everyone has the same ideals that you do and many many people would look at that ""utopia"" with abhorrence and disgust - regardless of the free education you've tacked on to the end. I see absolutely no result where your idea draws people together and a far greater likelihood that it does nothing more than drive the ideologies further apart.And you assume everyone would look at free education as a good thing in the first place. You asked ""What's not enticing about free education?"" How about the fact that nothing is free? Any state that enacted ""free"" education would have to raise the money (see: taxes) to pay for it. Teachers still need to be paid, campuses still need to be maintained, research still needs to be funded. Free education is a misnomer embraced by people who get too caught up in what it would mean for them individually and fail to think just one step forward. That education you got for ""free"" when you were young would be something you'd be paying for with increased taxes for the rest of your life.I've seen enough of this argument to know that right now, you're already hovering over the reply button and thinking about how to phrase something along the lines of ""Well, I'm already basically already going to be paying off my student loans for the rest of my life"". Which is why you should be advocating education *reform*. Instead of making the rest of us pay for the college tuition of every graduate, we should be holding schools accountable for the exorbitant amounts they're charging in the first place."

That's not because running facilities or paying teachers has become 10x more expensive. It's because they can charge that if they want to.

Addicted at 18, methadone clinic for 9 years, and still struggle. I just turned 30. I wasn't told anything about how addictive they are, or the signs/how you get addicted. But rest assured, I was inundated with PSAs from ""Drug-Free America"" about the ""deadly risks"" of pot. Do you know how many people I've known who have died from pot? Zero. How many who've died from opiates? Six, in the past two years alone."

When it was founded, not all people were allowed to vote so they had to give states ""points"" based on all those people the south kept buying who they wouldn't allow to actually vote. Now that everyone can vote, we should just let all votes be equal. When we designed this country, there was not any real democratic government on earth to model ourselves after. A self-governing republic was hypothetical, so we did the best we could.But just like any v1.0, we now see all the problems we made. That maybe the 1.6 million in two dakotas shouldn't be able to team up and overrule the 39 million in California. Or that you can theoretically win a two way race for president with 28% of the vote if it's in the right states. Or maybe we should take the advice we gave the world when they asked for advice on writing *their* constitutions: Don't do a president, it's much more likely to lead to dictatorships than parliaments. Divided government doesn't prevent tyrants it creates them. Tyrants need a broken system to rail against, and they need to not have any institutional way to be removed from power the way a prime minister can be dethroned in a vote of no confidence. We should also look at other types of balloting such as instant runoff or (my personal preference) nonpartisan blanket primaries, so that third parties actually have a chance of winning things without splitting the vote to allow a plurality to rule.American institutions need help, but abandoning democracy or suggesting a dissolution of the union is not help."

The flyover states deserve to have a voice, as they generally have and represent a dying culture, and ignoring the dwindling voices half the country disagrees with (and ignoring always happens when they don't have some power and influence) has not, historically, ended well. The house is where population is represented, the senate is where states are represented. I think the house ought to be a bit more powerful than the senate, as it's generally not, but I'm glad there's representation of those small voices I disagree with."

Half the country [live in these few dozen counties](http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/these-counties.png). Right now you can get a majority in the Senate with only 21% of the population which can overrule the other 79% of the country. And with demographic trends that's only going to get worse. All voters should have equal representation. A vote in San Fransisco should not be worth more or less than a vote in Fargo. That doesn't mean we ignore Fargo, we just don't give their vote more power than anyone else's."
dao77an,GTS250,"The senate is by state, the house is by population. That's how it goes. San Fran voters get their say in the House. A few dozen places called Greenville get to speak in the Senate.I live in one of those counties, and I see the point you're making. I just can't agree with it. The san fran voter has very different interests than the out in the sticks voter, and the more populous the cities get the easier it is to drown out the sticks. That's a terrible, terrible fuckin' idea. A system that alienates any significant portion of the country is a bad thing, no matter what portion that is. Population trends and the switch to the service sector for most American lower middle class work ensure that those sticks voters are just going to get more discontent, and having one half of the people who make their laws theoretically represent them more than the other half of the country is a wonderful fig branch. When people feel their interests aren't represented in government, and that the government is unduly punishing them without their say, you get civil unrest. Every time. See: Civil Disobedience and Civil Rights, US Civil War, most mass protests of government action. Half the congress represents the small states, theoretically, and the other half represents every voter equally, theoretically. This keeps the peace, or at least it was intended to."

The two parties are not the same, and if you think that you simply are not paying attention in an effort to feel superior to both in a misguided act of self-promotion and defiance.Change happens, you just have to expand your time horizon. There have been several major restructurings of the US government, but they took time. Do you think change comes easily? Have you never read about the history of the labor movement? Or the suffragettes? Or the Anti-Saloon League? I would also caution about how you talk about the US. It's going through a tumultuous period, but so has every major democracy on earth. And while the next few years are going to suck hard, we are very very far from a failed state.The larger problem to me is not even the senate's imbalance of power, or the electoral college giving the election to the person with the less votes, it's the fact that 60+ million Americans looked at Trump and found him acceptable. That's not a government problem, that's a people problem. There exist no set of real facts which could logically justify this unless you are an open white supremacist. We may have more racists than we like to admit, but white racists alone can't win an election. In the past when a party picked someone ""outside the norm"" like Goldwater or McGovern you saw 45+ state landslides against him. And compared to Trump, those two are not unreasonable at all.Until we figure out how that happened, there's not much we can do. Give us a perfectly designed government but it still won't ""function"" when vote and think as detached from reality as we did this election."
dan8veb,Johnny_Deppthcharge,Rural vs urban is an interesting way to look at it. I'd recommend David Wong's Cracked article about it if you want to know more.
dan2r1w,Teeklin,"We don't need to figure out why that happened, we know exactly why that happened. What we need to do is figure out how to move forward and deal with the challenges of the future when the people in power in every branch of government are all actively working to keep us headed down the path to self destruction.The damage that Trump can do before even the midterms with the kind of clout the GOP has behind him is staggering."
dan7l23,auandi,What bigger challenge could there possibly be than the fact that an increasingly large portion of the American public are unaffected by reality?How can we meet a single challenge if we can't even agree that a challenge exists?You want different leaders? We need different voters not just a different system.
dan8a03,Speen_know,"Please read ""The Genius of America"" by Eric Lane and Michael Oreskes. It seems you have a good grasp on things so please humor me at least. It definitely gave me perspective. Our founding fathers spent their lives researching, discussing, and devising the documents that created this democracy, and personally I think they did a bang up job. I definitely see where you are coming from though, at times the executive branch and legislative branch seem to be too close to each other to create a real check and balance system, or one takes over the other to create a breach of power."
dan9fkb,auandi,"They did an amazing job...... for their time.Their instincts were good, some of their assumptions were off. They simply had no data of real life experiences to draw from without the *very* brief and not very democratic English Commonwealth or the ancient and failed democracies of the classical age.Good science requires that we adapt to the results and data we get. The founders were huge and unwavering believers in the scientific method and the enlightenment. They believed that observation of data would lead to truth and rightness. And after several centuries of political history, countless revolutions, and the failure and rebuilding of almost every other government on earth, we have new information today that they did not have back then.The reason they chose not to have a parliament is they feared what a prime minister could do. They feared that if the executive and legislative branches commingled, than a particularly charismatic leader could rise up and get his loyalists to amass power, shutting down democratic opposition.That is a rightful fear.But evidence shows this is less likely to happen for one key reason they did not think of. When a leader tries to amass power in a parliament, he can only do so with the help of the rest of his party. And dictators don't like to share power with anyone. So would be dictators have a challenge, they must convince the majority of their party to accept less power so he can have more. Members of parliament don't like to give up what power they have, so they usually don't allow that to happen. They serve as a natural check because it is in their self interest that the Prime Minister not amass too much power because power in government is a zero sum game.If a president wants to gain more power he can. Congress can refuse to pass laws the President wants, but the President is in charge of the military, in charge of law enforcement, in charge of executing every law and every agency as they see fit. They are the singular head of government. If the President simply starts directing the agencies he unilaterally runs to act as if a law was passed, there's not much Congress can do short of impeachment (and they have no mechanism to enforce that). The founders were concerned that the ones writing the laws and the ones executing the laws should not be in the same body, but by placing them in different bodies they actually ended up making it *harder* for congress to do anything to stop a dictator president.That's why in 1918 when there were dozens of new democracies flourishing across Europe, we suggested that every single one of them adopt a parliament. We also recommended proportional representation, but that turned out to have it's own dysfunctional problems. So in 1945 and beyond, any time a nation approaches the US to help them write a constitution we still recommend a parliament. I'm under no illusion that the US will change to that system, a president is simply too ingrained in us as a culture. But Prime Ministers must face off directly against other powerful members of parliament to have any power himself. Presidents are given power regardless of their relationship with Congress, meaning there is nothing to stop a dictator president."
danh9zf,patchgrabber,"Jefferson advocated for redoing the Constitution every generation:>“I am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and Constitutions. But laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.”"

dan2mlu,TravvyJ,"A really interesting experiment would be to have the country operate in a 2-in-1 Pert Plus style system. You would essentially have 3 federal-level governments. The key here is that you have one overarching federal government where people still vote on the Commander in Chief every 4 years. Then there are 2 other sub-countires consisting of either the red or blue states from that executive election. Red states form one sub-federal government, and the blue states form another. These red and blue sub-countries get to operate their own legislature and make their own federal laws that have no bearing on the other. This would really allow us to see which policies end up working better. Every 4 years the people of a given state have the opportunity to not only elect a new executive, but also vote to switch legislatures and federal laws if they would rather have what the other side is offering."
dana5v0,urbanastronaut,"This is an interesting concept, but I think switching the legislatures and federal law every 4 years would be a nightmare. Imagine a swing state that would have to re-haul it's government every 4 years. Not to mention the economic cost of changing out official headings on fixtures and documents every 4 years that must have a ""Sub-Country"" heading. (Ex. Changing the signs every 4 years from ""United States Republic Postal Service"" to ""United States Democracy Postal Service."" And that's just a small problem in that sort of society. Imagine the split it would cause citizens in certain states. Right now, Americans are pretty split over our Presidential election. Imagine the anger it sparks during that period of time, and then also add the worry that your state's sub-countryhood might completely change the dynamic of your state. The elections suck, but I'm happy I don't have to suddenly worry about gobbled into whichever state the mid-West would become. On top of that, this would also need to be a super majority vote of at least a 2/3rd's. That might lessen the amount of time a state swings back and forth, but not make it impossible to switch. Your concept is definitely interesting. It'd be really interesting to see how that dynamic would best play out."
danaser,TravvyJ,"Yeah. This was just a loose outline of an idea off the top of my head. I just like the concept. Both sides being able to enact whatever legislation they wanted without the other side interfering. See which ideology rises to the top. Of course, both sides are basically corporate owned at this point, so there might not actually be that much difference.Perhaps the most interesting thing to see to me would be what the Dems did without being able to blame Republicans, and without being able to rely on the 'lesser of two evils' card. Would their base finally be able to see them for who they really are? Would they actually have to start enacting progressive legislation?"

On the other hand it would suck to have a state say, ""nope, can't stop your residency to this state without the proper paperwork and id."" then make it incredibly hard to attain those documents essentially locking in their citizens without reprisal."
damuy59,Touchedmokey,"I'm thinking you're taking this too far. The states would still be united, the federal government would still have a fair amount of power and most issues are tackled at the lowest level of government required to effectively implement a policyYour latter issue sounds like something that would clearly be handled by the federal government"
damvjvl,,"Yeah, I did exaggerate a little, but I think the point remains the same. I definitely think the federal government should only uphold blanket laws, nothing really specific but a general guideline for the way America should work. The states should be left to make inferences on what those laws mean and enforce their version of it so long as it doesn't go against what the federal government says. I'm talking real general laws, like no murdering people or anti theft laws, simple stuff. I just think that if we allow states to polarize themselves too much it would lead to an imbalance, similar to what we are setting in this election. The states should generally run the same, as a country, with small idiosyncrasies in the way they work so we can even out some of this red and blue into a solid purple. For example, if the federal government says alcohol is legal, Utah can't deny anyone the right to sell it anywhere. Unfortunately this means that weed being illegal makes Colorado and California's laws void."

damv0c2,willyslittlewonka,"I don't think us Californians would be better off as a separate country but I think that having a bit more autonomy, as Scotland does with the UK, would be more beneficial for us.

damvn5y,thetrapiche,"We absolutely would be better off. If we were our own country, we'd have the 6th largest economy in the world. We would be the most innovative country in the world (Silicon Valley/San Francisco/World class research universities like Stanford, University of California system). We'd be a major center of finance (San Francisco/Los Angeles). We'd be the entertainment industry capital of the world. We'd still have all our world renown state and national parks, world famous cities, etc. so our tourism dollars wouldn't go down. We would be more than self-sufficient when it comes to agriculture (we're already the number one producing agriculture state in the entire country). And on top of that, we already contribute almost 300 billion dollars to the federal government in tax dollars that we get a smaller proportion of than these assholes in the midwest and the south get. That's money we could spend on free universities, universal health care, etc."
damw0tu,willyslittlewonka,"Still, I'm of the belief we are stronger as 50 states than as just 1. The benefits of having autonomy while still being in the union is that we can keep the $300 billion for ourselves and take part in the working of this country.

Why did it take so long for marijuana to be legalized in California? even though they have been ran by ""progressive"" democrats the past 50 years? It's because money was filling California democrats' pockets to *keep it* illegal. Stop trying to further the divide between us.

Next to no on knows our Vice President. DT will not be President for long. His conflicts of interest will take too much hard work to untangle. He's not trying to find buyers to purchase his assets. That's a MASSIVE national security threat and Ds Need to resist and push back in every way. He's pimping out the presidency with his kids following right in line and his diamond spoon step son Jared as top adviser.All so odd yet predictable. I don't want to know about all the sick inner workings of his businesses and tax evasion strategies. He constantly fails and his failures make him money because he's worked hard at one thing his whole life, being famous. So the only thing he does is put his name on shit other people build. Then with that money he can purchase property which often fails or somehow scams someone at some point. I couldn't think of a worse leader unless he was constantly drinking bud light like Stone Cold at The Podium in the White House with Stone Cold on Monday Night Raw. Hey I wouldn't put it past him. He's going to be doing crazy orangutan shit every day in office. Excuse me his Board Members will as his children speak for him. He bites off their ideas and makes a decision on Twitter. It's within reason to believe he'll continue to use twitter as his main source of communication and he'll likely take us into more wars. I then wonder is it within reason to believe we will not first hear of his plans to go to war at a podium in the white house where reporters ask questions. He will discredit all journalism in a time it needs to be improved not blocked off. Expect the Unexpected. Nothing predicable about this election."

damx5bl,bigbendalibra,"The reason why it doesn't piss me off is because we expect Obama to fight a progressive battle while we, as a people, elect more conservatives to fight against him. So I just shrug my shoulders at what could have been."
danb9tn,illiniking04,"Conservatives are elected on a lot of issues but a hardline stance against marijuana is not one of them, at least nationally. Medicinal pot has already passed in a number of red states (Alaska, Montana twice[!], Arizona, North Dakota, Louisiana, and Arkansas) so the idea that moderate/progressive positions on pot are politically untenable, especially for a lame duck, is BS."
dan462u,Syliase,"Okay, so it's entirely valid to want to criticize a lot of Obama's decisions as a president. I'm not the biggest fan of ""we're going to stop engaging in the Middle East... buuuut here's some drones to kill kids with"". That said, I have no doubt that Obama's at the very least more progressive than most other Democrats. Remember, though, that as President, you don't make laws. You can pass laws, and you can push for or support submitted policies, or ask a member of Congress (possibly) to propose a law/policy. But when you've got a Republican dominated Congress throughout most of your Presidential stint that /actively opposes/ literally everything that you do, then it's much harder to push for laws. It's one of the reasons, actually, why the ACA is such a shit show. That said, also remember that in his first time, the GOP weren't nearly as malicious as they were during his second. We can only guess what's actually going on in the White House, but from what I know of the federal government, it's mainly the grid-locking system that really fucks shit up for everyone involved, and the nuances of policies and execution of policies."
danbov4,illiniking04,">It's one of the reasons, actually, why the ACA is such a shit show.What do Republicans have to do with the ACA? The Democrats had the votes to pass it through both houses and get it on Obamas desk, they did that without a single vote from Republicans so I'm not sure how you can blame them for the content of a bill they unanimously voted against."
danc7t9,Syliase,"Okay, so, you know how the House and Senate, after passing a bill, is supposed to essentially iron out the bill again, so it's the same bill in both House and Senate (because when a bill is introduced at first, it's usually changed in both House and Senate and are almost completely different). Because the Democrats wanted SO badly to pass this bill, they pushed it through so hard that they didn't bother getting it through the joint committees to get that ironing through because they knew that if they took too long to do so, it would involve getting trying to get more Republican support and Republicans in what are supposed to be bipartisan committees to iron out the bill. It's not that it's the Republicans themselves, it's the fact that the opposition was so extreme AND the GOP had a majority, the H & S Democrats didn't do their job. What few Republicans begrudgingly agreed to the ACA in either House or Senate were all they needed, or so they thought, so they didn't bother ironing the ACA out before it was actually executed into federal policy. I'm sorry I didn't clarify that (it's actually in itself just a really long story), but by no means am I trying to accuse the Republicans as being the only reason the ACA is a shit show. Tl;dr- The ACA was sloppily passed and executed because the Democrats refused to work with the Republicans because the Republicans actively opposed everything they tried to pass, especially with the majority."
dancpj2,illiniking04,"> What few Republicans begrudgingly agreed to the ACA in either House or Senate were all they neededPerhaps I'm misunderstanding you but the no one in the GOP voted for the ACA, it was unanimously opposed by Republicans and the 34 Democrats actually voted against in in the House.Also you seem to be stating that the GOP had a majority in Congress, that was not the case when the bill passed (again sorry if I am misunderstanding your post)."
dandwmd,Syliase,"I think I'm not communicating this well, so I'm really sorry. Also, checked my notes from my ConLaw and FedPol classes--we were told that the senate had a Republican minority although technically, the Senate was almost split evenly (not to mention, a lot of moderates on both sides, so right-leaning dems and left-leaning reps), but the house was dominated by the Democrats, led by Joe Biden, against a republican minority which was extremely vocal (so, yes, you're right numbers wise--but in poli-sci, at least from what I've learned, it's less about the numbers and more about the intricacies of voter will, constituency, lobbying, and all that factors into motives). That said, in the senate, all democrats voted for the ACA, and even in the house, it got passed (barely) despite some resistance there as well. Before the opposition could do anything to repeal it, the Dems pushed the bill too quickly through the system. Also, fun fact: When the bill was first introduced, it was passed by both H & S despite getting so much backlash by the Republicans. But it's not ~entirely~ true that the Republicans unanimously went against the ACA because none of them wanted it. In fact, some of the provisions of the ACA came from a past bill the Reps themselves tried to pass a couple decades before. I remember in class, we had a discussion on 'why the sudden change' and a lot of it had to do with the fact that it was more welfare, less private care. Not only that, but after the bill was enacted, all criticisms of the ACA were pretty valid, too, considering that it was not ironed out correctly whatsoever. Does that make sense? Again, sorry if I'm not being clear, a lot of this stuff I admit I'm trying to summon from the top of my head instead of digging through my notes. I'm trying to explain, though, that the process of federal policy being created and executed is more complicated than most people think with this example."
dan6rd3,Real_Junky_Jesus,>So many people are sitting in jail for what **most Americans** agree is no worse than alcohol or tobacco.Including Obama himself. It really makes no sense. The president says it should be legal. More than 50% of America thinks it should be legal. Even Trump says it should be up to the individual states. Why the fuck is marijuana still a federal crime?
damsjtb,PGL593,"> So many people are sitting in jail for what most Americans agree is no worse than alcohol or tobacco. [...] >pisses me off that he is just now making a ""statement"" regarding his beliefs and yet is choosing to do nothing.Obama has commuted the sentences of over 700 federal inmates, many of them non-violent drug offenders.

damv2xo,Teddinator,"I agree it isn't nothing, but it's a very small token considering how many probably remain in prison for the exact same thing. And it does nothing to stop it from continuing to happen. I'm just very disappointed that as a country we cannot come to our senses about this issue. I'm afraid the special interest groups are still to powerful to allow this to happen and that is a damn shame."
damxg1u,marshall19,I was just about to comment on how many sentences he has comminuted... and it is pretty amazing but there is so much more he could do that he isn't. As the president you have the ability to specifically direct how the DEA operates -- ANNNDDD there were more arrest under Obama than Bush. He also kept on Bush's directer Michele Leonhart who repeatedly wouldn't admit marijuana is less harmful to a person than meth/heroin/etc. in front of congress. It is really pathetic.
damurn3,DrVanBuren,Why doesn't he do more? I think because he's scared of Republican backlash. It's sad how Obama is scared of doing the right thing because crazy Republicans will criticize him.
damzglz,js155306,"That's such a bullshit cop-out argument. It was plausible during his first term, but the vast majority of Republican politicians and voters labeled him the absolute devil a long time ago.He has nobody to answer to at this point but his own legacy and personal interests, and he's still not doing more. He has no reason to give a single fuck what Republicans say at this point, especially now that his party has lost the presidency, the house and the senate. There is no more backlash to fear - the worst case scenario has already transpired.There is now no fathomable excuse for his executive actions/lack thereof other than the fact that he truly doesn't want to go any further than he already has, either because it doesn't benefit him personally or he believes it doesn't benefit the country. At some point, you have to face the reality that he either isn't actually on your side or he lacks the fortitude to accomplish what you elected him to do. ""He's scared of backlash"" is not a valid defense for a lame duck president whose party has already lost the executive and legislative branches."
damy6jg,karl4319,"He is a corporatist. Same as both Clintons and most democrats. He just sounds like a populist or a progressive sometimes. Anyone who actually understood what the ACA was doing (use tax money to force people to buy from private companies) should have realized what he was years ago. I think if he would actually try to fight the good fight, he would have counted as a decent president., despite the massive problems he started/expanded (fast and furious program and the NSA surveillance state to name a few). As it stands, he will be remembered only as the first black president, and not accomplishing anything past his terms."
danbj6r,illiniking04,"> Anyone who actually understood what the ACA was doing (use tax money to force people to buy from private companies) should have realized what he was years ago.Yup private insurance, and the incentive to purchase it through an employer, is the biggest problem with healthcare in America. The worst thing anyone could have done is give private insurers an even bigger advantage by mandating the purchase of their services. Either a free market approach where consumers are directly responsible for their cost of their care or a single payer system where the government uses it bargaining power to lower prices is a better system. The ACA is the worst of both worlds."

Like criminal records no longer being held against people when looking for a job. He mentioned it...and never did anything about it. I don't have a record but it seems common sense if someone can't get a good job they will go right back to crime
damw94s,TBirdFirster,"I think that's a little bit reductionist. He's the head of his party, and whether we like it or not big pharma pays for elections. It's easy for us to say ""fuck everything and do what you want"" but he has other obligations. I'm not happy about it, but I can empathize a little. Power in a democracy is a double edged sword: the more you wield, the more consequences follow."
damxk3p,Teddinator,"I agree that there are a lot of special interests: private prisons, police unions, big pharma, etc. As the head of the party, and as a president that ran with the campaign slogan of ""change"", many people had high hopes that he would address the issue irregardless of the money being shoveled to oppose it. The consequences were minimized in his second term as he can't seek reelection. And it's not about doing ""what he wants"", it's about doing whats right. I've heard the war on drugs being referred to as ""Vietnam 2"". It's a senseless, unwinnable war. For the thousands sitting in jail, many black, for what basically amounts to a crime against yourself, this was a missed opportunity to make things right."
damxqxj,TBirdFirster,"I totally agree with everything you're saying. 13th was such a dope documentary talking about this shit. But my point is because he essentially represents his entire party, him screwing a big special interest could affect other democrats seeking reelection.

danqicn,mikoul,"You're very wrong, I was all-in for Sander and I'm more a leftist socialist. :-) I don't care about political party, I only care about what people do or don't do and Obama did NOT do many things he said he was to do... his lack of courage deceived me a lot.He's not even up to give the pardon to Snowden using blatant false excuses, he is the president that imprisoned the most whistle-blowers, he can say anything like ""I'm with the whistle-blowers"" but his act show the contrary.You seem to lack of critical thinking like the one's who voted for Trump. ;-)"

dan7f6r,Tasgall,"The ""infant pot industry"" has way more room to grow than big pharma.

damyacm,akronix10,"It's effectively delayed bribery. Obama knows very well which leaders in industry have deep pockets and a hard on for him just by observing who was warm with the Clintons. That's what I think the original plan was. The Clinton's cleaned up during Obama's terms, then would have dissolved the Clinton Foundation during Hillary's terms allowing Obama to take over with a clean slate. Wash, rinse, repeat. A clean, legal way to establish play now, pay later relationships.Well that was the plan...Something needs to be done.

damxnpk,sean151,"Honest question, what would big pharma do to him if he did something like legalize pot. Send a hit squad? It's not like they can publicly say we got you into office with our money you have to serve our agenda.

damyhvk,Chakra5,"Well, there's really no way to know what's in the man's mind, so your certitude is really just your opinion, as is my own...which is that he does not want to act too aggressively on a matter that the country is still divided on when so many other issues are on the front burner.

damsdx9,Gifs_Ungiven,"Lack of political will, not wanting a public fight with Republicans over weed for fear of alienating older voters, and having other priorities like the economy and Obamacare. Also, the public landscape for weed today is vastly different than it was just a few years ago. The idea of legalization used to be a pipe dream, now it's kind of like gay marriage where it's quickly gaining acceptance."

damyymf,TerroristOgre,Obviously anyone criticising Obama must be an alt right Trump supporter who religiously follows Breitbart...........Jesus Christ. Hes not the first person in politics to be funded by multiple lobbies. I made an error in the wording of my original comment. It's not just big pharma. It's almost every major lobby sector out there that got him into office.Google it man. Or just look at some of the links in the comment replies to my original comments. Plenty of links for you to look at and they aren't from Breitbart
damzlmv,enjoyingtheride,"I don't care about you criticizing Obama, I do it plenty as well. I'm criticizing your choice to group ALL of Reddit as having the opinion of Obama being their favorite president. It's getting old. The way people say ""Reddit"" as a singular pronoun. Have you been to /r/imgoingtohellforthis ? Or /r/the_donald ?It's like me saying all of Reddit has inbred sex with their cousins after watching Jerry Springer in their trailer park, just because of those two subs."
dan0jhf,TerroristOgre,"When people say Americans are fatties who eat cheeseburgers and bang their cousins, does that mean they think EVERY American is a obese cheeseburger gouging redneck?Stop taking things so literally.

dan10hr,enjoyingtheride,"Well, no. It doesn't make every American rednecks. But all those cheeseburger eating inbred cousin banger rednecks browse those two subreddits. I assume some are good people though. /SThere is a circle jerk for everything on this website. It's what triggers you that you see the most. Also, it's not that Obama is charming, it's that he's rational and has carried this country globally with nothing but dignity. When there is a orange faced baboon about to tweet how he thinks India's ambassador needs to lose weight.Get real, and stop getting triggered over Obama's approval rating."
dan1m8a,TerroristOgre,I voted for Obama twice. Stop assuming I'm one of the Donald sub douches. Obama is very charming. Watch some of his non serious interviews etc. The videos where he randomly jogs around DC. Hes a people person.
dan25qp,enjoyingtheride,"I'm not assuming you're one of those people, my point is about your original statement saying Reddit as a singular pronoun doesn't like people critiquing Obama. It's in every thread: Guy wants to be black sheep and break random circle jerk about random social issue regardless of random beliefs and says something random like ""Reddit is a bunch, of random judgment here"".A circle jerk isn't going to end because someone shows how they are not the next in line for a reach around. The universe doesn't just stop spinning because someone went against the grain on their random issue. That's all this is about. Me generalizing white trash people on those two subs has nothing to do with you. It's about saying ""Reddit is all _____""."

dan0k66,IDontHaveLettuce,"Obama has been libertarian on the issue. All about states rights, trump is similar however Jeff sessions is not. Legal weed states have been protected from federal laws under obamas executive order, trump is re-doing all of obamas executive actions, so we will see what sessions and trump will do. I personally think it will be the same as obamas current approach."
dan0o1q,TerroristOgre,Im not a big Trump fan. I was rooting for him in the early primaries but the Donald sub made me rethink what type of douches support him. Made me rethink my support and the company I wanted to be a part of.

danikb2,TomBonner1,Can you expand on this? Obama had a super PAC right? Were his primary donors pharmaceutical companies?
danl54v,TerroristOgre,It was bad wording. I should have said Big Pharma was one of several sectors that funded his campaign.

damv23s,lovely_sombrero,"He got most of his money from big pharma and the banks. Citibank even sent him a list of 30 people they want in his administration and he appointed all of them. He only does lip-service, so his ""legacy"" can at least officially say he was pro-marijuana."

damranl,xtphty,"Because its politically extremely unpopular and would have crippled other more important efforts. Obama has been a heavy moderate when the political landscape needs him to be, but when the timing is right he is as liberal a President as we've had. That is how effective policy making works, you can't just be gung-ho about liberalism and alienate the right whose cooperation you still need the next day. As much as I support legalization, it's definitely one of those last days of a presidential terms kind of issues."
dams4gn,ChuanFaFist,His legacy. Something about being a black president and weed.
damsohf,BonoboBrutus,He does not want to spend political capital on the issue

damtj78,CrustyGrundle,"The important question. He absolutely could have, it and really wouldn't have been that difficult."
damtrax,trippy_grape,Because Trump (or for that matter any future president) can just as easily roll it back. Obama forcing this issue could quickly make a lot of people on the fence resent him and push back for it to be illegal again.
damwlya,theonlybluecow,"Ok, but 8 years ago Trump wasnt on the radar...so what stopped him 8 years ago?"
damtt2z,silentbobsc,"I figure it's because he wants his legacy to be something more than the 'black guy who legalized weed' (extreme oversimplification, yes)."
damu1gj,helpfulkorn,"Because a black president doesn't really want to be the one to reclassify weed, given the racist stereotypes. Same reason he could never be forceful or aggressive in his speeches or risk being an ""angry black man"". Think of how conservatives paint him now, despite the fact that he's fairly moderate. If he truly was liberal, racist conservatives would lose their minds."
damw2un,,How convenient that he's about to leave office.
damwm9u,tbariusTFE,"cause presidents dont usually drop bombs like legalizing a drug mid presidency. if he does, it'll be at the end."
damxcr4,xigua22,"When Obama was first elected only about 40% of people supported legalized marijuana. It's pretty hard to justify legalizing something the majority of the country is against. Only in the last couple years it's been as high as 60%, but it's a difficult call to make when there hasn't been enough research about the positive and negative results of legalized marijuana. We're in a much better place to make the call now, and public support of legalization will only continue to rise, but guinea pigs like Colorado have been critical for learning about the positive effects legalizing marijuana can have."
damyfrg,drkpie,"Shit, he has against cannabis instead. Raid numbers on dispensaries went up, plus he gave more money to the DEA's budget iirc. Yet they have a strain named after him lmfao."
damyhqv,Seventeen34,"I haven't seen this, but probably because it could simply be undone by the next President. If a Democrat followed, the baby steps at DoJ with the states would continue. Now, it's all in jeopardy along with half his legacy."
damzzx6,GG_Henry,all bark no bite
dan0f3v,IDontHaveLettuce,"I believe he ordered an executive order and memorandum for the DOJ to not go after dispensaries in legal weed states unless they were breaking state laws or negligent to other federal laws. Trump said he was going to halt all of obamas executive orders so, it will be interesting to see what trump and Jeff sessions do with it."
dan7fz0,draekia,"Because1) the first black president, from the Democratic Party, going out and doing that would be the death knell of the party/his career. 2) congressional decisions are harder to overturn."
dan94qu,aSaaadPanda,I don't understand how you got so many responses without anybody bringing up the mass pardoning he's been doing for years of nonviolent federal prisoners who are in for drug related crimes.
dan9ssl,,Because he's a whore for big pharma.
danbcfw,trynagetrich,Because he was never gonna do anything about it anyways.
damqru3,moralanarchy,He got high and forgot.
damr9ku,PresidentBartlet2016,Because more people don't agree pot should be legal.
damrkod,cnaiurbreaksppl,That's more wrong than anything I've seen.
damsmhj,PresidentBartlet2016,Just because people in your bubble agrew pot should be legal does not mean the majority of the US does.
damssn3,cnaiurbreaksppl,I believe over 51% of the population in (at least) the us wants it legalized. I'm not sure on the world population.
dan0gba,PresidentBartlet2016,Well then you are severely misinformed.
dan2rav,cnaiurbreaksppl,"[This](http://www.thecannabist.co/2016/10/19/marijuana-legalization-poll-gallup-2016/65663/) says 60% support legalization. So, no."

dan5aau,cnaiurbreaksppl,You're so edgy it's actually hurting me to reply back. Did you even read that article? They got their data [here](http://www.gallup.com/poll/196550/support-legal-marijuana.aspx). We get it. You're one of the 50+% of Republicans not wanting to legalize. You're also a part of the problem.
danit0d,PresidentBartlet2016,No I'm all for legalizing I'm just not naive and realize most people don't feel the same way.
danlfh6,cnaiurbreaksppl,60% of people feel the same way.
dao48ub,PresidentBartlet2016,That's not correct.
dao5ww8,cnaiurbreaksppl,What's the correct number?
damscrh,pushkill,Because he hasnt done jack shit in the past 8 years other than make his donors happy.
damnyfy,LexUnits,Why couldn't he do it earlier?

dammuuj,ThaCarter,A substantial portion of Trump's base is pro-legalization too. He'd have to piss off his own people.
damp684,FadimirGluten,His stance on the stump was always legalize medical across the board and leave recreational up to the states to decide. That would probably entail a rescheduling.
damr5ux,pepedelafrogg,"Good luck with Jeff ""People Who Smoke MJ are Bad"" Sessions as Attorney General."
damtgxe,RubberDuck867,"Trump made a stage full of Republicans kiss his ass, and then made them phonebank for him.

dams96e,DirkDeadeye,Whose also trying to destroy vaping.

dan048r,Sloppy_Twat,Because american politicians are really bad people when it comes down to it and they support really bad people. The entire DNC and RNC are corrupt as fuck and no one seems to care much.

damokq0,Short_Bus_,"He wouldn't have been my pick personally, but I'm willing to reserve judgment until he actually does anything.

damqz25,BurntHotdogVendor,"I'm Pro-legalization but are you honestly saying that a person is selfish, paranoid and delusional for wanting financial and job security over legal marijuana? If that's true, you obviously don't have many responsibilities in life."

damuqgb,OrlandoMagik,"Ok well did you ever consider that the liberal policies that Democrats push ruin a lot of peoples lives and infringe on the rights of innocents, and that you are just looking at it from a different perspective? I want to make it clear that the things I am about to list do not align with my political ideals, but I can still recognize that these are people and that their opinions matter. That is what America is about.So it is totally ok to take away coal miners jobs and ruin their livelihood, or to take away the rights of bar owners to decide whether you can smoke in their bars or not, or to take money out of the pockets of business owners through increased taxes. Democrats want to ruin peoples lives and take away the rights of innocents but you think it is ok because they want to ruin the lives of people that you deem bad people because they don't agree with your political ideals. Do you not see the hypocrisy? Just because you think that you are on some moral high ground doesn't mean that you get to discount the opinions of other people, that is the reason the Dems lost the election this cycle, that is why people talk about liberals being ""elitist""."

damq07j,bmey3002,"Honestly, I think that Trump was pandering to the extreme conservatives on the subjects of marijuana and gay marriage. Given his lifestyle, I find it very hard to believe he is actually against both."

danwmz4,TzunSu,"No, because the supreme court rules on laws, and executive orders do not."
dammk84,Nuranon,"Not if Republicans can get their base angry about how Obama undemocraticly (which wouldn't really be false) pushed through something like that...they would say (like they often do now) that the states should handle it so Trump could reverse it without being the big bad guy, at that pointthe whole process would have to start again only that now Republicans are more enthusiasitic about it. So far Republicans seem to be very sure about revoking Obamacare - that would mean 20+M people lose their insurance (which should be magnitudes less popular than revoking pot legalization), yes they will likely time it well and all but they don't seem to be fucking around, hell, they almost didn't increase the debt ceiling."
damn5x0,iushciuweiush,">undemocraticly (which wouldn't really be false)Of course it would be. The classification of drugs is done at an agency level. There is no 'democratic' process involved in it at all. >.they would say (like they often do now) that the states should handle it so Trump could reverse it without being the big bad guy This is the opposite of reality. 'Descheduling' marijuana doesn't make it legal per federal law, it makes it 'not illegal' per federal law. For instance alcohol is not illegal by federal law but states, counties, and cities have the right to ban alcohol sales and set their own drinking ages. ONLY with it descheduled would states *actually* have a say in whether it is legal or not in their own state. While it's still scheduled, technically states have no right to legalize it because federal law trumps state law. 'Rescheduling' marijuana after it's been descheduled would actually be doing the exact opposite of what you are implying by going against the concept of 'states rights.'"
damom5x,PM-Me-Your-BeesKnees,"Why is it undemocratic for an elected leader to do something well within their scope of power while in office? That was the point of having the election that made them President in the first place.EDIT: Particularly when that something has to do with how we treat a controlled substance. I understand why it would be ""undemocratic"" for an elected leader to turn around and use their power to pass legislation that strips people of their voting rights, for example. To me, to be undemocratic should require you to actually oppose a democratic value, not just do something while President."
damohuy,Chaos20X6,>it would make Trump look like the bad guyI think Trump wants to look like the bad guy
damqobu,iushciuweiush,"What would make you think that? He portrayed himself as the 'defiant guy' during the election, not the 'bad guy.' Many decided what he was saying/doing *was* bad but that wasn't the image he was going for and he didn't need those peoples votes."
dampc71,BJJJourney,Depends on what he is bribed with.
damphyr,proROKexpat,"Honestly Trump could make it be a massive win if Obama doesn't do it. he comes into office says ""alright folks I wanna do something good for America, far too many people are going to prison for smoking pot. So I'm going go ahead and deschedule"""
damql8c,iushciuweiush,I mean technically if he was passionate about 'leaving it to the states' he would do it anyway because that is the only way to ensure that states *actually* have the right to ban/legalize it. Right now they don't have the right to decide even though they are going ahead and doing it 'defiantly' anyway.
damqt0k,Kanye_Westeroz,> and it would make Trump look like the bad guy.That would be the thing that would make Trump look like a bad guy?
damr6n2,iushciuweiush,*The* bad guy specifically on Marijuana and states rights.
damqt5x,Top-Cheese,And he wouldn't have to be the one to reschedule it and piss off his crazy conservatives base. But I do feel a slight majority of Trump supporters would want it decriminalized.
damrwwa,CreamOnMyNipples,"Ah yes, it's always a win whenever the president looks like a bad guy..."
damsdb6,stolersxz,He would 100% reverse it in favour of states getting to chose
damt498,iushciuweiush,"That's not how drug scheduling works. Right now states do *not* get to choose because federal law trumps state law. Removing it from the list of banned substances would not legalize it at the federal level, it would give the choice back to the states. Reversing it would go against 'states right to choose.' It's easier to understand when you think of it like alcohol. Alcohol is not legal or illegal at the federal level which is why individual states are allowed to set their own laws regarding the sale of alcohol. There are still many counties and cities around the country that ban it and technically entire states could if they wanted to."
damsmep,untraiined,Not necessarily just because it seems the right thing to you doesnt mean it is. Its better to convince people that pot is on the level of cigs and alcohol than just straight up make a law and piss them off. If trump started enacting gun rights laws without explaining them you would be pissed. But if he lobbied for them and tried to convince the populace that is against him its better and lays the groundwork for future laws to take effect and remain permanent.
damsto4,iushciuweiush,> than just straight up make a law and piss them offNo one is suggesting anyone 'straight up make a law' here. He would be *removing* regulations from an already existent law. It's technically win-win for both the left and the right because it would be decriminalizing marijuana at the federal level while giving rights back to the states to regulate it themselves.
damzy8k,PoshVolt,Trump already looks like the bad guy.
dan309r,JonEqualsBum,Trump said he's good with medical marijuana and pretty sure he said it can be up to the states to legalize it or not
dan8c4h,yourMentorsSomberVoi,"Correct, but it would be a major win-win. Trump could say that he has to many other things currently on his plate to deal with and he will get to it, allowing those sweet sweet taxes to start rolling in.I have been saying this since it was put up for vote (I am a resident of Colorado and I voted for Prop 64):The Public and the Government love the green. Just different types of it. In this case, one leads to the other."

It's a cult of personality that allows him to get away with anything."
dams8ee,youreabigbiasedbaby,Actually it would take him years to get it rescheduled.

damn66a,Nuranon,"I think you are overestimating how much the average voter cares for marijuana, sure the majority of the population might dislike the decission but consider that the people who presumebly would hate it most vote the least (millenials). Given that and more pressing issues like the situation of Muslims, Gay marriage, abortion etc the issue would just be a minor one (even if it might be terrible for lot of people in chronic pain).And consider people have short memories...4 years are long in politics, most people will forget or not care enough to vote differently. And even if, its not like he will loose the majority in both houses because of it so he can happily govern away and the effect on republican sentators and representatives would be minimal since it would just be Trump reversing an executive order, they could be sceptical in public if that would give them an advantage in their state, district."

dami8t1,ellenpaosanus,"true, but that didn't stop him from issuing other executive orders."
damich7,swozey,I'm *hoping* he's working on a more permanent method instead of an executive order for it. His EO's are going to be thrown to the wind next year. But it is pretty late now.
damnbw6,libretti,What would that more permanent method look like? Does it need to pass through the house and senate first?
dampge2,fnordfnordfnordfnord,"A more permanent method would take drugs classification completely away from the DEA or any other law enforcement agency, and put it in the hands of the CDC or a committee of public health officials, doctors, and scientists. That, or just gut the Controlled Substances Act."
damnfkw,swozey,I listened to a Podcast a few months ago that actually laid out some good alternatives. I don't remember at all what they were now because I have the memory of an ant. I'll try to dig them up tonight when I've got time. It was specifically about Obamas options regarding de-scheduling mj and what his best and worst options were (worst being EO).This is a very good breakdown of the system in the mean time; https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2015/02/13/how-to-reschedule-marijuana-and-why-its-unlikely-anytime-soon/
damitgd,ellenpaosanus,"He had 8 years and did nothing on the marijuana front. Obama bent over backwards for illegal immigrants, gays, transgendered people, ect each time acting unilaterally with an EO. Marijuana is clearly not a priority for this administration, if it was they would have already done something about it.Hillary was against marijuana and obama has done nothing for marijuana. I voted for bernie in the primary and trump in the general election in part because the democrats inaction on marijuana legalization on the federal level. When the dems put up someone who is serious about legalizing, then ill consider voting for their candidate again."
damj8gu,Isord,"If you voted against the inaction of Democrats on the issue, why would you vote for Trump? He is going to go the exact opposite direction. I wouldn't be surprised to see drug raids starting up again in states that have legalized under Jeff Sessions."
damjsam,ellenpaosanus,"8 years of hillary would mean no progress at all. At least now the dems have a chance to elect a candidate that supports legalization 4 years from now. Trump wants to leave it up to the states, that's pretty much what we have now."
damn7hx,swozey,"This would make sense until you look at who Trump has placed into office (AG Sessions). ""More of the same,"" meant the Federal Govt staying hands off when it comes to the States that have legalized mj (post Cole Memo). This is what Obama started doing the last few years and why Washington, CO, etc are able to sell it to adults. For all we know this group of anti-mj folk he's selected will tell the Govt to actually enforce the Federal laws where it's a Schedule 1.Will Trump leave it up to the States when Federally it's illegal? He's the demon that we *don't* know. And Sessions hasn't had a pro-mj past at all."
damnjo9,ellenpaosanus,"Well to be fair, before the election we had no way of knowing who either of them would have appointed. And trump has said hes leaving it up to the states so far."
damnlgo,swozey,We'll see. I hope for the best.
damkfbe,Scorwegian,"There are plenty of valid criticisms of Hillary Clinton and her likely policies, but would you care to clarify what you mean by ""no progress at all""?"
damkjh2,ellenpaosanus,I mean when chelsea clintion spews bullshit about people who died from drug complication and interactions after smoking weed in Colorado.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/28/chelsea-clinton-misspoke-on-marijuana-risks-spokeswoman-says/That is DARE level stupidity.
dams3uf,Scorwegian,"Yes, that was a perplexing thing that Chelsea said. However, I don't think Hillary spoke out specifically against marijuana, and she tends (or rather tended) to make grand gestures according to what was popular at the time - which I really think would have resulted in a continuing trend towards legalization both medical and recreational.At this point I suppose it's a moot point what she would have done, that's an alternate timeline we will not get to see"
damn86c,nerdyintentions,"Hillary's opinion could have ""evolved"" on the issue as public support continues to grow. Similar to how Obama's position on gay marriage ""evolved"".I don't think its fair to say that there was no hope of any progress if Hillary won."
damniv2,ellenpaosanus,"Im not going to vote for someone and hope they evolve. If they want my vote, do the evolving before i cast my ballot."
damo7em,nerdyintentions,"Yeah, but in this case we talking about making a decision between two candidates who do not share your opinion. So its not as if you voted for someone who didn't need to evolve...you're just saying I'm going to vote the guy who is most likely to be anti-Marijuana in the hope that causes pro-legalization opposition to form that results in a pro-legalization Presidential candidate in 4 years. But that is no more of a guarantee then Hillary's position evolving. In fact, I'd say that if you had that much support in 4 years then its very, very likely Hillary's position would have evolved in that time. So you get that Candidate without having to endure 4 years of Trump."
dan8woc,ellenpaosanus,"Yeah, but 4 years of trump gives me a lifetime of lulz though. Hillary has been anti drugs forever, she wouldnt have been a savior to the marijuana smokers at all."
damqyw0,huxtiblejones,"I cannot believe there are still idiots like you saying shit like this after we ended up with Trump. The Hillary delusions are disgusting and largely fueled by misinformation and right wing propaganda. You got played, dumbass, thanks for fucking our country up."
damr7sc,ellenpaosanus,"If you supported hillary, you got played. She blew it, royally. All the wasted resources and she still couldn't get people to come out and support her.America isnt fucked up, its going to be great again!"
damrfiu,Bipolar_Chihuahua,"Jeff Sessions hates pot heads and liberals. There is no way he is going to let any hippy liberals in Colorado, California, and Washington smoke weed. You just lost all your legalization privileges."
damric1,ellenpaosanus,"Trump is sessions boss and he says hes leaving it up to the states. I am currently smoking freely, legalization privileges in tact."
damrp8k,Bipolar_Chihuahua,He's not president until January 20th 2017. Trump ran on law and order. It's against federal law. Enjoy your privilege while Obama is still in office.
damrvdf,ellenpaosanus,"If trump attacks medical and recreational pot, ill smoke like i did when bush and clinton were president. It always has been against federal law, but that has never stopped me from enjoying it.Trump is a populist though, hes not going to do something as unpopular as attacking medical pot. 3 states that voted solid for trump also overwhelmingly passed medical laws, hes not going to spit in their face."
damsewa,Bipolar_Chihuahua,Trump has to start making decisions instead of saying anything and everything to get elected. Some people are not going to like some of the decisions he has to make. His decisions will be greatly affected by those around him since he doesn't know what he is doing. Jeff Sessions hates weed smokers and is going to do everything in his power to shut you down.
damsq37,ellenpaosanus,"Trump also probably want to get re-elected. So instead of spending time and energy doing things he said he wasn't going to do, he will likely spend time and energy trying to half way implement the grand claims and policies he actually proposed. Im not a big sessions fan, but im not a loretta lynch fan or eric holder fan either. No point in arguing about it really, only time will tell."
damjhwb,,"Well that was a fucking stupid thing to do, I hope you know thatdid you somehow miss who trump was surrounding himself with? did you miss the many times Christie and that lunatic Rudy spoke out against states rights and legalization?Are you at least willing to now say you were conned since it's so obvious?"
damm76u,theslip74,"Single issue voters like you are fucking scum, and this is coming from someone whose #1 PERSONAL issue is legalization. When I choose who to vote for, I take everything into account, not just the issue that will effect me. I think it's pretty selfish for me to be more concerned with myself legally smoking weed than for, say, making sure minorities are treated as equals.Also, though legalization may not have been a priority of Obamas administration, the steps he has taken such as telling his AG to lay off the raids, have done far more for the movement than any other president. I agree that he didn't go far enough, but I'm happy with the steps he did take at least.Fuck you, you're a selfish piece of shit."
dammlmc,ellenpaosanus,"People like me are the reality. You can be angry or you can try to win our vote. Im selfish as fuck, and im gonna keep voting that way. Being selfish is human nature, you are selfish too, you just dont realize it. Im glad that i can make you so mad though by voting and exercising my rights. Thanks for sharing your butthurt so publicly for me to enjoy."
damn6gk,theslip74,"I don't give a fuck about your vote, the reality is the left needs to get its supporters to get out an fucking vote, not pander to degernates. Trump won with less votes than Romney lost with, we don't need your support, we need another charismatic politician."
damndcb,ellenpaosanus,"I agree, hillary was about the worst choice the dems could have made. Almost anyone else would have won, but the dems were too dense to understand how much your typical american hates hillary."
damnryn,theslip74,"Yup, agreeing 100% here. I was pro-Bernie too. There was a brief period after it was clear that he lost that I entertained the idea of voting for Trump. I spent about a week watching his speeches and trying to decipher his policies, and landed on a firm ""not a chance in fucking hell.""I did the same thing for Hillary, and expected to find a ton of shit that would make me not want to vote for her, but I was surprised to find the reality is that she's a remarkably clean politician. Yeah, maybe some of her views are different now than they were in the 90's, but thats A GOOD THING. I remember when Colbert was roasting W during the 2006 press correspondents dinner, he said this:>The greatest thing about this man is he's steady. You know where he stands. He believes the same thing Wednesday that he believed on Monday, no matter what happened Tuesday. Events can change; this man's beliefs never will.That's dead on. I want a politician who takes reality into account when governing."
dan91il,ellenpaosanus,"> reality is that she's a remarkably clean politicianlol, in these parts shes known as crooked hillary. Remarkably clean, like her email server that she wiped with a cloth. It brought me such great joy watching the people, especially the children, crying when they found out she lost.

daml8jv,frontierparty,"> If obama is intimidated by those kind of headlines, then maybe hes not cut out for the job.Man, you are so enlightened."
damlat1,ellenpaosanus,"Enlightened and i vote, Fuck you too."
damlkqy,frontierparty,"Wow, a voter. What a special creature. Well I hope your one vote legalizes marijuana soon."
damlry2,ellenpaosanus,"Im a special breed of voter, the angry rust belt voter who stopped hillary from becoming president. People like me decided the election so i guess that is kind of special. Anyways,marijuana is already legal for me so dont waste your hopes on me."
damlw8h,frontierparty,So people who don't know how to find a job. America is really gonna suck for you in a few years. Hope you get that weed fast. You're gonna need it.
damm0yz,ellenpaosanus,"I already have the weed, i grow and sell it to dispensaries by the lb. That is my job, and it pays very well! Part of the reason i didn't like Clinton, her taxes would have cost me alot of money."
damm656,frontierparty,So you have a job selling weed and you make a lot of money and you are still an angry rustbelt voter? Talk about insufferable. What a miserable life to just hate for the sake of hating.
damn6kt,The_Man_on_the_Wall,He grows and sells weed. This is against federal law. Sessions is now going to enforce it. So they bust down the dispensary he sells to. They give out the name of their growers and the DEA kicks his door down and now he's got a nice 10 year bit.And he voted for it as a single issue voter. So this guy just voted to have his business shut down and his freedom taken away. And he's bragging about it on the fucking internet. Thats fucking powerful stupid.
dammfrv,ellenpaosanus,"lol miserable isnt quite the word i was thinking of, more like a dank life if you ask me.How am i hateful?"
damm2ag,The_Man_on_the_Wall,"Yes, but then Trump is fucked. See if Obama does this then Trump is painted into a corner. Right now if Obama leaves it alone Trump has the ole "" i am just enforcing existing federal laws"" caveat. BUT if Obama reschedules THEN Trump changes that then he goes back on his previous word and he actually has to TAKE ACTION to reverse it. Will expose his hypocrisy sooner than he wants. This is the trap Obama must lay before he leaves. Its not just good policy, its amazing politics."
damwsza,CardcaptorRLH85,"However, Obama also doesn't want to actually deal with any potential issues arising from rescheduling (or de-scheduling) marijuana during his actual Presidency. If he does it, I'm sensing a midnight or early morning EO on January 20th just before leaving office just to make sure that he doesn't have to deal with the small number of idiots who will, of course, partake and operate motor vehicles causing accidents."
damig0n,americanrabbit,"It could be, but that onus falls on them then."
damknrt,Xelif,"Yep, but it forces them to take a visible and unpopular action rather than just quietly ramp up enforcement of laws on the books."
damm0nr,iushciuweiush,"Ok... so, how is this a reason not to do it again?"
damnyn6,Bumblelicious,"And that's great, because it will be *enormously* unpopular with everyone. On the left for liberty reason and on the right for states rights issues. This paints the GOP into a corner. He's being *dumb* by not doing this *yesterday.*"
damlb6v,,There would be riots. If they want riots that's how you do it.
damm98b,Michelle-Obamas-Arms,A weed riot would be the chillest riot of them all.
damowgt,PM-Me-Your-BeesKnees,"That's true, but it also then changes the status quo. Right now, Trump can avoid the issue through inaction and leave it illegal. There's a certain amount of inertia and maybe future Presidents, Trump included, don't want to go to the trouble of stirring the pot on that issue. Maybe they avoid the issue and leave it legal instead."
damwllz,epawtows,"Somehow I think that would be one of the first orders Trump would reverse, with much glee."
damkb1w,frontierparty,Trump plans to undo all his Executive Orders.
dampacs,Zoltrahn,"Which is a ridiculous claim. Another issue he will backtrack on. He will certainly undo a lot of them, many of them being very important, but he won't undo every single one like he has promised."
dammzj3,Any-sao,"Yes, but the process would take a while. Penalties would need to be adjusted and processing procedures would need to be rewritten. Then there is the debate if that means that it would be sellable by legal vendors, or if the penalties are simply lessened. He could order it tomorrow, but it would ultimately be within Trump's term that the process would be completed. And who's to say that the President-Elect would not simply repeal it?"
damq1gn,ATLiving,Agreed. Where the hell was he with this the past 8 years? Convenient to say something in your last month of office but still not take any action. Sad.
damq49i,Kame-hame-hug,Which would be of zero significance in Feb 2017
damqrc7,DDuub,DEA has to change it. Executive order wouldn't work.
damqxw6,PazDak,"He legally can't do that. He can publish his wishes by Executive order, but he does not have the legal authority to force a department to change policy. His guidance is at the time of selecting directors and issuing guidance. He simply can't just say ""legalize weed"" and it would be done."
damr86t,zzellers,"Y'all want your weed that bad, huh?"
dams057,americanrabbit,Gonna need it to get through next 4 years.
damsoab,NotSureNotRobot,Of an ounce of dank
damt392,RealityIsMyReligion,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/35vz07/can_the_president_issue_an_executive_order_to/cr8cnkr/
damum4k,gohatters,The issue with that is t that it can be undone just as easily
damuszs,americanrabbit,And thus pissing off some of trumps base
damurif,BergenCountyJC,"An Obama era executive order I could get behind, never thought I'd see the day."
damv3pf,Cenex,"Not that easy. Congress has already explicitly proscribed a specific process to add or remove drugs from a schedule.>Rules of the Attorney General under this subsection shall be made on the record after opportunity for a hearing pursuant to the rulemaking procedures prescribed by subchapter II of chapter 5 of Title 5.21 U.S.C. 811(a).So no, he can't simply order it be removed from the schedule, because that would be easily overturned in court for not having any authority by statute. ""On the record"" means it has to be a formal rulemaking procedure under the Administrative Procedure Act. Most regulations get passed via informal rulemaking, which is relatively easy and nearly impossible to overturn in court. Formal procedures require notice and a hearing, among other strict procedural requirements, and you can bet a lot of interested parties would be all up in that opposing it. And the decision would also of course be challenged in court."
damw6cm,2chainzzzz,Not accurate.
damwaw8,tjmax,I don't think Obama wants to do an executive order on legalizing pot. It wouldn't be law. The presidents job is to enforce laws. Congress creates laws and the Supreme Court interprets them. States would jump all over this and would sue. Not gonna happen
damwvuc,DaggerMoth,And then Trump reverses it just because it was something Obama did. Then makes his own executive order descheduling it and takes all the credit.
damxmaw,redditproha,But can't the next president reverse the EO?
damyp0y,,An executive order could be overturned in no time when trump takes office. I fear that republicans will be going after pot if Obama is in favor of it.
dan1x7b,KingBubzVI,"Executive orders are BS, and circumvent the checks and balances put in place by the Constitution. There's a time and a place for them, but not on a whim to make any change he wants. Because god knows Trump is going to abuse the fuck out of them, and Obama used them more than any POTUS in history, so I think we need to dial them back before they get out of hand."
dan1zed,americanrabbit,"Lol. Bush made more eo than obama. Check your facts mate. http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/orders.php Executive orders have ALWAYS been a part of the power of the presidency. They dont create laws, they interpret how they are enforced. Hell per year hes made less than every president since CLEVELAND"
dan2hpo,KingBubzVI,"You're right- I had my numbers off. Laziness on my part, one of my pals said this and took him at face value. One thing that strikes me is the massive dichotomy between executive orders put in place by the earlier presidents and the later ones. I wonder how they would take ~30 orders a year vs 1 or 2"
dan2mki,americanrabbit,"Its exponential. The more laws you have, the more you have to interpret to enforce. Especially with grant post civil war.Whats more amazing is how FEW obama has issued compared to every 20th century president.Fox news is dangerous. Just another example of the lies they spew."
dan32o9,KingBubzVI,"You say it's exponential, but the numbers on that chart show otherwise. It peaked with FDR (perhaps the president most responsible for expanding the powers of the executive branch) at 307/yr. The previous 6 presidents averaged 204/yr.And since FDR, there has been a marked downward trend. So, yeah, Obama did put out a remarkably few amount of executive orders, but there does not seem to be an exponential relationship with time and EOs"
dan4sha,americanrabbit,"Well technically teddy roosevelt began the real executive expansion, but my overall point was that obama has been the most reserved of any modern president to issue eo's.Trump on the other hand i feel will return to fdr levels."
dan5wi6,KingBubzVI,I agree
dan3wvu,Rodot,Executive orders can only constitutionally be used to enforce existing law. There is no legal way for him to reschedule through executive order. He's not a king after all.
dan72j3,exodus7871,"No, you can't just make an executive order to overwrite a law by passed by Congress. Jesus fucking christ."
dan7zuy,MrPumkin,"Executive orders cannot make law, only change how its enacted. I know he could make the order than no arrests can be made for any marajuana related crime, but other than that what order could he give?"
dan840t,americanrabbit,"By executive order, he can reshuffle the dea to reschedule."
dan841i,,>least amount*fewest number
dan8gn1,ThePopesFace,> Obama issued the least amount of executive orders per year since grover cleveland.Tell that to my facebook page.
dan8ooz,americanrabbit,Lol post my link and hear crickets
danj18j,Joekw22,"My dad told me that he enacted the most executive actions of ANY president EVER. I had to calmly explain to him that he most definitely has not. Fake news has got to stop, it's getting ridiculous."
danp86r,americanrabbit,Its up to us to arm ourselves with facts
dano121,BoilerMaker11,"LMAO. A conservative buddy of mine likes to call Obama a ""dictator"" because he ""just puts out an executive order whenever he doesn't get what he wants"".I already knew that he gave less than Bush and argue ""Bush gave more. What does that make him?"". But the least per year since Cleveland? Oh, I'm rubbing it in his face immediately."
danpdki,americanrabbit,And its technically the least since clevelands FIRST term
danowm5,,"Thank you. They love to say how much he has ""abused"" the Executive Order."
dan8xrj,LiquidRitz,"There is little Difference between [Presidential Memoranda, Presidential Action and Executive Orders.] (http://truthinmedia.com/reality-check-obama-actually-issued-exec-action-president-modern-history/). MWhen combined he has created and passed more laws than any president by far. He gave commander and chief authorization to Hillary as SOS 10 times in her last year with a combined $104 million in DOD funds."
dangvpd,americanrabbit,Please cite academic sources. Truthinmedia is not a credible source.
danrrkl,LiquidRitz,On /r/politics? I won't waste my time...
damtv78,seruko,"technically the DEA is in control of the schedule, however the DEA reports to the Attorney General (who is a member of President's cabinet and a subordinate of the President). So in theroy Obama could turn to the AG and say ""Loretta take Marijuana off the schedule"" and that's that."
damq2ya,biskitwheels,"Federal courts need to address the commerce clause lawsuit that they've been sitting on since the '70's, god damn it""The Commerce Clause of the Constitution is used to justify federal regulation of marijuana. This clause gives the federal government the right to regulate interstate commerce. Why shouldn't states have this ability?One reason the founders created the commerce clause was to prevent states from imposing trade barriers on each other."""
damo57x,,Schedule 2 is not good enough. We want full recreational legalization
damjhxg,ProsecutorMisconduct,"He can direct the Attorney General to start the re-scheduling process. The problem is even that won't do it, there are organizations that have a vested interest in Marijuana being illegal that have to submit recommendations, and the attorney general is most likely bound by those recommendations."
damqzi6,drplump,The AG can reschedule it on their own.
damr91x,,Time to call our senators.
damrydm,,"He would need to reappoint the head of the DEA, which he can't do without them first resigning."
damxrsm,karl4319,"Executive order to the DEA to deschedule it and put it under the FDA or ATF, like all over-the-counter drugs. He could do this in a day if he chooses to."
dan0w2e,PM_ME_REPTILES,"He could have accomplished it at any point, but no, now it's too late"
dancks1,,It came up for rescheduling like 6 months ago and he reaffirmed it as schedule 1. The guy us full of shit! ( I voted for him 2x)
danpjy7,,Dont hold your breath. He is by and far a do nothing president who talks pretty. Nothing will come of this.
damimoe,crazyfingersculture,8 years too late.
damrs3q,weewolf,"Ex-politician: Says something I agree with and could have changed when their were in office but did not. Next at 11, dog bites man."
damueg3,ExtremeHeat,Except that he still is in office. It's not a decision he gets to make.
damxfy4,Reefer-eyed_Beans,"That can't be true! He said this sort of stuff all the time on the campaign trail before he got elected. It was only during that 8 year window, when the DEA started cracking down on marijuana even harder, that he seemed to forget. So it's not that he's too late... just a very bad coincidence of timing before and after./s"
damozwp,Reddisaurusrekts,Exactly. I'm tired of Obama saying the right things but doing jack all.
damqid9,jarsnazzy,You must be new to the Democratic party

damx7nw,eximil,Splitting off into another party would be terrible for advancing a progressive agenda. It's better to try to change the Democrats from within.
dan33hm,,"The Tea Party kind of did that, not really a centralized party, but a movement intended to take the Republican Party rightwards. And it worked. However there isn't an equivalent on the left, cue Progressive Party."
danars2,sustainably_extinct,"> However there isn't an equivalent on the left, cue Progressive Party.The danger there is: (and I am an advocate for a 3rd party) - we've seen a lot of 3rd parties come and go over the years. Natural Law Party. Constitution Party. Rent's Too Damn High Party. Libertarian Party. Independent Party. Reform Party. ""Lieberman for Connecticut"", ... and the Greens. All of them seem to be addicted to running absolutely batshit crazy bottom-of-the-barrel eccentric weirdos. Jill Stein was reasonably acceptable; and I think she did well against the mainstream character assassination they ran against her. But her VP pick was... unfortunate. I would LOVE to see a Progressive Party gain some traction. I would hate to see it get sabotaged by the ""crystal healers"" crowd."
daon92t,,"Right, with people like Sen. Sanders/Sen. Warren at the forefront I believe a lot of far left democrats disassified with the party and democratic establishment would join on."
dan0x53,jarsnazzy,"Rebelling from darth Vader and the empire would be terrible. We should work to change them from within. I know they have a good heart.I know smoking is bad, that's why I work for Phillip morris, because change comes from with, and that's how we will stop people from being harmed by cigarettes."
dan3yt1,Human-Infinity,"Those are some pretty terrible analogies.The reason why splitting into 2 parties would be awful is that it just ensures that Republicans will win future elections. For example, if 30% want the Democrat candidate, and 30% want the candidate from this new progressive party, then the Republican with 40% will end up with more votes, despite being the least preferred candidate by the other 60% of the country.To use your Star Wars analogy, it would be like if the rebels split into 2 separate groups and began fighting each other while also still fighting the empire. Needless to say, that's not a very good strategy.Edit: Just to be clear, I strongly dislike this 2-party system, but we will need to change to a more proportional system before other parties can ever be successful. Until that happens, splitting the party will do more harm than good."
danau60,sustainably_extinct,Democrats are already trying to capture Center and Center Right votes. They've totally abandoned Progressives. The Progressives have nothing to lose here.
dan4w72,snafudud,"Do you ever wonder why half the country doesn't vote? Maybe if there were more parties to vote for, that non-voting half of the country would find it easier to vote for a party that speaks to them, rather than having to settle for this either/or system. Maybe if there was 4 parties, two extreme sides, two moderate sides, there would be different alliances, and make ups. This thinking that everything has to be 50/50, splitting is terrible, is what allows this bullshit to continue in the first place."
dan6fq3,Human-Infinity,"Perhaps I wasn't clear about what I meant. I definitely do not like the 2-party system that forces people to vote for the ""lesser of 2 evils"". I'd much prefer a proportional system like most other developed democracies have. I was just saying that if one of the parties split under the current system, it wouldn't work out well for them. We need to change the system to actually be representative before other parties will ever have any long-term success."
daoa7eq,sdoorex,"Where the hell are all these voters for third parties that you keep talking about?

daoj8zp,snafudud,"I mean in the sense of if the bulk of the Democratic progressive wing broke off from the centrist part of the party, and vis-versa with the tea party wing of Republicans. Where there were real contenders for major parties, that win seats at every level of government, and not disparate tiny third parties. Like what many, many other countries have. And, I might add, usually have higher turnout rates than the US."
danjt78,jarsnazzy,"The democrats are not the rebels, they are the empire. They are wholly owned and corrupted."
daoffoi,Human-Infinity,"And the Republicans aren't? You are delusional if you think the Republicans are any less corrupt. And they pander to special interest as much as anyone else, with devastating consequences like inaction on climate change.Besides, the Republicans will soon control the presidency, house, and senate, despite receiving less total votes in 2 of those 3. Not to mention that they will also control the supreme court. Comparing the Democrats to the empire when they won't have control over a single branch of government is honestly just silly. The Republicans will be the ones in power, while the Democrats will be the opposition that is ""rebelling"" against the group in power."
daoftjb,jarsnazzy,"The Republicans aren't the issue, we know where they stand and they make that clear. They are fuck heads. The problem is the democrats and their deceitful game of pretending to be the good cop while giving million dollar speeches to wall street. That's why the discussion is about abandoning them to start a new party. You aren't going to change them from within when their core is fundamentally corrupt."
damxr1l,LaWu,"Not true. A lot of center-right are dying to leave the big R, but forget about them joining the Dems, they need a new party."
damz9nt,Timmytanks40,Honestly this is way more true than we realize. Trumps picks for offices kinda fucked up any idea this was an insurgency. It looked loke a shake up but honestly when it all comes crashing down the voter will win.Honestly can we just get Cory Booker Mark Cuban to run? Between the two of them they're an actual super hero.
dan4i87,eximil,Edit: Replied to wrong comment
dan4kll,eximil,"Then I'd have the same answer for those people, just change Democrat to Republican and change the party from within the way our federal government works, you won't get very far by creating a new party."
danamoh,sustainably_extinct,">Splitting off into another party would be terrible for advancing a progressive agenda62 million people had nothing better to do on Nov 8 than to vote for Trump.64 +105 = 169 million registered voters DIDN'T vote for Trump. I think a NEW party could very easily take-off very quickly. The Tea Party pretty much sprang up in one election cycle, and they have shaken the Republicans to their roots.In USA's history, there have been several other parties that arose quite quickly.I still hoped that the Democrats could change in 2000. And in 2008. I even thought; MAYBE, Clinton would not be so bad in 2016. Not so much anymore. Even now, they're still so steeped in ""third-way"" rhetoric, that they're still blaming ""berniebros"" for Hillary's inability to scrape together enough EC votes to defeat a rapist."
danumj7,eximil,"Except the Tea Party isn't a separate party. It's a faction within the GOP. If you want a progressive faction within the Democratic party, then that's fine. That is essentially trying to change the party from within. To create an entire separate party like the green or libertarian parties would be a mistake though."
damw97l,Blehgopie,Where they say great things and do ok things. Republicans say shitty things and deliver whenever possible.

damu0z9,Reddisaurusrekts,DEA reports directly and only to the Executive.
damz0nl,Chakra5,So any power the president has should be acted on? Even if the opposition party has such strong objections?
damzk62,Reddisaurusrekts,"If the President was genuine about acting on them? Yes. There are reasons why some powers are reserved to the Executive, and others reserved to Congress.I'll note that hasn't stopped the President (Bush, not Obama) from going to war without Congressional approval anyway."
damzyix,Chakra5,"Yeah well, I certainly take your point there. But I'm not sure it's an argument FOR acting on every damn thing they want."
danh77k,ChuanFaFist,This is literally the power invested in him by his job. The law is written so that the AG can change the scheduling.
dany8td,Chakra5,Again with the can he and should he distinction.I get it. in your mind he SHOULD
dao7tzt,ChuanFaFist,"Yes, he should do t the right thing. If that's something you need to argue against, you have issues."
daobgqp,Chakra5,"I have issues because I have a different point of view on executive powers?If you have to resort to that sort of thing, you already failed the discussion friend."

dapumin,Chakra5,"'wrong thing' - I don't accept that premise, necessarily, although I also don't see it as cut-n-dried> You haven't made the caseNot my place to. You made the initial comments without making a case that it's the 'right thing'. Not on me to disprove a comment that is not yet proven."
daqt68q,ChuanFaFist,Freeing millions from being persecuted for the medicine they take is not the right thing? You're immoral if you believe that. I seriously question your stance on anything else if you are into that viewpoint.
darayz0,Chakra5,"In no way do I think marijuana should not be legal. It's absurd that it is not and that so many have had their lives ruined or have been blocked from living a better life because of some prohibition mind set based in misinformation, scare tactics, and fearful.I would completely support any action that ended said prohibition nation wide tomorrow, although I would have my concerns.What I DO think about _not_ making some move of that sort has already been offered in some small part, ...and ignored/dismissed on it's face by you. So I don't know that we're having a sane, two-way, nuanced conversation, as much as talking past each other, which is a waste of time really.On the positive side, I have learned a bit by talking to you, so I appreciate that much,...but it's not really a thread worth continuing at it's current level IMO.Have a nice evening, and here's to the repeal of all Marijuana prohibition soon!"
darrhf2,ChuanFaFist,"Concern trolling over this is ridiculous. It's allowed by law, it's the right thing to do, so there's no excuse except for some nebulous reasons you're holding onto."
das80vn,Chakra5,"That's just insulting, dismissive and obtuse.Let's be honest here. You really don't SEEM to have any interest in a discussion. In fact in reading your posts, you SEEM to just be taking positions against Blue team.No one but us is reading it and you don't seem inclined to do anything but repeat your position that speaks against [insert blue team politician] but I'll at least try the whole thing on. I get it, you think Obama/Blue-team sucks,... right and wrong, black and white,...and red and blue, but at least try it on for a change?There is enough contention on the subject between parties and amongst Americans that taking executive action on this matter may not be a wise move, especially at this point in winding down his term. Especially when he's taken executive action on other matters and that is being used by the red team to divide us further. So executive action, right or wrong though the actual action may be, _should_ be taken with caution. I'm not even saying that this action should or should not be taken mind you, just that having restraint itself is a quality, not a bug.Actually thinking a thing over, considering others beliefs, even ones you don't hold, and being cautious, is IMPORTANT.A president should not take all actions he/she is entitled to, even when the ends are just. He/She _should_ consider other factors. Executive action must be a very deliberate tool. And the powers give to a president, whatever they may be, should not be off-the-cuff.The tide is turning on Pot, but many in the heartland still view it as a dangerous drug. There are all kinds of sub-issues involved that lead to fear. Driving under the influence for one. Addiction for another. Note that the actual validity of those and other topics are not mine to question here. I think we can work all that out.I'm talking about other peoples perception. Cases can surely be made, but people are not really listening to facts.And meanwhile, the tide CONTINUES to turn on it's own. So perhaps, we should LET IT. It's a tough choice, and it's one that might actually be best left to it's own evolution. There IS wisdom in letting the matter work itself out over the next few elections and letting those people in the middle of the country come to it on their own terms. It would then be durable and will not further pollute an utterly toxic body politic.Meanwhile, he's done good work getting non-violent drug offenders out of jail!Now, he MAY reschedule it on his way out. There are actions yet to be taken and time will tell. I guess the bottom line is, it simply isn't as cut and dried as you make it. But then, really, anything he does is grounds for derision for you, is it not??"

Rolling it back would leave 10 million uninsured.)* Ban on altering rates according to current health status (in addition to barring coverage complete because of certain conditions)Of course, now the idea is to keep the popular parts and get rid of the unpopular parts which is hilarious because that's essentially wanting the milk for free. But that's not new for the Republican party."
daqt3xt,ChuanFaFist,I'm telling you that the Healthcare plan could have been two pages for the two issues most often mentioned: parents plan and pre existing conditions.
damuu7r,fec2245,Poor people are covered by the ~~medicare~~ medicaid expansion.
damv5p8,ggeialsdkfjaldf,"You're talking about Medicaid and you're wrong. The Supreme Court ruled that they couldn't force states to expand Medicaid.Lower Middle Class people still have a hard time paying for pills/procedures. Poor people still can't afford shit. Obamacare makes you feel good but it did a hell of a lot less than you think it did. If you're so poor that you qualify for free coverage, you can't afford the gas to get to all your check ups either way."
damx12s,fec2245,">You're talking about Medicaid Yeah, my bad.>you're wrong.Not really, the majority of Americans live in states that are covered by the Medicaid expansion and the ones that aren't can't really be blamed on Obama as much as on the states governors who mostly refused to participate for partisan reasons.> If you're so poor that you qualify for free coverage, you can't afford the gas to get to all your check ups either way.138% of the Federal poverty line isn't nothing. It's ~ $16.5k for an individual which is a full time job at about $8/hr. It's by no means a comfortable income but not as dire as you make it seem."
damumsy,DrVanBuren,"The ACA (Obamacare) individual mandate was originally the brain child of the American Heritage Foundation think-tank. What we needed was single payer healthcare. What we got was a Republican healthcare plan with an individual mandate.It was better than what we had, yes, but Obama and the Democrats should have fought for what we all desperately needed. Healthcare for all.http://americablog.com/2013/10/original-1989-document-heritage-foundation-created-obamacares-individual-mandate.html"
damveyw,gerdataro,"I know all about it. I helped organize and publicize one of the biggest protests for healthcare reform that year. What you're saying is much easier said than done, especially considering the supermajority was sort of bunk (see my other reply). I'm not sure how old you are, but you have to think back to ""Harry and Louise,"" (it's a throwback) and the fact there was a recession. What you're proposing wasn't ever going to happen. It was meant to be incremental. To move us in the right direction."
damwbgl,DrVanBuren,"> What you're proposing wasn't ever going to happen.I think this is the kind of thinking that causes us to never get real meaningful change. When you come to the negotiating table you can't already be willing to concede your position in favor of the opposition. This is why Republican's keep winning. Despite their lunacy, they fight tough and rarely ever back down.It's a much longer conversation to go and relive that fight. But I think Obama could have whipped those votes and got single payer healthcare through. But that's not our President. In the end, he couldn't even get all the democrats behind him for single payer and had to do the individual mandate."
damuwo6,fec2245,We got what we could get. The ACA hardly passed and the public option had to be removed to get Lieberman on board.
damtyam,Malowski_,Also the stimulus bill which saved the economy.Trivial things like that.
dams2sq,,[deleted]
damtpun,Malowski_,"> That's true but you can still do other things.They did, they passed a stimulus bill which a number of studies found to have stopped a 2nd great depression."
damv968,gerdataro,"Well, to be honest, the whole thing about him having a supermajority is sort of bunk. The Republicans blocked Al Franken and by the time he joined Senator Byrd was ill, and then Kennedy died and Scott Brown took the seat. They had that blank check for a few sweet months when Kennedy's interim Democratic replacement was in D.C. and it was during this time that they passed ACA. Also, I think people underestimate how much work went into this healthcare law. It was a massive undertaking that required all of Obama's political cache."
damvt56,SG8970,"Jesus Christ, it fucking sucks how this myth is still going strong.http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/fleeting-illusory-supermajority"
damxjjj,stefantalpalaru,"He either had the majority to pass Obamacare with no Republican support, or he didn't. You can't have it both ways."
damyplw,Deto,"What if he had the majority for Obamacare, but didn't have a majority for other things? It's not like he can just command all the Democratic Senators to vote one way. I'm sure it took work to even get everyone on board for Obama care."
dan0mxk,stefantalpalaru,In this case we would need to blame the Democratic party for not supporting Obama properly for the 2 years it should have. Anyone up for that?
danh8np,ChuanFaFist,"He's the leader of the party. If he can't rally them, it means he's an awful leader."
danze1l,Deto,"He did rally them - for Obamacare. I'm sure it took work too.He didn't simultaneously rally them to *carte blanche* impose his will. But if you're treating anything short of that as being an ""awful leader"" then I think you're being a little ridiculous."
dao7sj2,ChuanFaFist,Obama care was extremely contentious. Remember the blue dogs?
dao8w0g,Deto,"Yeah, definitely. So what's your point again?"
dao97zj,ChuanFaFist,"He could barely rally his own party on Healthcare. He failed to rally them on anything else.He was no lyndon Johnson. Obama was a pretty typical crap manager: talks a good game, can't deliver"
daoevfn,Deto,Ok sure. I'm sure we would have seen things other than Obamacare had the Republicans not gained control of the house and stonewalled every single initiative he proposed thereafter.
dapqqyu,ChuanFaFist,"Yeah that's really a shame that he managed to lead his entire party into the wilderness while declaring that the Republicans were done with. He really tried, you know?"
damrmwu,BridgeOfATelecaster,Executive order would be reversed by Next president. It's dumb and not the right way to do it.
damu0j3,Reddisaurusrekts,It would've entrenched legal marijuana for 8 years. It would be a MUCH harder task to reverse that than to keep the status quo going.
damsgx0,ManyPoo,"It would make Trump look bad to a lot of his bad - not dumb or stupid. He also could have done it years ago. Face it, he just doesn't want to. It's not ""can't"" it's ""won't"""
damsn0p,BridgeOfATelecaster,Are you really saying that Trump can do something that will affect him negatively? Jesus. Do you even watch his campaign? He'd probably say something about how it leads to crimes and blah blah blah. He could shit in the mouth of his supporters and they'd be fine with it.
dao11hk,ManyPoo,"Why don't we all just roll over now then? The fact he got more popular from the attacks is more an indictment on the nature of media attacks on him which focused on pussy grabbing and political incorrectness (things his supporters love) rather than his failed businesses. You assuming his supporters will never leave regardless of what he does is just as misguided. His base has trusted him this far, but if he goes against his promises to them, they will react."
dao737j,BridgeOfATelecaster,He already broke his top 5 promises. And they haven't left. Regardless. He will not be the new normal. I'm am willing to die for my country if need be.
dao898s,ManyPoo,"He isn't even in power yet. His supporters still think he's going to build the wall, bring back the jobs, lower their taxes, etc. They still trust him. It'll be a very different situation 2 years into his presidency when they see if he did all that or not. Believing they'll follow him to the ends of the earth is as misguided as the media thinking they'll leave him after a few politically incorrect statements.And there is no cost to Obama forcing him to break another promise, there's only a potential upside. By you accept your logic, we shouldn't even bother criticising Trump, no-one will be swayed, his supporters will never leave him."
daoeqme,BridgeOfATelecaster,The number of contradictions in your statement is alarming.
daoitco,ManyPoo,Which one is the most contradictory?
damvph9,e-guy,"True, but Trump is pro-marijuana.He has said that he thinks medical should be legal everywhere and recreational should be left up to the states--which is actually a more progressive stance of the issue than Obama's.If Obama created an executive order to reschedule, Trump would likely fully support it and not repeal, given that an executive order to that effect is what Trump has promised already.So no. Don't try to make excuses. Obama fucked up on this, and he almost certainly knows it, as evidenced by this non-apology apology."
dan13k0,BridgeOfATelecaster,He also was a lot of things. He's reversed about half of them already. Executive order is the most bullshit dumb ass approach to legalization of marijuana period.
dan1h65,e-guy,"I agree it's the worst way to go about it, but you claimed that Trump would repeal any executive order in favor of legalization, when reality does not support that. Trump may be manipulated into repealing any executive order, but left to his own devices, there is no reason to think he would repeal it of his own volition; if anything, he seems likely to support it on a personal level. What seems likely to happen is Trump makes an executive order for it in a vague way, his attorney general stands against it, and nothing happens one way or the other."
dan5f9l,BridgeOfATelecaster,He was gonna drain the swamp. He was gonna go after Hillary. He was gonna ban muslims. He was gonna build the wall. He was gonna get rid of Obamacare. He's gonna legalize pot?Gimme a break. Y'all been hustled like the chumps you are.
dan7icb,e-guy,"I'm not even pro-Trump. I voted for Clinton, and I think Trump is a huge goofball who somehow bumbled his way into the White House.But there's so much untruth on this sub about how Trump is literally mechanized devil-Hitler that I find I spend more time arguing with people saying shit like that than with the few pro-Trump people, who are usually wrong, but already have been corrected. Meanwhile, blatant lies and propaganda circulate here constantly, and no one says anything because it's anti-Trump.In this case, Trump's position on this issue is clear. He may very well not follow up on it, but ""may not"" is not the same as ""will not"", and I personally feel like he should at least be given the chance to succeed or fail by his own merits. If he fails, I will be one of the first to laugh at his fat ass.But at least let him have the chance to fuck up before you attack him for fucking up, goddamn!"
danm64x,BridgeOfATelecaster,"He's already fucked up! Have you seen his cabinet! He's already made those statements. I haven't criticized him for one hung he haven't already done ""goddamn!""The issue isn't clear. Tell me where I said anything hat isn't true. Go for it. Propaganda? My sources are Trump himself. I don't care who you voted for. You're a chump."
damt9o5,hk1111,Small government GOP just love the idea of forcing their moral code on others. Gop is anti-legalization so basically would never get a bill passed through the house.
damuhj8,Reddisaurusrekts,The DEA is under the aegis of the Executive. Congress didn't need to do anything. That's the entire point - Obama could've done this himself all along.
damv03m,hk1111,"Legislation enacts the laws, executive enforces them, he was already ignoring the law by not enforcing the law in states that legalized it, but to change the law, legislation needed to act. No matter what obama did, it would still be illegal due to the law being in place. Do not pretend that the GOP is not to blame for this, they could have passed a bill legalizing it in the last 4 years and force Obama to sign it or veto, which likely he would have signed it. But they do not because they want to force their beliefs on everyone else, they hate personal liberty. Now we have a full republican gov, which will probably enforce the law via DEA in the states that obama has to this point been ignoring."
damval7,Reddisaurusrekts,The GOP haven't pretended they want to legalise marijuana though.
damvue1,hk1111,"Yes, so rather than blaming the person who was quiet with their support then moderate support for said action(legalization of weed), maybe blame the party that has been actively keeping it illegal?"
damxai8,Reddisaurusrekts,No I'm calling out hypocrisy and pretending to care.
damyz1c,Chakra5,It's really not coming across as that though. It's really kinda coming out unbalanced (based on the very point above you here)
damyweo,Chakra5,And I would say that he actually should NOT have (and did not) act unilaterally on this. Too many other points of contention. It's very easy to say the man had the power to do x and thus SHOULD have done x. Our presidents should not be doing everything they have the power to do. There is a reason we don't have monarchs.
damzmoj,Reddisaurusrekts,"I wouldn't care other than the fact that he's now ***saying*** he wants to do it.Our President should do everything they have power to do. It's up to Congress and the Courts to check that power if warranted. That's what the separation of powers is. If the President exercising his Constitutional and legal powers would lead to abuses, then we've already fucked up."
dan00c2,Chakra5,Well we're talking opinion and you're certainly due your own.I like that our prez had some restraint.
damtxrw,Not_a_Clue,Like Flint?
damugjm,Reddisaurusrekts,"Like a lot of things. Though personally my biggest issue is with the part where he said ""I do solemnly swear that I... will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.""And then ripped it up and used it for confetti."
damuwjb,,This is what democrats do...
damyr5x,Chakra5,"this always amazes me. I think considering the obstacles, the man got a lot of stuff done, including the whole economy meltdown thing.i think sometimes you need to step back from the front page drama and actually look at the actual work.* http://pleasecutthecrap.com/obama-accomplishments/* http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/marchapril-2012/obamas-top-50-accomplishments/"
dan6ww1,TSHIRTTIIIIIIME,Welcome to the Republican party
danair9,sustainably_extinct,"yeah, this is EXACTLY how I felt about Al Gore."
danewv1,diamonddog421,"In this case with an very rightwing cabinet and whatnot coming forward, I would think its strategically better to not try and make a huge step right now. There would be a large vocal outlash from conservative voices and people. I think it's smarter to defend gains in marijuana legalization while it's fairly solidified than to push for something and potentially lose years of progress."
danfdpg,Reddisaurusrekts,Right now? Perhaps. 8 years ago with a Dem majority in Congress though...?
dams45c,deathcab4booty,Psst... that's not Obama's fault.
damsm2v,Reddisaurusrekts,"When it's something over which he has complete control like the DEA, yeah it is."
damsj6p,,You don't have any idea how it works. If he gives the order to decriminalize what's stopping trump from recrimination of it?He needs a more solid thing which isn't gonna happen when 50% of the Senate are Republicans
damtzsm,Reddisaurusrekts,> If he gives the order to decriminalize what's stopping trump from recrimination of it?If he'd done it 8 years ago? The next 8 years of Obama's presidency.
dammr9w,,All talk no action.
damvkse,,"Sounds a lot like Donald. His tax returns? The birther ""evidence""?"
damvmeo,mearry,"Something, something, say anything, change nothing."
damhwd5,blissplus,What schedule are alcohol and tobacco? He needs to DE-schedule it.
dami0zw,FireNexus,"Alcohol and tobacco are explicitly exempted from being scheduled. By law, he can reschedule but not deschedule. The US is Party to multiple treaties which require that we keep it as a controlled substance. Descheduling would be transparently illegal and thus fail any possible court challenge.The CSA specifically states that the AG must schedule or deschedule in accordance with treaties to which the US is a party."
damqsxz,blissplus,"Yes, the US *never* breaks treaties or risks court challenges. Everything by the book for us!"
damqzvz,FireNexus,"The US breaking a treaty would result in a court challenge from within the government. Likely one that the incoming AG has no interest in defending, and which absolutely no federal judge is going to decide in Obama's favor on.Don't be dense. The treaty and associated court challenge make doing it useless and potentially counterproductive without legislative support."
damxve5,LaWu,"The US is breaking a treaty *right now*, what do you mean they don't care to defend? They don't defend it because they don't even hear it."
danwq8n,FireNexus,"The court challenge. You think Sessions is going to bother trying to defend an overtly illegal action that he's ideologically opposed to? The courts will strike down the change, and it will be meaningless."
danzdwl,LaWu,"It's not right, but you're probably right lol."
damscbh,blissplus,"Yes. I'm *so* dense. Everyone says so.Oh my goodness, not a court challenge! Yeah, the US got in all kinds of trouble for torturing people and repeatedly violating international treaties. We sure can't do *that* anymore."
damtgq9,,"I'm not sure how to process someone who's simultaneously upset when the US shirks its international responsibilities *and* upset when the US *won't* shirk its international responsibilities. It seems to me that you should be arguing either for the US to meet all of its treaty obligations, or none of them, rather than just the ones that are convenient for a position that you hold."
damtt36,blissplus,"When I made my random offhand smart-ass comment my very first concern was how you would process it all. Because obviously I'm here to argue a position!God lord, people. OCD much?"
damu7cx,,"In the future, if you want to avoid discussion, you might want to refrain from common methods of starting one. Such as going to a discussion space and stating your opinion on the debate at hand. At the very least it'll save you the marginal effort you put into your sarcastic little quips.I'm not sure you understand what OCD is either but that's a whole other can of worms."
damwwzo,blissplus,"Thanks, dad. Will do. Pleasing pedants is what I live for."
damug64,FireNexus,"If they aren't saying it to your face, I can guarantee they're saying it behind your back."
damwo21,blissplus,Just imagine what they say behind *your* back.
dan0eam,FireNexus,I only keep people in my life who will call me an asshole to my face.
danb74t,blissplus,"I'd be happy to, but that's a bannable offense here, kind sir."
damlspq,TheRedGerund,Well damn. There's no legal federal path to legislation without breaking international treaties?
damnqy2,FireNexus,"Correct. Treaties that were pretty much all our doing, enforcing a host of related policies that we really don't have the political will to be on the wrong side of, and which a number of countries would love to be out from under. So we can't legalize with the existing treaties, and we can't exit the treaties because of the possible collapse of the international narcotic control framework. Non-medical legalization will require new treaties, and our bargaining position is going to be a pretty bad one."
damw1pp,GoAheadAndH8Me,"Deschedule and make it the same thing as any other plant instead of the same thing as tobacco. Basil doesn't need a law exempting it from the schedule.As for the treaties, exit em. It'd be great to rid the world of narcotics control while we're at it."
damrekj,MiaowaraShiro,"Well, they could re-write the CSA a bit. Laws are fairly easy for congress to change."
damryf7,classicalmusicfan,"Yeah. Bill Clinton said the same thing after leaving office. If only they had been in a position of power, to you know, make actual change. Oh well."
damvyr4,HitlerSaurusChrist,Couldn't he have done this at any point in the last 8 years? Why now?
dampcfk,jimmmyftw,Came here to say this. Why wait until you have a month left in office?! Either he's scared to deal with it or he was planning this all along as one of his final movements.
damr36m,Ex_Why_,It means nothing if he does it now. It can be undone within months of trumps... Reign of terror.
dams51b,teflon_honey_badger,"Ya, it seems like a bitch move on Obama's part to wait until he's on his way out to drop this."
damtnbb,MattAU05,"Agreed. If the President believes this and has done nothing during his term to address it, it is even worse than not believing it at all. He's more morally culpable than those who believe that marijuana is dangerous. Because he's seeing great injustices being done, he has the power to do something (the DEA is part of his executive branch) and he's failing to act.He's failing to act knowing it is wrong to fail to act. And knowing he AG's office is about to be run by an avowed anti-marijuana guy like Sessions.It is a damn disgrace that he can say this and then do nothing. He's had almost eight years and the most he can do is lip service to the issue in an interview with a magazine manager? What he actual fuck?"
damq2e7,AllTrumpDoesIsWin,"He's a shit-talker and time-waster, he ain't gwine do shit."
damuakr,someguyyoutrust,"It fucking blows my mind that we are still having this conversation as a country, if you think weed should be illegal at this point in time you're a god damn moron."
damuno3,mcdstod,He can't
damuym1,,He was president for 8 years. He admitted to smoking pot before he was elected. He had his fucking chance to make a change if it was something he really cared about.
damw1hc,tjmax,Ha! DEA might want to have a word about that first
damxh27,Gobbythefatcat,"Didn't you read the article? In the Rolling Stone interview published this week, Obama also reiterated his long-standing position that changing federal marijuana laws is not something the president can do unilaterally. “Typically how these classifications are changed are not done by presidential edict,” he said, “but are done either legislatively or through the DEA. As you might imagine, the DEA, whose job it is historically to enforce drug laws, is not always going to be on the cutting edge about these issues.”"
damxiah,franky_emm,"Yeah, where the fuck has he been on this for nearly eight years?"
damy8ys,FilmsByDan,Agreed. Tired of the inaction.
dan0fdg,ImAWizardYo,"He risks polarizing the debate. If that happens the idiots will side with whatever daddy GOP tells them to do. Change has to come from the people, and they are bringing it."
dan4or8,SandersTheJedi,But emails.
dcaxl5t,Gunn_Anon,Hes such a true progressive :3
damnzgz,cp5184,That's what hillary clinton promised.
damr2dq,Dorion_FFXI,I came to post this.Talk is cheap.He's had 8 years to actually do something about it.
damrao0,,That's the nature of being president I guess. You will have to sacrifice some battles and you'll probably beat yourself up and have others do the same rather than look at the context of the Presidency and all the political realities that come with it.
damrnea,pizza___,"I would argue that it wasn't a big topic 8 years ago as it is now. And he was dealing with a crippled economy. And it's at the end of his term, so he can he can pretty much say whatever he wants."
damq3en,MrIosity,"And give up the opportunity to nail the Republicans with a wedge issue they have majority support with the public on?I think Obama is positioning the party for a platform that they can campaign on, and realistically deliver when they take office. He's in a lame duck session. The timing of this statement signals more about what he'll be working on with the DNC after January than anything else."
damrk5d,pilgrimboy,This issue along with Standing Rock just emphasizes to me that Obama is not a leader.
dams663,TheRealCJ,"Sure, that'll work. Well, actually, I mean... He *did* manage to skew the Supreme Court in favour of liberal policies thanks to *oh fucking wait*.What the *hell* makes you think that he would be able to get *anywhere* with this if they won't even acknowledge his right to select a SCOTUS nominee, in gross violation of the constitution?"
damtuk9,MattAU05,"The DEA is part of the executive branch. It unilaterally schedules drugs. The President is the boss of the entire executive branch. Get it?Aside from that, if he was looking at legislation, he would have complete support on the left, and support from Constitutional conservatives like Rand Paul on the right."
damrl04,BridgeOfATelecaster,Jesus fucking christ. Then the next president can just reverse it. How can you people on Reddit still not see this? Trump is literally planning to do this across the board already. How many goddamn times do we have to go over this?
dams5i5,FireNexus,"The next President has to pay the political price to reverse it. A president who is on record as not really caring about marijuana and supported by a group that disproportionately supports full legalization, let alone the medical purpose use that rescheduling without legislation would be able to allow."
damseef,BridgeOfATelecaster,Oh yeah I forgot Trump is the kind of person to walk on egg shells. /s Fuck that. He could piss on his supporters and they'd happily lap it up. It doesn't matter politically what Trump does. His campaign has proven that over and over.
damtqk1,MattAU05,So he shouldn't try? Stop being an apologist. That makes you part of the problem. He can act. He can set an example and a precedent. And he hasn't.
dan18dd,BridgeOfATelecaster,"No. because if it goes to court or the senate they can permanently make it illegal or anything similar. It's taking bait to use an executive order. Same thing with gay marriage. The repercussions could be horrific. Not to mention that just because 60% of Americans support it, doesn't mean that 60% actually votes."
damh6r6,vanceco,"then please do so, actions speak louder than words.for starters- your administration could declassify it from being a schedule 1 ""narcotic""...like, today."

dan0cjb,ImAWizardYo,He has to review each one and there is a legal process for each. This is in addition every other thing he does. Obama has done more than any other president before him. We can't even get Trump to read his intelligence briefings. Sweeping changes have to come from the people and the people are bringing it on this front. If Obama does too much right now it will polarize the debate and the idiots will change their minds once daddy GOP tells them weed is bad.
danha0g,ChuanFaFist,">He has to review each one and there is a legal process for each. In the constitution there's no process. He could make it happen, he just didn't want to do it."
dan1rj1,e-guy,"Alternatively, he could use his executive privilege to order law enforcement to ignore to reduce punishment for low-level, nonviolent, personal use drug cases, while simultaneously creating an executive action to expedite the process of getting people with nonviolent drug charges against them out of the system faster.Or he could personally pardon 1% of them, say some pretty words, then go back to throwing young minority kids in jail, laughing all the way.Ha. Ha. Ha."
dan3bly,Sebatinsky,">he could use his executive privilege to order law enforcement to ignore to reduce punishment for low-level, nonviolent, personal use drug casesYou understand that federal law enforcement has done effectively zero enforcement of marijuana laws, right? And you understand that he has no authority over local police departments who are doing all the arresting for possession, right?"
dan8iaz,BannedGamer,In San Diego it was the DEA and ATF kicking down dispensary doors.
damxlzg,18093029422466690581,"Holy shit man, Obama has done a hell of a lot more commuting of sentences than any other president has, yet you still shit on him. He reviews these crimes on a case by case basis. You really think Obama wants to empty the prisons in large swaths and find out 20% of them go commit more serious crimes?"
damxua4,XboxUncut,"This is complete bullshit.If he truly feels the way he says about marijuana than yes he should commute everyone in jail for possession of weed, including those that grew and distributed it.It's innocent until proven guilty, keeping people locked in jail because ""they may commit worse crimes"" if you let them out is just... dumb."
dan0z4y,issue9mm,"So, 1) The president can only pardon federal crimes. If a meth distributor was found guilty of distributing meth as a state crime and a federal crime of trafficking, Obama can only pardon the trafficking2) If the meth distributor is pardoned of trafficking, he's still guilty of distribution, and he's still in jail for the crimes against whatever state he was arrested in. 3) Just a guess, and I'd love to be proven wrong, but I don't think there are that many people found guilty of federal crimes for possession of weed. Distribution is probably another thing, but that probably explains why the current list of commutations seems to have so many meth / crack / cocaine distributors on it, because they're more likely to be taken up federally than pot. Edit: formatting"

danjcoy,XboxUncut,I'm a libertarian.
dan0tpd,issue9mm,"Interesting. I looked at the list of commutations, and the first few names on the list were... more serious offenses than possession of marijuana. * Lawrence Daro Adams - Possession with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine* Tyrone Allen - [Possession with intent to distribute more than 5 kilos of cocaine, cocaine trafficking](http://patch.com/maryland/belair/bel-air-man-indicted-alleged-drug-ring-involvement)* Lisa Woods Ball - Conspiracy to distribute more than 500 grams of methamphetamine* Curtis Beasley - Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five grams or more but less than 50 grams of crack cocaine; possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of crack cocaine* Anthony Arthur - Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least 50 grams of ""crack cocaine""That's just the five most recent commutations that were vetted case by case. https://www.justice.gov/pardon/obama-commutations"

Hope you like struggling to get a minimum wage literally until the day you die, don't like voting (cause you can't in many states), don't like housing (again, legal to discriminate against felons) and don't like government aid because you are disqualified from most of it.So, he lets some drug offenders spend less time and prison so that they can get out there and go live cripplingly impoverished lives due their inability to get decent jobs and most forms of aid. I suppose we will all act surprised when they wind up in prison doing the only work they are allowed to do; crime. It's nice he commuted those sentences, but it was just pissing in into the wind. America, the land of the free, will continue to hold 25% of the world's caged humans, have more prisoners both per capita and in raw numbers, and even worse have tens of millions of people essentially stripped of their citizenship for life by the felony mark that most other civilized nations consider to be an abomination. Who the fuck prevents former prisoners from trying to reform by doing damn near everything to keep them from getting a fucking job and reforming?

damrqsp,Somewhatcubed,"The frustrating thing is Trump was *always* a possibility. We knew *any* of Obama's successors could put and end to the whole thing which is why we were begging for something to be done in the first place.

damt2c2,grayarea69,"Well Obama is a neoliberal who campaigned on ""change"" and being the first black president...Well shit changed. We have a shit ton of echo chambers that act as news sources and black unemployment continues to stay at a hefty percentage of the black population in America. To think Obama is a 'good' president really depends on where your investments were at the time. Objectively, the average American has suffered because of him...and his following of his CitiBank staffers advice..whom were responsible for the 08 collapse in the first place. Yes Bush, started the wars that helped lead to the collapse...and at this point if you haven't noticed the collusion between political parties since Reagan in order to enact imperialism than you are too many steps away from the current political environment."

And the sad thing is, he knows all this.The sad thing is, no, an executive order can overwrite a law by Congress and no the President can't just tell the heads of the FDA/DEA to change scheduling. The FDA requires mass clinical trials and scientific evidence to make recommendations to the DEA on the safety of drugs. These clinical trials have not even been attempted yet. How does no one here understand the basics of American government?"
danhj30,Ganjake,"He wouldn't be overwriting the Controlled Substances Act, he would be using his authority over those two agencies to mold them into a fair mechanism for research. He can absolutely 100% restructure the process specifically for cannabis while still adhering to clinical trial and safety requirements. The whole point of this is the government can't reschedule until there's research right? Well 1) there already is. Been plenty of government research on cannabis since [Nixon.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafer_Commission) 2) He could make it so that they can properly research it at universities and firms without making it available for prescription or consumption. He already ""expanded"" the number of places that can receive permits to do research, so all he needs to do is just make it available for everyone to research, then we get our rescheduling in the very near future. So yes he can because he already has to a much lesser than required extent."
danto47,exodus7871,No. There has never been a mass clinical trial for marijuana. Smaller clinical trials so far have not found evidence of medical application of marijuana. The DEA approved the [first trial](http://fortune.com/2016/04/22/dea-medical-marijuana/) that qualifies for the FDA this year. The last review of marijuana took 5 years. Clinical trials for the FDA can take even longer than that. You want an executive order removing the requirement for the FDA to use scientific evidence as a basis of approving or denying substances? That's not a good idea. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Removal_of_cannabis_from_Schedule_I_of_the_Controlled_Substances_Act) is an article on rescheduling drugs.

Or is he nominating them because they're rich and share his ideals?I mean, he's nominating them to cater to the group that won him the election. It's pretty straightforward, and is what every politician does. >They were certainly a big part, but the demographic that really won him the election was white working class men and women in the northeast.1) Trump didn't actually win a single state in New England. So, not really the northeast. 2) It wasn't working class people, actually. The #1 indicator of the likelihood someone would support trump was low levels education, regardless of class standing. The #2 indicator was whether or not the voter considered themselves an evangelical christian. He pulled [just over 80%](http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2016/november/trump-elected-president-thanks-to-4-in-5-white-evangelicals.html) of Christians in swing states like Ohio. Without these voters, he would not have won the swing states that he did, and would've lost the election. Pennsylvania's evangelical voters are what pushed trump over the edge."
dan1bp7,Lyndell,"Well it depends who gave him money, since it was the prisons it doesn't matter what real money it will bring in. Trump's campaign was lined with money to make sure the prisons would be stocked with fresh new meat."
damuksw,wh3873,You forget racism. Ask yourself this question. Will the GOP position hurt people of color disproportionately or help them even a little? If it's the former it's a party plank. If it's the later it's communism.
danscfc,RsMasterChief,Just because things effect blacks more doesn't mean racism is involved. Substandard reading comprehension and mathematics skills also effect 'poc'(except asians) but that's not because books and numbers are racist

dan0ra8,citizenkane86,Not to trumps friends though.
dan4h9x,Bishizel,Which is why it's going to be a huge legal battle. The states aren't just going to sit there and let that revenue stream dry up.
danaxg4,sustainably_extinct,"That's the point. That money goes to the state.Whereas; with a War On Drugs, that money goes to the shareholders.Also, people who end up in the prison system for a stem, have their lives ruined, so they can't ever vote Democrat, or run for office, or ever be anything other than a drag on society, and they usually become lifetime customers of the private prison system."
danest3,Iamaleafinthewind,"The established businesses have the lobbying money. When you consider big pharma also has its own reasons for maintaining the status quo, the balance of lobbying dollars is likely not favoring decriminalization.That's my guess, at any rate."

damq1zf,oversizedhat,Well Jeff Sessions has something contrary to say on the matter.
damrdxe,pepedelafrogg,"It depends. If Trump stands up and says it in public, no way. The AG will not directly contradict the President. That never, ever happens.If Trump rolls over on it and was just using it to appeal to disaffected prior Obama voters, and that is entirely plausible, it's gone by February."

damse8r,Ladnil,The president elect also has no governing experience and will very likely be reliant on the advice and guidance of his cabinet and advisers. So Jeff Sessions will have a lot of influence.
damug7x,DetroitDiggler,"If Trump ever listened to anybody that is an advisor to him he would never have made it as far as he did.I am sure his advisors were like ""Please stay off of Twitter, you probably shouldn't call your opponent a 'nasty woman' and please stick to the script""Trump probably said verbatim after some thought and reflection ""You're Fired""."
damur3g,Ladnil,"Yeah, good point. His total lack of self control is probably going to serve him well in the oval."

damnj1n,Airway,"However you feel about Hillary, those stocks dropped a lot when she came out against private prisons too."
damnp63,Augustus_Caesar1,They dropped because of actions Congress took. Not because some politician spoke out against them.
damo4ki,Airway,She was widely expected to win the election at the time she said that. Not just some politician.
damo6r0,Augustus_Caesar1,It dropped a month before she said anything. She was trying to capitalize on something that she had no part in. People are still jerking off Hillary here huh? Denial can cause some strange behaviors. She literally had nothing to do with it. Get over yourselves.
damokda,Airway,"It dropped further, but I guess you can look at this like pandering if you want. Kind of like pretending to be pro LGBT and open to weed, then filling your cabinet with the biggest homophobes and drug war enthusiasts."
dams0ba,WasabiBomb,"This was Hillary's biggest problem, in my opinion. Every time she announced a policy decision which *should* have made liberals happy, a lot of the die-hard left just insisted she'd done it to ""pander"".It became clear very quickly that they were *looking* for reasons to hate her."

If you have a decent chunk of money that you can set aside and not use for the conceivable future, you pick an investment firm - do some research and pick one that's seems reliable and trustworthy, one that you can contact easily and has a good reputation - and ask them to do what they can. They'll put it into mutual funds, most likely - a lot of small stakes in different companies, some of which will do well and some of which won't because they can't see the future, but on average they'll probably do pretty decently."

dampb1r,animalcub,"Yes, of course."
dampca9,,They've been telling me for months that he's not like a regular republican. But all of his policies are exactly what the Republican Party believes on steroids.

dampmun,HashbeanSC2,"Much more lilely that Trump will be pro weed as he is stated he is, than it is that crooked Hillary would have been considering she said she is agsinst marijuana in every single aspect."
damr5tt,midwesternexposure,"I am not sure what he WILL do, but as a business man at his core, I can imagine seeing how much money Colorado made would be enough to make him double take and at least think, maybe we can make some $$s here... maybe that's a little glass half full of me."

damz23x,govt_policy,"You are absolutely correct! All he has done since he decided to run is talk about throwing people in jail. He has no comprehension of life or Liberty.

dan82f1,lawrnk,"Right, because when it comes to bypassing congress, he's been stellar! I mean, are you saying Obama can't?"
dan8cqt,MissDiketon,Are you talking about the same congress that overturned Obama's veto then blamed him for not stating the unintended consequences of that bill? (It was the bill to allow 9/11 families to sue Saudi Arabia) Or maybe you're talking about the congress that refuses to confirm Obama's SC nominee?

That's my mantra, my light at the start of the tunnel, for the next four years. We need to remember that Democrats won a majority of votes for the President, and a majority of votes for the Senate, while running on the *most progressive party platform in American history.* Americans voted for progress, but our system elected regress. Edit: I'd like to thank all the Trump supporters who keep reminding me, and themselves, that the popular vote doesn't matter, the Sanders supporters who insist that the most progressive major party platform in American history really wasn't that progressive at all, and the folks who keep complaining that both sides are the same and Hillary Clinton is just as bad as Donald Trump, also emails."

We didn't see how anyone could be stupid enough to think he was qualified for the job. >We didn't underestimate Trump we overestimated American's collective intelligence. QFT. I can't find it now, but there was an article that came out in the days after the election with a title along the lines of ""We didn't think less of you, we expected *better* of you."" You've summed up exactly how I've felt since election night. I'll admit my apparent naivete and say that I was expecting Secretary Clinton to win in a landslide; after the debates, the controversies, the sexual abuse allegations *and quotes,* I couldn't imagine anyone except Donald Trump's absolute die hard supporters voting for him. Boy was I wrong. To be honest, I'm still dumbfounded. Half of America voted for a known, documented conman, on the assumption that either ""He'll be a conman for *us* if we put him in the White House."" or that the entire media has been misleading them about him for the past thirty years.

dammoh9,captainslowww,"...aka the only portion that matters for the purposes of this discussion. I'm not happy about Trump, but I don't give a flying fuck about the opinions of people who didn't even bother to show up."
damocwa,trevskeetz,"And yet, that's an issue, as well: we immediately demonize any person for not voting, without knowing why they didn't. Thus far, that's about as far into the conversation as it gets. But, consider this: some went to the polls this past election and voted for the state-issues, but not for any of the given Presidential candidates. Why? Ask them"
dampi9m,captainslowww,"No. Those people chose to voice their opinions on the state and local issues, and that's wonderful, and I applaud them for doing their civic duty. If someone chose not to vote for President, that's also their right, and they may have had very good reasons for it, but their opinion on the subject is completely irrelevant."
dams0ws,Isric,"That kind of thinking marginalizes like half of your country to irrelevance though. That kind of discourse isn't healthy. When Trump starts deregulating everything and neglecting the environment it's not gonna matter who voted or not, we'll need all hands on deck."
damshtq,captainslowww,"American political discourse is, like, a billion different types of unhealthy. And the negative impacts of a Trump Presidency will be felt by everyone, voter or not. No argument there. But that's precisely *why* I'm so irritated with non-voters who now think their opinions should be taken seriously, despite not speaking up when they still could have prevented it. A vote is not a gift that you bestow on the candidate who you feel ""deserves it"" like a cookie for a well-behaved child-- It's your input on an enormously consequential choice that will be happening regardless of whether or not you participate, and choosing not to vote (in whatever election) is the same as saying you're fine with any outcome."
damuzgc,Isric,"Personally,Trump is an unqualified moron.Hillary was under federal investigation for treason. Libertarianism doesn't work, so Johnson isn't an option.Jill Stein is still way too Liberal for me.If you don't respect any of the candidates and don't think that any of them deserve the presidency, and everyone else has withdrawn, what else do you have left to do?"
damxo3d,eximil,"For the record, she was not under investigation for treason. The worst punishment she could ever have gotten was a slap on the wrist (probation) and fine. Treason is punishable by death."

damvdkk,trevskeetz,"To flip your own statement: if our elections are going to be decided regardless of whether or not an individual participates, what is the point in participating? To some, a great portion of individual voters are quite inconsequential in our Presidential election process, recognizing an aging system favors a territorial-voice over a populous-voice. And, to some, participating in such a system surrenders one's voice in the dissatisfaction to that system, and that's unacceptable.But hey, they didn't vote, so they don't deserve a voice. Filter out, right?"
damvy7f,manbrasucks,"Captainslowww attitude and the attitude of Hillary Supports have always been ""us vs them"".If you're not ""us"" you're demon racist moronic trump supporter. Don't bother."
damsuod,MutantOctopus,"I mean, you can't ask for someone to vote for someone they hate just because they hate someone else more. Maybe they felt that no option was good enough (Democrat nominee is corrupt, Republican nominee is a bigot, no other candidate would stand a chance) and I feel that that gives them as much right to be unhappy with the results than anyone else. You might argue that they should've voted third party, but considering the consistently low voting percentages for third party candidates across the country, a vote for them is effectively symbolic for the same thing.It's different, though, if someone just decided ""I don't feel like voting, I know we'll elect Clinton"" and are now getting mad about Trump. You're right in that case - if someone didn't vote because they didn't care enough to, I don't think their opinion about the election is as relevant as somebody who was active in attempting to elect a candidate they believed in. But I think that if someone was genuinely unhappy with the choices they were forced to vote for and decided to vote for neither, their opinions are just as relevant as someone who didn't support one candidate or the other.tldr edit: I feel that someone who was displeased with both candidates has as much of a valid opinion as someone who is displeased with the current president-elect, even if they could/""should"" have put their vote towards third party as a symbolic gesture. Additionally, no, I'm not one of these people, before anybody asks."

damr5uz,Skarthe,"I know a fair number of people who hate Trump, but didn't want to give Hillary a guaranteed SCOTUS pick, with a couple of other likely ones soon. That group took a candidate that even they thought was terrible because they figure it'll be better in the long run - Trump can only last 8 years, but SCOTUS justices are much longer-term.It's weird to think, then, that Hillary may have done better had Scalia not died."
dan8q56,Stooby,"The Supreme Court picks was the top answer for most important issue in exit polls. So, I think that is a very large reason. It is also why evangelicals turned out in record numbers. They think they can stack the court and ban abortion."

dan1mqf,GenesisEra,"> Moving further left is not a winning strategySo it's either status quo or moving even further right?

He's the buffoon that everyone laughed at on reality TV, the guy who was caught on tape basically admitting to sequel assault, he is the guy who consistently believes conspiracy theories and attacks anyone who isn't on his side. Clinton lost to that. If the Republicans put forth just a run of a mill lifelong Republican candidate, they would have crushed Clinton. I don't know a single person who wanted to vote for her or supported her. I live in a swing state that was pretty close in voting, and I saw only a handful of yards with Clinton signs. No one wanted her, they just didn't want Trump. That's a massive failure on the part of the Democrats."

damtpbt,Punishtube,They adopted a position on Syria and Russia that no one wanted or gave a shit about. They should have shut their mouths about what in particular about foreign policy they wanted.
dan1oj2,GenesisEra,This election was centre right vs. far right.
dan2cej,Penuwana,"Not really, the political scale in this country has not changed that drastically over the past 8 years..I mean is supporting ownership of ""assault weapons"" far right? And TPP center right? NAFTA is to the right?I would argue center right (many of Trump's propositions were not conservative in the least) vs left leaning."
dan354s,GenesisEra,"Well, I was referring to this election specifically.Hillary has shown herself to have more hawkish tendencies as compared to Obama with regards to security and the Middle East, and while she's progressive with regards to trade her previous record on taxes prior to her campaign were more modest.Meanwhile, Trump's campaign saw his advocating cutting off TPP and imposing tariffs and other taxes on Mexico for his wall (in countenance to NAFTA), a shift away from international laws and institutions and possibly a return of waterboarding. Rhetoric or not, that's a bit more extreme than what prior Republican presidential candidates have gone for.Also, America in general is a bit more to the right on average as compared to, say, Europe."
dan4j76,Penuwana,"I don't know if it is appropriate to say that torture is a far-right ideal, although it may find more support from the right. I agree with you that we lean further right as a whole than Europe, but the political scale of international politics is hard to apply to the United States due to this."
damtw42,meatduck12,"Wut? Democrats don't occupy the left, they are center to center right, especially Clinton's wing."
damufei,Penuwana,"Doesn't mean that the DNC's voter base isn't to the left. This scale, left/right, I am applying to politics in this nation solely. The support for continuation of aggression with Russia was for a long time found in the RNC much more than that of the DNC."
damuk7j,meatduck12,"The emergence of the Green Party has made the Democrats a centrist party anyways. Plus Weld, the Libertarian VP, practically endorsed Clinton, so Democrats aren't leftist by any means. Now that the Democrats have pivoted right, despite trying to appear liberal in their platform, they're starting to become much more pro-intervention than before."
damuv92,Penuwana,"There are plenty of issues the DNC is still left on, such as gun control. Compared to the Republicans, the DNC represents the left of the spectrum in this nation. The Green Party is pretty irrelevant, with Jill Stein further bringing them down."

damm09s,ijustwanttogohome2,How bad does she have to be viewed to lose to him though?
damq1zq,Jaxyl,That's how I explained it to my debaters after they questioned why Donald Trump wasn't ruined when any of his many scandals broke. Negative publicity is harmful to a candidate when you have an opponent that is well liked. Take Obama: his approval and likability ratings are at an all time high because people are constantly comparing Trump to him.The problem is that Hillary Clinton had terrible likability and trustworthiness numbers so when you compared Trump's latest scandal to Clinton you had a decreased effect because they're both bad. It's all about perception and the Clinton campaign let Trump and co. control her image because of reasons (hubris/they thought the electorate was smarter/etc...). Mind you the Clinton campaign didn't really try that hard to fight the allegations (i.e. when the head of the DNC is implicated in a scandal of corruption that benefited your campaign you don't hire her when she steps down).It all boils down to comparisons. Trump got away with it because Clinton had such negative perception that all of his scandals weren't viewed through a proper lens.
damrxfm,Penuwana,"Personally I see Trump as a blunt tool, and Hillary as a lethal, yet poorly aimed, weapon. She has gone too far in trying to hide her questionable actions to be trusted, while Trump just shrugs them off for the most part. That probably is reflected by many of the voters this year."
damtzd7,Jaxyl,"The other side, to me at least and this is my personal opinion with nothing to support my claim, is that our societal perception of Trump was different compared to Clinton. Now this isn't a sexism thing, it's more about the US' perception of the perceived wrong.The US hate cheaters and those that cheat the system. While I think, deep down, we all know that politics is somewhat dirty, we don't like to acknowledge it. Instead we turn a blind eye to the issues so long as they aren't glaring us in the face or cross certain lines. In Hillary's case, the e-mail situation exposed the underworkings of Washington in a way we haven't seen since Nixon. I liken it to the sausage analogy: Everyone loves sausage but they definitely don't want to know how it's made.From there we saw those same connections in the DNC and how they were used to actively hold down a surging challenger (note: I'm not looking to debate whether Sanders would have won without the DNC collusion, point is we'll never know because the game was different from the start). This gave Clinton a perception of a cheater that couldn't be denied. Mind you Republicans have been ""stacking the deck"", so to speak, for decades but they've never been caught this red handed before, so Clinton was alone and branded by public perception as someone who actively cheated to succeed. This, in turn, meant that any extra allegations were going to have an amplifying effect on her because she was already being viewed as negatively as she was.Trump, on the other hand, got away with it because of our countries racist and sexist history. Now I'm not saying we're racist or sexist anymore, but we have a lot of artifacts from that time in our society, namely Baby Boomers (not all, but some). I'd argue that most of us know at least one older to elderly person who is a great person with a lot of heart, they just happen to be a racist/sexist/whatever. This desensitizes us to a degree because when we see these people we, on average, ignore their respective-isms to accept them for the other parts of them. In the case of Trump, I feel like a lot of his supporters disagreed with him on a lot of his positions but accepted the rest of him because it's what we do to others.Of course that doesn't make it right and this is literally the ramblings of a single person on the internet with waaaay too much time on their hands (sitting at debate tournaments as a coach can get super boring). There is nothing to prove this and I 100% recognize that you, or anyone else, could just say it's bullshit and move on.Just wanted to share and see your thoughts."

Meanwhile Clinton has better, and more progressive, policies than Trump could ever hope to have. This election was not won or lost based on rational consideration of the facts. As I've said, I voted for Bernie in the primaries, I'm a huge supporter of his, but if Clinton couldn't beat Trump then I see no reason the believe that Sanders could have beat Trump."
damuily,meatduck12,"One reason: populism. Both Trump and Sanders were promising to improve the economic conditions of the poor in downtrodden areas. The economy was the key issue this election. Since Clinton never shook off those ties to Wall Street, and spoke in support of deals like NAFTA and TPP(the ""gold standard""? Seriously?), she wasn't able to win over the support of these people.

Bush and Cheney ""lossed"" some 2 million emails during their time in the White House and they had some 60 embassy attacks with over 100 dead and.There wasn't a single investigation into either of those things. So you tell me when they care so much about this one person and not about others, but don't sit there and act like the two sides are the same, cause they fucking aren't right now."
danztae,Penuwana,"I don't care about Bush, he is done. The pursuit of justice should not end because it did not find those deserving of it.

dao05xh,h3rbd3an,"I brought up Bush in response to your ""Are we to believe all the negative light shed on HRC is faked?"" Question. I'm showing you that while the issues might not be faked, they might be overblown.But to compare apples to apples. Trump recently settled a lawsuit for fraud, his ""Charity"" is under investigation, and he himself has some evidence of ties to Russia.So you want to talk about a ""highly influential millionaire abusing"" power take a look at the supposed billionaire as the President-elect and see how he abuses power. Its all over the place."

dao1rb8,Penuwana,"But yet who got most all the endorsements and CNN? I mean, hell, Fox was touchy on supporting Trump.

The DNC scandal was reported on for what, three days? His sexual abuse stuff? His character defamation? Most news networks turned their focus on him, and not in a positive light. GWB and others may have gotten away with similar, but this doesn't mean the precedent shouldn't be set by actually upholding the law which people like them legislated into place.."
dao3e0p,h3rbd3an,"Yea cause Trump is the most unqualified person we have probably ever had as our president. So of course he's not getting endorsements.Our society and media did him a HUGE favor be even treating him like a legitimate candidate. They should have been treating him like the joke he is right from the start. But instead they gave him a disproportionate amount of airtime, maybe thinking he would hang himself. The only problem with that is that they didn't realize that the GOP doesn't believe in rope.The DNC ""scandal"" wasn't a scandal. Is it morally wrong that they worked with Hillary more than Bernie? Absolutely, but there is zip illegal about it. Meanwhile Trump ADMITS TO SEXUAL ASSAULT and you're dumb ass compares the two like they are the same. They aren't, one is an actual crime and the other is a problem with our system.Fuck I was just reading another article where Trump himself said he didn't know how big the job really was. He probably still doesn't really grasp it. So congrats you could have elected someone who was bad but at least knew what the job entailed, but instead you shot off all our feet so that you could ""drain the swamp"" and fill it with fucking billionaires and bank executives.

Yea I am angry, I am mad and I have a certain hatred for those people. I have recently become really good friends with a gay couple, I am married, and I have friends who are first generation immigrants. We just collectively told them that Hillary's emails are more important to us than equality. We told all of those people that we don't care about them getting a fair shake as much as we do about ""sticking it to the man"" or some Bullshit. We told them that we are cool if they get relegated to 2nd class citizens. We are okay with sexual assault, and we are okay with Gay people getting discriminated against because of how they were born.I get that there are a lot of people that have legitimate concerns with Hillary's policies, I get that as I have many myself. But basic human equality was on the ballot this year, and we collectively said, ""Yea we don't care about that"". So yea I am mad at these idiots because they are telling my friends that they aren't important in this world, and that doesn't sit right with me and I'm not ashamed of that and I won't be told that I have to accept it cause I won't, and I will keep being mad because my friends are going to need a voice in the future."

Also within the last 8 years Obama had to sign an executive order to make it illegal for people to discriminate against Gay people. So to suggest that we don't need to worry about that is ridiculous.Now I'm not saying that it will happen but its not fear mongering to tell people that Mike Pence advocates for Gay conversion therapy. Its not fear mongering to tell people that Pence has said Trump will undo the executive order Obama signed to ban gay discrimination. That's not fear mongering, that just keeping people informed."

As you have shown its legalization is actually closer than I stated which means it is all the more likely to be under attack.You try to say that LGBT rights are here to stay, I say that isn't necessarily true citing the relatively recentness of gay marriage legalization and you say I'm wrong because gay marriage actually happened even closer to current time than I initially indicated. Yea, and I'm the stupid one."
dapo9mg,Penuwana,">Gay Marriage has only been legal nationwide for like 5 years?>nationwideI mean, generally if you want to sound like you know what you are talking about, you don't say things which are incorrect. I realize why some may fear a loss of LBGT rights, but that's pretty unrealistic and would require overturning of a SCOTUS decision. Congress would not vote in light of banning gay marriage.

danlvt7,meatduck12,"I sure hope so, but that's not what the public did when Reagan gutted social programs and made the rich richer. And again with Bush, by 2010 it was like his policies never happened to them."
dan4a1o,xCaffeineQueen,"What the majority of people are missing here is the level of corruption that is in our government. Trump appeared to not be as corrupt as Hillary, voting for him and seeing his actions is what will show us where our government really stands.We can keep on playing this bullshit game of talking shit about other people's intelligence, or we can band the hell together and get corruption out of our system. This division really irks me in a way nothing else can because **it doesn't have to be this way.** It would be nice if people stopped being assholes to each other and began to look at this situation collectively, as in what can we do together to fix our government? A vote for Hillary would've been a vote for ""Yeah, she's corrupt, but social problem progress!"" but a vote for Trump is displaying just how far elitist ties go."
dauxn3f,34NC,How exactly is that possible when the President elect is a massive bully. You're asking people to be logical and work together when the leader himself refuses to do so.
daxijun,xCaffeineQueen,"You have a legitimate point, usually for people to work together there has to be a common goal established, normally by a leader, to get it done. *But* I think the dynamic of that can change because of the internet."
dangp6h,math-yoo,"A vote for Hillary was a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Are we saving the courts, are we continuing social progress, a woman president is important, she's being slimed by the republicans again, etc.Trump had one message, everything is shit, and a vote for him was a vote against shit. At least to his supporters. And he used his message a a cudgel against everything they threw at him."
dan41w7,pearlsweet,A friend of mine just postponed buying a house. He is worried about a recession due to all republican controlled government and an economic apocalypse under Trump.

I don't agree with some of his cabinet picks either but most of them are not as bad as the scaremongers in the media claim.The MSM is absolutely disgusting, including right wing groups such as Fox News and Breitbart, Obama should take a great deal of [blame for this](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/) and I hope Trump does do something about the press, its impossible to find the truth from any single news corporation anymore, you have to go to aggregators and decide for yourself.The 'most progressive platform in history' is an absolute joke. Hillary Clinton is far more of a centrist than any other democrat in history and completely beholden to the elites. She is out of touch with the average person and corrupt to the core. She'll say anything to get votes even if it doesn't correspond with her private views and doesn't give a shit about anything other than furthering herself.Trump has a lot of flaws but between the two there is no comparison."

They just hear that over and over again and then become convinced of it without actually understanding what the concerns are. So what, specifically, are you afraid of?"
damo12j,zugunruh3,"I'm afraid he's going to do what he promised Evangelicals he'll do and appoint a SC justice with the intent of eliminating nationwide gay marriage, in which case my marriage will be in jeopardy (again). I'm afraid he's going to stand by his pledge to sign the First Amendment Defense Act to make it federally legal to refuse LGBT people jobs, housing, and medical care on the basis of ""religious beliefs"", and not only will people people die* but it will be state sanctioned. I'm afraid for all the LGBT children who have absolutely no hope for the next 4 years at minimum and no control over their lives if their parents decide they want to send them to a torture camp in an attempt to make them stop being LGBT. Is that fucking enough to be afraid of?*This isn't an assumption, there are plenty of cases or LGBT people being refused long term and emergency medical care and dying because of it, and that was without a promise from the federal government that nothing bad will happen to them."
damo9y9,vVvMaze,"That would be a legitimate fear if it were true. He said he doesnt want to reverse gay marriage. Its already been decided and staying as such. The left wing media does nothing but paint these fears into everyone's heads in order to get their votes. Its scare tactics. This is a major major problem that has gotten so worse during this election process. Ive even heard women saying that they are afraid of Trump because he will take all their rights away. What!? First of all, women have had rights for decades and no one has even once said they want to take away women's rights. And second of all, the President actually doesnt have the power to do that. At all. Even if he wanted to, which he doesnt. But they just hear these scare tactics from a biased media outlet and they become convinced of it. We live in a post-fact age. Meaning that news outlets say what they want to say to influence someone's feelings as opposed to actually posting the truth. Facts dont matter anymore, only feelings. And if we can change their feelings, we can change their vote. Its actually kind of concerning. There is so much fake news out there that its become hard to tell what is real and what isnt."
damog9e,zugunruh3,"He's on [fucking video this year](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/donald-trump-trust-me-to-overturn-the-shocking-gay-marriage-decision) saying the gay marriage decision was shocking and that evangelicals could trust him to appoint a judge to overturn the decision. If they're scare tactics they're scare tactics that Trump himself has put out there. And the statement from his own fucking campaign website that he [plans to sign the FADA](http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2016/09/donald-trump-pledges-sign-anti-lgbtq-first-amendment-defense-act/). I don't know why the hell you're talking about women since I didn't bring that up at all, are you confusing me with someone else?"
damoqwq,vVvMaze,"In the video that you posted as an example, he didnt say anything about overturning the decision. He did say he was shocked by it but he fully supported the decision being left up to the states. He was shocked that it wasnt left up to the states. Didnt hear a thing about trying to get it overturned."

But he wants a plan that covers everyone without costing tons of money which Obamacare does. He doent just want to leave people to die. Thats a liberal manipulation tactic to scare people. You need to look at what is scare tactics and what are facts. In regards to people being deported....yes, that probably will split up families. But what are you supposed to do with tons of illegal immigrants? Just let them stay because they are here already? Then whats the point of having an immigration process? Of course its not nice but at the same time, there needs to be enforcement in regards to immigration. That is not Trump's fault if people are here illegally, its the immigrant's fault for not going to the immigration process. Canada has a stricter immigration process than the United States does but I dont hear anyone getting up in arms about that. Its because its been established and enforced for so long that its just normal. But here, theres been no enforcement and the process is not refined. So as a leader should do, protect the borders, he wants to get an immigration policy in place like every other major country has.Refugees is a tricky one. Should refugees be accepted? Yes. But not an infinite amount. And when you look at other countries that already took in a bunch of refugees there has been confirmed issues with taking in too many at once. There needs to be a process for it, not just open doors. The left labels these processes as being racist, again as a way to force an agenda. This isnt racist. It would be the same process no matter what color the person is. Its the exact opposite of racism. Its treating everyone equally, but because the refugees are not white (many of them are actually) its suddenly racist."
damorkw,DeadlyPear,">There needs to be a process for it, not just open doors.There is already, the US has one of the most rigorous vetting processes for refugees in the word. The left isn't calling for open doors, they want to give refugees the chance to go through that process."

Weak candidate, weak campaign, weak voter turnout where it mattered."
dan0g0i,telegetoutmyway,This is pretty much it. Bernie got cheated. And Bernie would've beat him. This is coming from someone who wasn't voting Bernie.
dan906c,Stooby,"Bernie would not have beat him. He has narrow appeal and would not appeal to the wider swath of general election voters. He benefited from being an unknown individual against someone that people didn't like and both he and Hillary avoided negative campaigning in the primary. As soon as the Eye of Sauron focused on Bernie he would have been toast. Far too large of the voting population lived during the midst of the Cold War. A self-proclaimed socialist is still a boogey-man to them.The whole campaign would have been non-stop calling him a commie because he had a Soviet flag hanging from his office door years ago, and because he had a history of supporting communist and socialist revolutions and regimes, and the ""breadlines"" quote.Bernie was also just not popular at all with a huge chunk of the base. Black voters and Hispanic voters just didn't like him. They are the reason he lost the primary.I really, really like Bernie, and would love for his politics to take on a bigger role in the DNC platform, but he didn't stand a chance in the presidential election.EDIT:I know to us it seems like no big deal for someone to be a communist, but the vast majority of us active reddit posters didn't grow up in a time period where there was REAL and JUSTIFIED fear that the commies were going to nuke us out of existence."
danfrl8,,"Ok, first of all, America's hands are pretty bloody for our short existence. It's incredibly naive, delusional, irrational, ignorant, and bat shit nuts to think capital republics are any less brutal, oppressive, pro ruling elite, favor the wealthy, and have engaged in toppling democratic nations to prop up dictators in order to profit.Communist haters dont seem to look in the mirror very honestly. People who rag on other form of governments need to remember our own blood stains."
dankbb9,Stooby,"That came out of nowhere. I made no claim in my comment about the pros/cons of communist regimes...There was also a real and justified fear that we would nuke them out of existence, and that fuels their fear and distrust of the USA even to this day. However, from our perspective the fear was that they would nuke us."

dan4nll,underbridge,"Right, well, both are ridiculous arguments. If Bernie was screwed, then so was O'Malley."
damuji6,HurricaneRon,"It's the party's fault for not convincing people to go vote for Clinton. It was a horribly ran campaign and there's no denying that. People need to want to vote for someone, not against someone. You aren't going to win an election if you're relying on people to vote against someone."
damv857,underbridge,"Economic Justice (Bernie) was way more important than social justice (Hillary). It's the economy, stupid. That should have been her campaign message. Bill would have been a great surrogate this election talking about an economic message. He's even more effective than Bernie speaking about kitchen table issues. And, instead, they focused on ""Interest Group for Hillary"". Look, I'm not happy that Hillary lost. But, blaming her for beating Bernie is not the right answer. Progressives can win for president. We just need them to get more votes in the primary, regardless of what the DNC wants. We have the votes."

dan51q7,NecroNarwhal,"Yes, let's hold those who didn't know accountable for other's actions.

Scandals aside, these things are important to me and even if she changed her tune for this election and says she's not about all that anymore it just rings hollow in my ears.

The thing is that since there was no sensible reason to mention the woman part as a pronoun there in that sentence, we can deduce that it wasn't placed there to identify that there was a specific woman they wanted to punish, but instead they wanted to punish *a woman*.If it was as you say, he'd have said Hillary Clinton instead of a woman. There's no reason to specify that it is a woman unless you're making a point about it.Substitute it with Democrat.

His victories there were only a surprise to people too dumb to realize how many jobs had been lost there due to outsourcing, which he is against.4) Kate Steinle - that pisses people off whether you wanna admit it or not5) TONS of terrorists attacks that- trigger warning- were basically all perpetrated by Islamic extremists working under the influence of ISIS- something Obama/Clinton could've easily overcome long ago.These are just a few of the reasons people full-on supported Trump. Qualification is a shitty platform either way because Trump has no experience, Hillary basically did nothing useful as SoS (bad experience) so she would've sucked even more in a higher office- neither of them were 'qualified'. People voted for Trump because they were sick of seeing their nation head down the path it was going. That was reflected in their vote."

Big states like California are not properly represented in the portion of the electoral college that should correlate with population, and in the House for that matter.

This isn't a major issue for me as I don't smoke, but if I did there is literally nothing else a presidential candidate could do (or not do) that would have a greater effect on me personally since I live in a prohibition state.

Think how much more Americans will vote for Progress as presented by an actual progressive. I am very excited by the idea that America has this giant progressive undercurrent that is only held back by a conservative establishment, and only when they do everything in their power to restrict voting rights and gerrymander the districts and rely on a system that effectively gives conservative rural people extra votes. So, eventually it seems as though the system is going to snap under all that tension and progressivism will take over, and that certainly will be beautiful (I hope). Because once progressives actually win big, they could just unjerrymander (or regerrymander, hopefully not, but they might) everything and create a surge in voting rights that would cause a massive upshoot in support, by breaking the tension keeping that support back. But this also brings me fear, because I think most conservatives are aware of this too. And I think that their response might actually be fascistic. It might actually be to start creating tests to restrict voting to more and more conservative people. I can only hope the future doesn't suck."

damndtd,Verbluffen,> Democrats won a majority of votes for the PresidentPlurality. I know it's easy to mixup but the distinguishment is important. A majority of Americans also voted *against* Hillary. That still suggests a serious need for improvement.
damnhmy,-Gaka-,">Americans voted for progress, but our system elected regress. I disagree - the system didn't elect regression. Progress and regress are all entirely subjective.For example, I think that most gun control is mostly a regressive thing. Controlling what types of stocks and magazine limits and ammunition restrictions isn't going to stop violence or suicides or whatever ""evil"" things guns are used for. They're a tool and nothing more. If you ban guns, folks will just use the next most efficient tool... though that's dumbing down the argument by a lot.But there is an argument to be made that removing the *most* efficient option will make it less appealing (if that's the word) to commit violent crimes. It's pretty easy to rob someone with a gun, but a little harder to do with a knife. Is that enough discouragement? Is trying to keep people safe any more or less progressive than allowing them freedom to bear arms to defend themselves or to provide food?Of course, there is that whole ""right to bear arms"" thing...I also think that marijuana should be decriminalized, if not totally legalized. It's just like alcohol or caffeine or tobacco, with far fewer negative effects. For some people it even acts as a useful medical tool. Making it illegal does more harm than good. That's my ""progressive"" view.On the flip side, it can be argued that keeping marijuana illegal is a good thing for the country in that there are abuse cases. Perhaps you enjoy the feeling of being high, and so you start to smoke more of it until it's basically what you do on your downtime. (see chain smoking and those lovely alcoholics) The simple function of being high can be seen as a huge negative. When you're high or otherwise incapacitated, how does your work get impacted? Are you performing at 100%? Is trying to ensure that work gets done any more or less progressive than allowing personal freedom?It's really all relative."

damsei7,ThatParkerKid,"Clinton had a 2 million vote lead over Trump in the popular vote. She had 1.5% more votes. That's pretty much nothing when compared to other notable elections. In 2008 Obama had the popular vote lead by about 7%, that's over 4x more. 2 million people is about .63% of the entire population of the US. If her lead had been substantially more she might have more basis to re-run and your claim might carry some more weight.Also the electoral system is actually quite genius in reality. Democrats can't just hold onto giant liberal states like California, New York and Illinois and throw in the towel. Similarly, Republicans can't own Texas and the rest of the south and pull a win out if it. The system is there to make sure every region has a fairly substantial say in the election. Historically the system has still just let Republicans and Democrats hold on to their huge states. But because of the electoral college those huge states don't just automatically win the election due to sheer size."

damtdhu,dont4geturhere4ever,"What world are you living in where Obama's administration has been tolerant of medical marijuana?From 1996 to 2013, the federal government conducted 528 raids on medical marijuana dispensaries. 270 of them were from Obama's first term.Source:http://american-safe-access.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/WhatsTheCost.pdf"
damsjn7,Penuwana,"The Obama administration spent more than the Bush administration on raids, increasing spending on raids by 33%. He isn't what he says he is."
damwceh,SpitfireIsDaBestFire,The DEA did the same shit with Obama in office so I don't know what you're talking about.
damkmhq,Schmedes,Want to fund a shit ton of DEA raids? Legalize and tax marijuana and use that money to run all of your corrupt raiding against the other drugs.
damkoa1,angstybagels,"No no, let's make kratom a felony and bank off that and bring more heroin in."
damly52,funkboxing,I'm pretty sure that's their actual planEDIT - [reminder today is the last day to include a public comment for the decision to schedule Kratom](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DEA-2016-0015-0006)
damlztb,akatherder,"Or legalize heroin and use the money from that to fund weed drug raids. They're both schedule 1, lol."
damoc1f,budcub,This was part of Ron Paul's platform when he ran for president in 1988 (under the Libertarian Party).
damog2t,Schmedes,I was mostly joking in regards to the raids but I honestly do think it'd be a smart plan.
damjnqq,Byzantine279,Sporadic? Fuck no. He's going to start a full blown war.
damjrhd,angstybagels,Do we get cool uniforms at least?
damjv5l,Byzantine279,"Orange ones, yes."
damsv13,brazilliandanny,Don't forget cracking down on banks dealing with legal pot money. A lot of legal pot shops can't deposit their money as national banks are afraid to touch it as it's still illegal on a federal level. Kind of hard to run your legal small business if you can't even use a bank.
damk73w,GideonWainright,"Also, the DEA's resources are not infinite. If Sessions raids dispensaries, then that means there are agents not focusing on hard drugs or marijuana operations in non legalized states. All the while, he's pissing off the locals who resent federal government intrusion by an Administration that failed to capture the popular vote. The important thing with legalization isn't only the dispensaries but that the state's resources are largely unavailable to the federal government, making enforcement very difficult and probably little more than symbolic. Some of the legalized operators will return to the underground and we'll have a more wild west type of market as was in California where operators largely flout the law while doing just enough of a fig leaf of legality to avoid state and local prosecution and take their chances. This could undermine the case for legalization. But, from my experience in California it actually cements the case for legalization because we want things regulated properly to get rid of the most disruptive groups or get them to settle down (i.e. the ones who engage in bad farming practices, crime, etc.). Now, we have someone to personify the argument that prohibition creates more problems then it solves -- Attorney General Sessions. Sure, the West Coast is strongly blue in the urban areas, but the states can get bluer. Especially in the rural districts where conservatism is defined by a hostility towards intrusive government. Also, they risk further alienating voters in Colorado and Nevada, which the Republicans do not want to see further erosion. Obama is making these remarks because marijuana is an excellent future wedge issue for the midterms. Plenty of conservatives, especially the libertarian-inclined, like smoking pot too or think paying 40-50k a year to incarcerate someone for smoking or selling marijuana is stupid. Lots of people who smoke pot don't vote, especially in the midterm elections. If you tell them, vote straight ticket Democrat and you'll eventually be able to access better quality weed at a lower price without fear of federal prosecution, they might show up for the midterms. Appointing Sessions as AG looks like a strategic blunder and I'm surprised it happened under Bannon's watch. Either Sessions is already reigned in (he can go after civil rights for minorities and the immigrants, but not weed) or Bannon is not nearly as clever as I think he is."
damltg0,,Hopefully some local cops have the balls to arrest them (the DEA agents)
damm9r7,Michaelbama,"Federal agents raiding your house illegally for reasons where state laws say they can't?""Sheesh, officer, I just shot the guys illegally breaking into my house!"""
damli41,zoolian,Fun fact: Obama's DEA [raided Montana pot dispensaries in 2011](http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/03/16/montana.marijuana.raids/index.html) even though we have a medical marijuana law and the dispensaries were operating within the law.So Obama pretending to be pro-marijuana NOW instead of actually doing something 6 or 7 years ago is the height of hypocrisy.
damfvta,joltto,I feel like things would start shutting down quick if feds started raiding dispensaries consistently.
dami98o,Augustus_Caesar1,It didn't work when only two states were medical...Why would it work now with several fully legal?
damyj5j,hoarmurath,Because it's closer to all of them legalizing.
dami9vs,VoyageofCollosus,"Along the entire west coast states? Fuck no. Legalization has become so big that the amount of money that the feds would be wasting to lock up people would be astronomical. There would be such an outcry as well from those people living in those states that have legalized. Plus, as Colorado and Oregon and all the other states that have legalized have shown, the tax money that those states are bringing in is HUGE, so I doubt that the feds would want to shut legalization down, particularly because of that.However, at this point there isn't much Obama can do really to help legalization efforts. I mean he could issue an executive order but what good would that do in the face of the incoming administration."
dammkm0,Judge_Bredd2,"Having the DEA crack down is something we're afraid of here in Colorado. Everyone of us working in the legal weed industry have all of our information including current address, fingerprints, and any tattoos/scars in a nice convenient list at the MED office in Denver. If the DEA got their hands on that list it wouldn't take them long to round a significant number of us up as a show of force."

damrppk,pepedelafrogg,"Which is why we'd have a referendum rather than just declaring it by fiat. Quebec almost left Canada twice and Scotland almost left the UK (pre-Brexit, and they'd probably get it if they tried again) through referendums."
damujd8,ThrowAwayHRC,The US isn't Canada or the UK. There is no current legal mechanism for states to secede in the US save for a successful revolution. A California referendum would be laughed out of federal court.
dan9zec,,"Yeah, Canada passed a law specifically allowing Quebec to secede if they voted to. Pretty unprecedented at the time, a country opening a path to civil dissolution."
damsm6e,The-JerkbagSFW,"You know, there was kind of a large conflict a few years back about being able to leave the US. It was in all the papers and everything. Think it was called... The Civil War? Something like that."
dampz3z,Judge_Bredd2,It's only legal on the state level. They could still send us to a federal court to go to federal prison if they felt like it.
damoi1z,Rindan,"Imagine the weed store next to you gets raided. The cops steal everything, and then lock up the owner, employees, and investors for selling and possessing huge amounts of weed. Everyone involved goes to jail for a couple of decades. Even knowing the Feds don't have the resources to get you all, do to stay in business and just hope they don't go for you? Fuck no. You close down because dying in jail and having everything you own stolen is terrifying. The more that close down, the higher the risk to those who try and roll the dice. It doesn't take long before everyone retreats to the black market again.Trump can shut it all down if he wants to pay the political price. It sure is a good and easy way throw another Molotov cocktail into the windows to the coastal liberals that a lot of his followers would really enjoy. He doesn't need Massachusetts out California. Hell, we don't even now if he wants to be president for 8 years. 4 might be enough for his massive ego, and it lets him get out before the decent economy Obama dumped in his lap collapses again."
damyi1g,hoarmurath,Well put.
damoamy,brothersand,"Send in the DEA and Federal Authorities to raid and imprison people running dispensaries then promote a special ""federal license"" that a company must obtain to run a dispensary. Only give these licenses to dispensaries run by Phillip Morris or other large tobacco companies that give your reelection campaigns millions of dollars. Just business in Trump's America."
damo2br,paradox1984,"Obama had 8 years to deschedule and didn't. Had he lifted the prohibition and changed enforcement and helped get sensible federal policy in place years ago, then it would have been hard to undo. If he does something last minute now it will get reversed. I voted for him in 08 and didn't vote in 12. I thought he would do something about this and it is a big disappointment that he did virtually nothing at the federal level."
damozdp,ThrowAwayHRC,"Exactly. He was too scared of losing seats in the house to do anything sooner. But I think he miscalculated how much ground he would have MADE, not lost on it....."
damzdt7,VoyageofCollosus,"It truly is. And i like obama as a person, just not as a politician. Id say that his two biggest failures of his terms were not acting on syria when Assad had that brutal crackdown during the arab spring and Obamacare is a poor shade of what he intended it to be thanks to republicans cannibalizing it and turning it into the massive, pricey monstrosity that it is. I really believe his vision was to have everyone in the country to have healthcare. Well, and this is a gross underestimation here, however many hundreds of thousands have obamacare but it sure as hell is still not affordable."
dan07bv,paradox1984,"It is a missed opportunity. I think he could have used his popularity and likability to kind of say screw it and take unilateral executive action that an overwhelming majority of Americans support. I don't even smoke myself. I prefer ipa and Belgian style beers and other hoppy goodness. It was relatively recently that laws were changed so that you could get beer above 6% in my state when you could have bought golden grain. The prohibition of marijuana makes no sense and lack of movement on the federal level is a reason I am disappointed in Obama for whom I voted in 08 but abstained in 12. He let the states hang in limbo and ""legal"" state distributors live in an ambiguous status federally with respect to prosecution. He admitted to inhaling: ""that was the point."" It's too late now."

damg0ed,skinnytrees,Really quickThe risk of going to prison for 20 years on federal drug charges wont be worth your stand of keeping your dispensary runningBack to dealers we all go
damhwqp,,Nah. There are now 10s of thousands of people who work in the legal pot industries who have to pay the mortgage and make rent. The states will resist. I know you are the defendor of Trump and the conservative agenda around here but you just don't understand how much of the culture and economy cannabis is in the west at this point. It's not the 90s or even 2000s anymore. Sessions can try to stop it but it would be by withholding highway finds and the states he would do it to can all afford to give him the finger and pay the price. Even if they try to make an example out of it it's still legal to grow personal and medicinal so what are they going to do randomly raid 2 million households? Yeah right.
damlaoe,sansaset,hhahah seriously how do people think a state like Colorado is going to give up their dispensaries after all the tax monies they've collected?
dampqd7,xshare,Colorado isn't the one going to jail -- all it takes is making *individuals* not want to risk it.
damxrbk,GunNutYeeHaw,Retailers will. It won't be worth the risk. One raid on one large store with felony charges dispensed liberally is probably all it would take.
dan7hmh,snakeaway,And then it could spun as big government and recorded and memed to death. Say big government coming down on states rights enough and loud enough you can pin them in a corner. Democrats maybe lack strategy.

damwmcs,flounder19,He *might* leave the states alone but here in DC I expect that we're fucked

daolp1o,flounder19,"legal to grow, legal to own, legal to use in private, the smell isn't usable as probable cause, legal to give as a gift, illegal to sell but I think technically legal to buy.The reason we can't sell it here is that Congress tried to block legalization entirely by restricting any DC funds from being used to ""enact any law, rule, or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, use, or distribution of any schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) or any tetrahydrocannabinols derivative for recreational purposes."". Our mayor stood up to them and said that the legalization itself was enacted when it was voted on but it keeps us from altering the laws further to set up a legal means of purchasing it."
dan65yo,derpdurka,"A good number of people in this sub behave as though a downvote towards unpleasant news is the same as fighting for the good cause.

A plurality of the electorate in over half a dozen states extremely angry at you. Hypocrisy shown in terms of states' rights when they'll be pushing for stronger states' rights in several other issues. On top of this, Peter Thiel is in his ear and he's a large investor in legal cannabis. There's already too many special interests.Yeah... I know Sessions is a psycho and Trump is a loose cannon, but I think Trump is ultimately telling Sessions what he can and can't do if he wanted the job.

dammc6g,Deeptrance83,"I'm very much a liberal. I thought this too. However, and hear me out, if Sessions does pick a fight against legal weed, that means he MUST go after medical weed also. Since all weed is still illegal under Federal law, he won't be able to go after pot heads in Denver without also going after cancer patients and children with ALS who use it to manage ailments.And that is why I think he'll howl and scream and demonize it but not actually do anything about it. There's also the case that Congress has already passed legislation barring Federal funds from being used to prosecute weed in states where it is legal. His only chance will be to challenge the passage of legislation before it goes into effect (most likely that would be California's new law surrounding the legalization of recreational). That would get kicked through the courts, most likely up to the Supreme Court. This would really upset a LOT of country, since a huge majority of the country is pro medical weed. It's a zero sum game for him.Fighting weed also flys in the face of all of Trump's stances. I don't think he'll let Sessions prosecute a case against it."
dammc8a,Henrywinklered,"Sessions will go through Trump on everything he does. That's why Trump is picking the people he is - they're loyal. I would put a large sum of money down that Trump will not attempt to block legalization. Many Republicans, especially millennials and to a lesser degree baby-boomers smoke pot. Trump knows it's relatively harmless. Not to sound like some wanna-be prophet, but I've been dead-on about everything Trump has done since the beginning of his campaign, and I mean dead-on. He may not help push it (he indeed may), but he won't attack it."

I am consistently optimistic every time I patronize these CASH-ONLY businesses and am provided a ""high""-quality product with good customer service. Sessions, like all of Obama's appointees, may proclaim an anti-MJ position to save face or based on personal prejudices and biases however, the huge sums generated by taxes make their own argument which is increasingly impossible to ignore.TL;DR; I am optimistic all politicians will bow to the almighty dollar in the case of MJ."

damqap6,yourmomsfart,I doubt it. Trump is a populist and has a fundamental need to be liked. He knows a majority of the country is for legalization.

dan1pla,Rhamni,Yes. It's not looking good. I hope we're wrong.
danlvq2,goldandguns,It's not time to reschedule marijuana. We need to wait ~10 years for the tide to truly turn. Most people talk about taking it to schedule 2. We need it to be totally off the schedules.

The amount of people (specifically minorities) that have their lives screwed up and ruined for marijuana-related offenses is staggering. This is all while states are legalizing its use for recreational and medicinal purposes. It makes no sense and the continued criminality of its use and sale only acts to bolster institutional inequity in criminal justice and incarceration in the U.S. Obama - the GOP is going to wreck a lot of what you've worked for, but this may survive if you have the courage to do it."

The selling of illegal drugs is good money, it is danger money, you can get in to it even without a good CV. If weed us legalised then the selling of it becomes a proper job that requires a better CV and no longer has the danger money. Therefore dealer's to will have to find a new way to make good money illegallyEDIT: THIS IS NOT AN ARGUMENT AGAINST LEGALISATION, there are many valid reasons to leaglise. I was trying to say however it is unlikely to fix the problem of the disadvatnged being forced into life of crime to make money."
damtgrg,CatGrabber,"Your argument still does not logically end with continuing prohibition. A large portion of America has used weed and there are numerous states that have legalized it one way or another. It is simply no longer tenable to spend the resources for enforcement, to destroy lives and forego tax income for something that is demonstrably less bad than existing legal drugs (i.e., alcohol and tobacco). Your response has no connection to an argument against legalization. The thing is, possession is a great reason to stop and roust someone - it serves as a pretense. On parole and cost smoking weed? Have a prior offense for possession or distribution? Those things are leveraged by law enforcement and prosecutors. We know that drug arrests are disproportionately borne by minorities - so let's not keep this biased tool in the toolkit of law enforcement."

But from a supply angle the reason these people are in this business is because of the profitability and lack of competition from ""reputable"" business men."

damfido,bexmex,"He didn't do nothing, dude. He de facto decriminalized it when instructing his AG to not make it a priority... then about 10 states legalized it. Now is actually the ideal moment for fixing the problem.EDIT: a lot of comments below about how dispensaries were still raided by the Feds. Yes indeed they were. Some underlings ignored the president's order and raided legal dispensaries. Other times they raided those that were in violation of STATE law with local officers. Its still way better than nothing.If he decriminilized it the first day of his office, there would have been a backlash, and no state would have legal pot. That's just politics. Slow and frustrating, yes, but he did as much as could be done without a backlash."

damkce5,the_red_scimitar,"True, if you only look at the rhetoric and not what his administration actually DID after claiming they would not go after cannabis businesses in any state that they were legal in. The fact is, they raided and closed several long-standing, entirely compliant businesses in California. Large ones. Famous ones. There was definitely a war on cannabis long after this bullshit pronouncement. But you're right - he didn't do nothing, he just did his usual dance, complete with hand waving and mirrors. Pretty much the main skill of politicians."
damn4ks,somatic-,"This type of thinking is the reason cannabis legalization is going to take, and has taken, so long. The people who support it are unreliable voters who just drop out and stop engaging because of 'he just did his usual dance, complete with hand waving and mirrors.

Imagine the first black president trying to legalize pot under extremely dubious constitutional authority. This is the man who has been consistently painted as a secret kenyan muslim and everything he's tried to push through has become a political firestorm.Let's suppose Obama really wanted to legalize pot. Would he try and make it a major part of his legacy, which republicans would be sure to try and dismantle, or would he try and give the legalization movement legs by trying to encourage federal law enforcement not to go after states that have legalized, thereby allowing the movement to organize and gain financial backing?Ah fuck it. Obama is as bad as Jeff Sessions."

damwsn7,heyimamaverick,"No, whichever image leads to the least resistance and obstruction. I don't care how much resistance and obstruction he'd receive. He should be using any and all means to free those in jail for non-violent crime and to implement measures to prevent more from being incarcerated. It's unacceptable and people are suffering, and most people want the suffering to end. If the obstructionist wishes lead to more suffering and tearing apart of families and a reduction in education levels, then those obstructionists need to be circumvented by any means possible and the backlash can be dealt with later. They clearly don't actually want to be a part of the discussion, and if they don't need to be included in the legalization process, then let's not."

Or he could actually use his political capital and make the heads of those agencies do his bidding like my boss would to me. But that's with just my high school Gov/Econ course under my belt haha.As far as Obama getting shit on over this.... I think he deserves it. He talked a big game and has made a big deal about the criminal justice system the past 18 months. His rhetoric does NOT match his actions. You can't bitch and moan about the high number of non-violent arrests while simultaneously not using your powers to cut those numbers down. Obama ordered the IRS to target Tea Party PACs when the Tea Party first started, why can't he order the DEA to reschedule marijuana? Both agencies are directly under the executive branch after all."

The DEA is notorious for interfering with funding into studies about weed, and influencing the outcome.I think it would take pressure from congress to get them to act in a way to lower the schedule. But that's just my opinion about the DEA. They've got incentive through funding not to lower schedules and congress are the ones who control the purse strings. The president can tell them I want you to do this, look into it, but due to the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 they don't have to ultimately do it.The president can pressure them, but it's about what he's doing now, I think.

This request is sent to the Assistant Secretary of Health of the HHS. Then, the HHS solicits information from the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and evaluations and recommendations from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and on occasion, from the scientific and medical community. The Assistant Secretary, by authority of the Secretary, compiles the information and transmits back to the DEA a medical and scientific evaluation regarding the drug or other substance, a recommendation as to whether the drug should be controlled, and in what schedule it should be placed.>The medical and scientific evaluations are binding to the DEA with respect to scientific and medical matters. The recommendation on scheduling is binding only to the extent that if HHS recommends that the substance not be controlled, the DEA may not control the substance.>Once the DEA has received the scientific and medical evaluation from HHS, the Administrator will evaluate all available data and make a final decision whether to propose that a drug or other substance be controlled and into which schedule it should be placed.So yeah no where in there does it come even close to implying the president has direct control."

None. No bill, no Congress, no voting.And lol, your state's rights comment is entirely nullified by the fact it IS ON THE SCHEDULE.

damts5r,Bumblelicious,"And that's meaningless. ""Soapbox on a man's grave"" is self-righteous twaddle. People die, through age, illness, violence, accident, and suicide all the time. This doesn't mean the circumstances become off limits for discussion or context. And it's really not unreasonable to assume that his prosecution had something to do with the circumstances."
damt3rs,FirstTimeWang,"> True, if you only look at the rhetoric and not what his administration actually DID after claiming they would not go after cannabis businesses in any state that they were legal in.Hey now, he only said they were going to stop going after small-time users. Businesses doing hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of dollars a year in marijuana business are still fair game."

damu5qt,step1,Black man soft on marijuana. That'd certainly help the feelings going on in this country eh
dan4sfq,Bishizel,"The thing you need to think about is this. Obama had political capital, but every time he pushed something, he had to spend almost all of it. Should he have spent his political capital pushing something that was already happening naturally, in order to speed it along? Or was it better spent on other things like gay rights?He could have done more, but this ship was already sailing."
danq6m7,ddplz,"Yeah and the millisecond he is on his way out he does the whole ""oh I guess weed is OK after all"" and then leaves.He knew it from the start but obv didn't want to upset his donor overlords who control him."

damtej9,the_red_scimitar,"As I said, this was quite some time AFTER Obama said he'd instructed them to NOT raid or prosecute where the local regulations actually allowed the activity.Do *I* know whether he directly ordered it or not? Of course not. Neither do you. Nor anybody else you or I can reliably discover from.They were acting against his *publicly* stated orders, yet he said absolutely nothing about the raid, never did a thing to set it right. That business was simply up and destroyed in a single day, leaving hundreds, maybe thousands of patients, adrift. Those are just the facts that are clear."
dammep1,ericools,"Fuck that, the DEA is under his authority. Not making it a priority in legalized states is a pretty pathetic 'something'."

dampkmy,jon_k,"Yep.The president has a dictator-like control over the FDA and the DEA.The DEA has denied numerous requests by doctors to petition the DEA.Obama sat for 8 years and watched as nothing happened.Presidency is over, waits to make statement about how something should be done about this!!!!!Hahahahahaha.

dan6qb9,,"Wtf? Obama acts on a federal level, not a state level. just because two states legalized it doesn't mean that Obama did anything *in his power* to amend the laws at a federal level."
dan70jc,Tristanna,I never send he amended the law. I said he did more than any other president to move the country towards legalization. His policy of non-interference was the shade under which places like CO and WA grew successful industries. You can have whatever opinion on that you want but the fact is that a policy of non-interference is more than what any other president has done.
dan7bdg,,"> I said he did more than any other president to move the country towards legalization. No, *he* didn't. You don't get credit for sitting around, even if the rest of the team is working. Not working against marijuana legalization doesn't mean working towards marijuana legalizations. It means complacency."
dan7ky7,Tristanna,"Which presidents have done more for legalization? Which president's policies on the matter have results? I understand that you don't feel Obama did anything for the matter, and that is technically correct. He went with simply abstaining from action and this had positive effects on legalization efforts whether you acknowledge that or not."
dans1o1,,"Ask yourself what would have happened if WA and CO had voted to legalize under Bush, Trump, Reagan, Nixon, or even Clinton, and you'll understand what Obama did for legalization. Do you not remember the many decades our government spent spreading propaganda about cannabis destroying lives and acting as a gateway drug? Or how much *money* departments within the government have made in the War on Drugs? If you remembered the bad old days, you might appreciate the precedent Obama is setting instead of stomping your feet 'cause you didn't get everything you wanted right away."
danuzec,,"> and you'll understand what Obama did for legalizationNo. I'll understand what the voters in the states of WA and CO did for legalization while Obama sat around and said ""Legalize it!"" every so often. And your argument doesn't even make sense. It was within his power to do more to push towards legalization. He didn't utilize those powers. It doesn't matter what all ""he did"" for legalization in individual states. He didn't do all that he could have. That doesn't change."

damrfqc,flfxt,That's total BS. DoJ action against state-law-compliant marijuana facilities continued well into Obama's second term (even after Congress passed a bill seeking to defund such activities) and US attorneys serving at his pleasure continued to harass medical marijuana dispensaries even in the face of objections from city governments.

Slow and frustrating, yes, but he did as much as could be done without a backlash.Do you mean nothing? Do you mean saying stuff and then doing the exact opposite? Do you mean appointing someone to the head of the DEA that says marijuana is worse than heroin and meth?I'm curious exactly where your basis for ""he did as much as could be done without a backlash"" comes from given that he didn't just do nothing. He was only slightly more liberal than Chris Christie when it came to marijuana. He did nothing to help marijuana legalization. Sorry. That's the reality of it."

Yet a bunch of states have approved it for medical uses, signed off on by M.D.s. On what planet is this litmus test not acceptable? It's just common sense.We aren't even talking legalizing it, just removing it from schedule 1. That should be totally non-controversial."

Or maybe it was when they questioned his citizenship, his patriotism, his religion, and his legal right to be the President after winning a fucking election?The ""political realism"" of the Democratic party amounts to a suicide-pact, at this point, and basically, at ANY point after Bush stole the election in 2000."

dammudg,bexmex,"Either the attorney general or the head of the DEA could change the schedule of marijuana from 1, to 2 or 3. That would mean doctors could prescribe it like they do now for drugs like morphine. States could fully legalize it, but that would be slightly against federal law."
damoe65,BeastAP23,He could unilaterally reschedule it.
damf4sw,SultanObama,"While I would have loved for Obama to have fought for this, the political reality is that there is finite political capital to use. Obama clearly valued other areas to spend resources on. Personally I think it was better to wait and see the results of Colorado and Washington to use them as further credit for the cause. If he had fought for anything I doubt it would have been effective and it could have backfired with republicans in congress"
damlrgo,22254534,"Yep, it would be another issue that he did everything he could for with no results that people would hold against him.

dampg7g,Ammop,"Except he doesn't need congress for this, and hasn't needed to worry about reelection for 4 years.The term political capital is a bunch of crap too.

damxrsn,kojak488,"> Except he doesn't need congress for this,You sure about that?>On 20 May 2009, the United States Senate passed an amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2009 (H.R. 2346) by a 90–6 vote to block funds needed for the transfer or release of prisoners held at the Guantánamo Bay detention camp.Or there's:>On 7 January 2011, President Obama signed the 2011 Defense Authorization Bill which contains provisions that place restrictions on the transfer of Guantánamo prisoners to the mainland or to other foreign countries, thus impeding the closure of the detention facility. The bill prohibits the use of funds to ""modify or construct facilities in the United States to house detainees transferred from"" Guantánamo Bay.[291][292] He strongly objected to the clauses and stated that he would work with Congress to oppose the measures.Congress controls the budget and, odd as this may seem, it takes money to close down Guantanamo.And of course you can argue that he is closing down Gitmo. As of August 2016 there's some 61 remaining prisoners with 20 more cleared for transfer. There were some 242 at the start of his presidency. That's pretty good going by my books when Congress is giving you the middle finger the entire time."

damxksu,bigfinger76,True. Which makes it even more foolish to blow your capital there.
dan6g46,SashimiJones,"On the other hand, it's maybe a great move to get Republicans up in arms about a gun bill while allowing legalization to move forward quietly.

dan7oy5,SashimiJones,"It's pretty apparent that was Obama's strategy over the last few years, actually.

Any stance that Obama takes is going to invite a backlash from the right and they'll do anything to block it. Just look at how impossible they made it for him to shut down Guantanamo. So unless there are real advantages to publicly picking a side often times his best strategy is for him to say nothing on a topic that's already very quickly sorting itself out."
dampe35,,Pot is still illegal on a federal level. He has the authority to shut it all down before it even started. Other presidents would.
dan7j12,BabyMakingMachine,Other presidents have been white. It would only enforce stereotyping towards African Americans even though Obama thinks it's a dumb issue - I mean the whole root of weed being illegal was that if you smoked it your white wife will cheat on you with a minority.

damnw8o,Chytilova,"Take a wild guess who hires the head of the DEA. If he really wanted he could have hired someone who was for legalization. He didn't. Just look at the appointments. Sure now he can't do shit, but he had plenty of time if he actually cared about this. He obviously doesn't."

Oh he supports it, but only after his loose-lipped VP comes out in favor of it first.

damivrs,SirEDCaLot,"Like direct the DEA to remove marijuana from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act. This is something that the DEA has administrative authority to do, without going through Congress. If Obama tells them to do it, they almost certainly will. He could then issue a blanket pardon that anyone convicted of simple possession of marijuana without intent to distribute is immediately pardoned. While no President that I'm aware of has ever issued such a broad pardon, it is within his Constitutional power to do it. He could then re-issue the same pardon order on his last day in office and that would pardon anybody convicted of marijuana possession between now and then. This wouldn't legalize weed, but it would be a very strong statement and would have broad popular support."

damrryl,NazzerDawk,"No, but we are talking about what he can do right now."
damlz5l,SirEDCaLot,"Well the head of the DEA could refuse to do it. Obama could then demand their resignation and/or fire them. At that point the second in command would I think become the acting DEA head, while a replacement head would have to go through Congressional confirmation (which WON'T happen before January). However the acting head could reschedule marijuana, and while it would likely be seen as improper for an acting agency head to make such a sweeping decision, it's still technically within their authority. So it's technically possible, but not terribly easy or without political consequence."

damuasx,SirEDCaLot,"It would be largely unprecedented and very controversial. It's commonly accepted as poor form to ram through radical and/or controversial policy during the lame-duck period, especially if your party just lost bigtime. No President has ever blanket pardoned tens of thousands of people, and demanding the DEA reschedule marijuana would be seemed as something the next president should do.I still think he should do it. But he probably won't because it would be hugely controversial and would cost the Democrats..."
damks0c,the_red_scimitar,"Might be good to know something about those laws before making rash statements about them. The ""law"" (i.e. statute itself) does not indicate which drugs are illegal. Well... the original 1970 law listed and classified (called the drugs ""schedule"") some, but ongoing, there is no law that needs to be changed. The Drug Enforcement Administration and the Food and Drug Administration, determine which substances are added to or removed from the various schedules. Both of these agencies are in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government, and thus under the command of the President.So, NO laws are needed to change the schedule of marijuana. Just the will by the President, to get this rolling. So, essentially, yes, he can order it reclassified, and since it DOES have well documented medical uses, the only reason it remains in Schedule 1 (the most illegal drugs) is political."
damnwpl,berrieh,His administration can reschedule marijuana. Then Trump's would have to decide if it's worth the political capital to change it back. They could. But they'd have to actually say they're going after MJ and not play both sides.

daml980,100percentpureOJ,"If Trump has no idea what he advocates then how can anybody on r/politics claim to know what he will do? Also, how is ""stop and frisk"" anti-second amendment?

damn37u,Blackmagician,"I think the article is reaching as well but the logic is somewhat there. If police are stopping people solely on the basis of confiscating weapons then legal gun owners would be effected by these stops. Doing it just because they're black highlights the hypocrisy of this. In a white gun area the NRA and it's supporters would go nuts if officers were constantly checking people to determine whether their firearms were legal or not. Confiscation isn't the issue, being unfairly targeted in the first place is."
damnctr,100percentpureOJ,If you're walking down the street with a concealed firearm it is not ridiculous to think that the police might want proof that you are carrying it legally. What is the point in even having gun laws if they are not enforced?
damo7t1,,"""Concealed""..... why would they need to stop and ask proof if they're not sure it exists in the first place?"
damobta,100percentpureOJ,So why even have concealed carry laws if anyone can just walk around with a concealed weapon with no consequences? If you can't enforce the laws there is no point in them existing.
damoy7i,,"How are they not enforceable? It's definitely possible to earn a felony charge on top of a misdemeanor. If someones get searched because a cop saw them steal a bag a chips, and they have a firearm without proper licensing. Its going to be a bad day."
damp5wd,100percentpureOJ,> If someones get searched because a cop saw them steal a bag a chipsSo we have to wait for them to commit another crime in order to catch them carrying a concealed weapon illegally?
dampcnr,Blackmagician,Yes. Again I will ask do you think normal responsible gun owners want to be frequently searched by the police to determine if their concealed carry is legal or not? Do you want to be unduly searched by the police as you go about your day to day? I think you lack understanding of what enforcement and stop and frisk actually is.
dampl6p,100percentpureOJ,"I'm not trying to advocate for stop and frisk, I just don't think stop and frisk is against the second amendment like the article is saying. That's the only point I'm trying to make."
damqfnj,Blackmagician,"It's against the second amendment in that it would infringe upon gun rights for owners. If it's legal to have a gun (open carry is legal in 44 states I believe) then you should not be searched simply for having something that is legal. Simply possessing a legal firearm, concealed or open carry is not a license to be targeted by the police(which is what stop and frisk is). There are extremes like the people who walk around with rifles to the park or other public places(which is also legal but understandable people would call the police and actually makes the stop constitutional) but for the most part simply having a gun should not subject you to being searched by the police."
damp63n,Blackmagician,"Like your other post you're mistaking ability to enforce laws with removing people's constitutional rights. Nothing is stopping the police from enforcing the law, but we're not going to make suspected criminals out of people just because of their race or the fact that they own a gun."
damp9c9,100percentpureOJ,How can you enforce concealed carry laws constitutionally? That is what I am wondering.
dampjey,Blackmagician,"I think they're doing it very well right now in plenty of states and the NRA is a strong lobby on behalf of it's members. Only search people when you have a credible reason to or suspect criminal activity. The thing about stop and frisk is that it wasn't about reasonable suspicion, it was just a wide net and we see statistically that it doesn't work. They got away with it in nyc because it was in poorer minority communities."
damozg6,Blackmagician,"In concealed or open carry states do you think the police normally go around frisking tons of people with little to no cause just to determine if their firearm is legal or not? The answer is no. I think what a lot of people still fail to understand about the Nyc implementation of stop and frisk is that it was a crap shoot. People have this vision that the police were doing targeted and accurate stops that made a dent when it was the exact opposite of that. Guns were found one tenth of one percent out of millions of stops. It didn't work and all they were doing was antagonizing the community(black/latino) at large for little to no results. When laws are ""enforced"" by shooting a shotgun into the ocean and hoping it hits it's unconstitutional."

damgmze,Psycho_historian_8,I originally thought he was leaving this layup for Clinton so she could start her admin off with a bang. Now I'm thinking Obama's parting shots are going to be a big deal. Hopefully something with marijuana and a mass commutation of prisoners that were screwed in the Drug War. If he's really feeling himself (and it's possible) maybe a recess appointment of Judge Garland? Don't know the feasibility of that one though.
damgryh,TheGoddamnShrike,"I can't decide if that's the right move or not. I don't think Sessions is going to leave it alone but I think the odds are even lower if Obama takes some last minute action on it.

But -- that's *probably* going to happen anyway, so I just dunno."
damnbff,Koopa_Troop,>they're a lot more likely to undo it and crackdown I think.I agree but I think that's the point. It forces Sessions and Trump to take a very unpopular position at the very start of their administration and spend a lot of political capital on it. The backlash would be huge.

Invasion of privacy is worse than ever. He went back into Iraq, after the agreement signed by Bush had pulled everyone out prior to 2012. He pushed unnecessarily secretive ""trade deals"" (much of which was copyright law, privacy law, etc.). He ran the least transparent administration in history. He keeps saying ""weed is okay"" but does nothing beyond empty talk--the man won't even push to federally deregulate and let states decide. Didn't come down hard on the banks who had screwed the ""average american""; no prosecutions came out of that (though he'll force reexaminations of municipal level shootings). His health care bill was DOA from its first draft when it relied on states and private companies opting in, with no effort to control the costs of services.

Republicans also criticized him for pulling out of Iraq, you seem to be rewriting history here. The ""Pivot to Asia"", which included the TPP negotiations, deserves an entire thread all its own. Republicans were willing to shut down the government over raising the debt ceiling, there's no way they'd have allowed any sort of deregulation to go through. He did push for financial regulations, although you can certainly argue they should have pushed harder, but he wanted to save energy to fight for healthcare reform.Energy policy is another area where he pushed for renewables and opposed coal mining while still allowing oil drilling, and then got heavily criticized by Republicans despite the fact that oil production is at an all time high.

As an example of how difficult it was for Obama, conservatives still criticize Obama as being horribly racially divisive even though he didn't take any action on race issues.

dan0ee6,karl4319,"In 2009, the Democrats controlled congress. They were one seat short of a super majority in the senate. If, **IF**, the democrats pushed through bills that ended gerrymandering, allowing felons to vote, and forced automatic voter registration (citing the 14th amendment to do these things), I have no doubt that by 2012 they would have had the necessary seats in congress to actually push such an amendment. Call me crazy, but in 2009, it could have happened if he actually pushed for it."
dan57wu,CrazyCatLady108,"you know what the majority was busy doing at the time? the ACA. which i think is a pretty damn big deal. and while i would have loved to have all those things you listed ACA was big, and if you don't think it was look at the republican response to it."

dankikr,karl4319,"The ACA was an awful decision. Yes it made insurance more affordable to some people (depending on the state government) and I love that insurance no longer can be denied for preexisting conditions. But forcing people to buy health insurance (which is constantly getting more expensive) or pay a fine is ridiculous. Worse yet, despite the fact that they had a majority in both the house and senante, the still compromised and gutted the single payor option. But because it's called Obamacare, it will be the first target for the now republican controlled congress and Trump. The choice to tackle healthcare first and make it his legacy turned out to be a mistake. Now it looks like the only good legacy Obama will leave is that he was black."
daor08v,CrazyCatLady108,"> But forcing people to buy health insurance (which is constantly getting more expensive) or pay a fine is ridiculous.there is no other way to ensure that healthy people would sign up for insurance. you need healthy people in the pool to make coverage affordable for sick people. because too many healthy people chose to pay the fine, and because the single payer option was cut, the premiums are rising. the single payer was a sacrifice made to the RNC in hopes to keep them satisfied. Dems miscalculated, because nothing is going to keep the people who think equality = subjugation from losing their shit. they miscalculated thinking that if them went all out, way too much shit hit the fan. a whole lot of shit hit the fan, regardless."
dan746q,voldin91,Maybe in 2012

Instead of healthcare, he should have pushed for extending the democrat's base by allow felons to vote, pushed for automatic voter registration, and ended gerrymandering. Then I believe, if the effort was made in 2010, maybe 2012, the democrats would have had the states or congressional seats needed for such an amendment."
danucvm,voldin91,He probably wouldn't have been reelected if he did anything too extreme
danxn4l,karl4319,"If he radically expanded the base (which automatic voter registration and allowing felons to vote would do), then he would have been reelected. As it stands, lower turnout from millennials, who were no longer mystified by him, cost Obama North Carolina in 2012. Plus voter suppression efforts made the race much closer in several states like Pennsylvania. If he focused on greater voter turnout and went after politicians trying to suppress voters in '09, we wouldn't have Trump now. Of course, we would have barely any corporatist democrats too which is why he didn't."
damno8i,,"It wasn't pushing for equality for minorities it was the left calling every white male a racist, sexist asshole. There is a huge difference in the two. Obama cant muster up the balls to push marijuana legalization but he can have his AG look for hate crimes in the death of Trayvon Martin and make speeches that cause a divide in the country. Before we get into the Trayvon Martin case my personal stance is he was a thug and Zimmerman was an overzealous asshole, this was two assholes getting into a fight. The president had no business getting everyone riled up, there are much more legitimate issues he could have hit before even touching that one."
damp2cn,get_it_together1,Thanks for proving my point.

Obama being almost completely silent about the main historical source of establishment control of minority populations is really fucking outrageous. I hope it will be remembered!
damz150,karl4319,"Obama's ultimate legacy: he was black and a wimp. We could have had universal healthcare or at least a public option, instead we have the ACA. He could have ended the drug war, instead he increased it. He could have called the bluff of the government shutdowns and actually used the 14th amendment. Hell, he could have pushed for automatic voter registration or ending the electoral college (both of which could have prevented Trump).

damztwi,LaWu,This is so true. So many in law enforcement have the worst fucking views on drugs because they only deal with the shittiest people.
dan2gzo,jabbadarth,I think it goes both ways. Some get harder shells and dehumanize the problem and some get softer and realize there are people behind these addictions. I think it skews towards hardening but there are some softies out there just trying to help people.

dan22mn,jabbadarth,"I think that is unfair and a bit of a generalization. I have not met a DEA agent, that I am aware of but I do know a few cops and know that they are all drastically different in their views and opinions just from each other so I can only imagine DEA agents would be the same just like any of us. I can't imagine that of the 5000 or so agents in the DEA there aren't at least a few that would be happy to stop arresting people for weed and start focusing on helping people with drug problems instead of just arresting them."
dammnzg,Spencersknow,"Seriously, no, the DEA is as bad as any criminal enterprise. They steal from Americans and they are subsidized to do it. Let local law enforcement handle drug laws and let the FDA determine safety of drugs. Not cops that are generally very misinformed on drug subject matter. The DEA has the ability to form policy and that's not OK. Scientists and doctors should determine drug safety. The DEA takes people's assets without conviction, and attacks legal business enterprise. Like the TSA they are truly worthless. Federally subsidize local departments for drug law enforcement and end the drug war. The dea is now obsolete."

Though some of those assumptions were confirmed, it must be considered that the man is very pragmatic and it's likely that many things he failed to do is simply because he felt the time wasn't right.

damu151,Unconfidence,"Only in the presidential election. And why would that be the case? States aren't entities deserving of rights like individuals are. If 3-4 states draw the majority of the population *now*, when travel between states has never been easier, then isn't that a sign of the ""laboratories of democracy"" doing their job, and the states with more well-liked policies drawing more people? Why should we slight *people* so we can feel like we aren't slighting *areas*? And especially, why in an election for a representative of *all of us*? The states have senators, they have filibuster power. Wyoming citizens shouldn't get more of a say in an election for my representative than I do."

The outrage over this election just goes to show how completely ignorant many young people are as to the size and scope of the history of American politics. There are going to be winners that we hate, and losers that we cry for. That has always been the case, and always will be.

damiwjz,goldman105,It was way easier to get cigarettes or alcohol than weed when I was in school. Those ghetto cornerstones just want buissines.
dammqde,Farfignougat,where do I go to buy weed
dammv9h,Whit3W0lf,"Nice try, DEA. Maybe try /r/marijuanaenthusiasts?"
damnj9e,Blakesabb,I'm more of an r/trees kinda guy
damnp0e,Whit3W0lf,"""lose my number"" -/u/Blakesabb dealer, probably."
damq16n,ClearSearchHistory,"Are you in high school? Find a stoner kid, say you're out of weed and ask where they buy. It would be ridiculously easy. But I don't smoke.."
damn1og,,[deleted]
damn99g,Whit3W0lf,Im in my 30s and still get carded 99% of the time and I have visible tattoos; I dont look underage. Maybe its geographical? The BATFE is pretty hard on businesses here in Florida. They are constantly testing businesses to see if they sell to minors.
damny4w,jmg83,"I didn't have a fake ID at 15, but I did have a 14 year old female friend who'd get served booze in the local offy on account of the fact that she was exceptionally...gifted for a girl her age. Plus it was the 90s, and no one really gave much of a fuck, anyway."
dampw1p,ClearSearchHistory,"Currently in high school. People will almost go out of their way to get you weed, alcohol is kind of a bitch to get a hold of. Literally mention smoking and needing more, and people will offer you dealers."
damx57o,flounder19,"For parties, yes. But for personal use, alcohol was the only one that was available without leaving my home."
damgbvx,Sha_of_Depression,"No, I'm saying weed was rampant in use."
damgumz,Whit3W0lf,It just needs to be regulated like cigarettes and alcohol. End of story. No more locking up people for shit that really doesnt matter at the tax payers expense.
damizeq,googleitduh,Your drug dealer can sell you tobacco and alcohol
damkk92,Xelif,"Maybe not. Your high school drug dealer is probably a high schooler or just graduated. They have a seller for weed, but they may not have a seller for tobacco or alcohol - especially in places that take underage sales seriously."
damlcgp,wankerbot,What a time to be alive!
damksij,HiltonSouth,Depends which gas station.
dammwve,isubird33,"Way harder. To get weed in high school you had to know someone who dealt, or knew someone with the hookup. Alcohol....everyone had the one friend who had an older sibling or parent who would buy for them. Or knew the kid who's parents kept a stocked liquor cabinet and look the other way."
damneel,FormerlyGruntled,"When I was a kid, I was straight laced. Now that I'm in my mid-30s, with the time and emotional maturity to make the choices, I don't even know how I'd get drugs. And with how shit life has been lately, I really wouldn't mind experimenting some, just to break the boredom."
damfdy7,AFineDayForScience,Do the same what with weed? Make it illegal for minors to purchase it? I was making an argument for legalization. I can't really even tell which side of this you're on at this point.
damf7td,BrainOil,But which ones are the hardest for them to get? Probably the ones that are only sold in stores that you need an I.D. for by a mile. I know which one was easiest to find when I was in high school and my dad was even an alcoholic.
damfvmc,CaptainPoopbeard,He probably wasn't a very good one then.
damg02q,BrainOil,"Was and still is a pretty decent drunk. He was also crazy violent, I'd never chance it."
damjgwb,CaptainPoopbeard,Did he ever win a fight with a full maternity ward? Because that's the real metric.
damfyjl,MaximumEffort433,">They still do the same with weed. As a stoner, and a responsible adult, I've got to say that one of the most reassuring things to me has been seeing how Washington and Colorado have pursued pretty damn common sense regulations around who, what, when, and where someone can imbibe. People give me shit for this, but I don't want someone to smoke up and go for a drive (*just like* I don't want them to get drunk and drive, or spun, or rolling, or tripping, or blown) and knowing that the states are watching out for that really does reassure me. For years my fellow smokers have been saying ""It's easier for a kid to buy an eighth from his dealer than to pick up a 40oz. from the liquor store."" It's good to see that trend starting to change."
damwf38,gophergun,"You should see the new social use initiative in Denver. Common sense regulations everywhere. Can't have odor complaints, can't be visible to the public right of way, you need a permit from community organizations and it has to be closed off to people under 21. Plus, pot smokers would still be bound by the state's Clean Indoor Air act, so you could only use edibles and vaporizers indoors. Personally, I think it's pretty fascinating."

dammt4h,ABSTRVCTedits,Cigarettes and alcohol are far more dangerous to minors. Don't even try this dumb argument.
damn06e,RollTide09,It depends really. It's a lot more dangerous to drive while high (especially for the inexperienced smokers) than to drive after smoking a cigarette.
dampmkg,ABSTRVCTedits,"Driving while stoned for inexperienced users is one of the only dangers I can think of. I would also say weed is a gateway drug for some, but not at all to the same extent of its reputation conjured up by DARE and other shit. Cigarettes certainly are a gateway drug as well, a lot of high schoolers and college students I know who constantly smoke cigs are the ones who started using OCs, percs, coke, and other drugs. Not to mention the long term damage cigarettes cause and the fact that taxpayers have to pay for those who can't pay their medical bills. As for alcohol...alcoholism is one of the scariest addictions people and families go through. It's also easy and common to overdose. Calling it alcohol poisoning is normalizing the effects of overdosing."
dampwn0,RollTide09,I agree.
damexad,watchout5,"Washington checking in. Our numbers are down, and the numbers in states where it's illegal have more kids using marijuana. Your states that keep it illegal are terrible and should feel bad."
damf5ec,Elmobius,"If its legal, mom and dad are more likely to do it, which makes it uncool."
damkbm9,CraftyFellow_,That and illegal dealers don't check for ID.
damwbeg,tehlemmings,And the ones who want to make real money dealing go for the adults who have money lol
damlv83,Narventurer,But also gives the lil' kiddos a contact high!
damm3to,SpottyNoonerism,"Another WA resident here and, yeah, that's been my theory. Parents get high, kids see how goofy they act and decide that they'd rather just play video games or shoot heroin or anything other than cannabis."
damnxej,JuventusX,Man smoking with my parents would be chill as fuck. Might repair our relationship too...
damo2h8,berrieh,Plus dispensaries put dealers out of business (I imagine many sell other shit). And kids can't buy from dispensaries without ID.
dan03x3,mgman640,">(I imagine many sell other shit).Such as edibles, oils, and various different paraphernalia used to smoke it. Why make a shitty bong out of a bottle and some tape when you can just buy a nice glass one easily and legally, in the same exact place you get your weed?"
danczjc,warsie,cost? doesnt legalization drive up prices which means illegal dealers can still be popular in places as legal stuff is too expensive
damq3t8,plowerfower,I'm ury
dami5ia,Juicebox_7,Exactly. It's harder for minors to get it when it's legalized and regulated.
dammw8d,jdenst,The point that should always be made. It was harder to get alcohol than weed in high school. *A lot* harder in fact.
damq5rl,,"My dad agrees with this statement, yet still thinks more kids are getting their hands on it since it's been legal (we're in CO). Yet he can't find any sources to back it up, when all studies have shown minors' use of the drug has either gone down or remained the same."
damv8pj,BecauseFeelz,"He may not be wrong. It's very difficult to get actual, true numbers related to teen drug use. They've been indoctrinated with ""drugs are bad, m'kay?"" I can remember 9th grade, one of the few ""stoners"" in school, and getting those surveys. As anonymous as they said they were, no one in their right mind would write that they have or do smoke pot.Marijuana use has been incredibly praised by millenial culture. Rap wasn't as mainstream, and mainstream rap wasn't all about smoking weed to be cool. They were there, but it wasn't the way it's on social media now with Wiz Khalifa, or every rapper talking about blunts and shit (yes, Biggie & Pac existed, but they were pioneers). Point is, I think more kids are comfortable trying weed with the increase in popularity in mass media."
dan2tht,,Lol yeah they say those tests are anonymous....I tested it once and put that I did pretty much everything on a regular basis and got pulled aside by the teacher because she peeked.
damwio2,amyourwhite,"I agree, if i wanted alcohol i would need a fake ID or an 'of age' friend who was willing to buy me alcohol, but if i wanted weed, i needed a dealer and some cash"
damzlxm,Neglectful_Stranger,Not for me. We had this Pakistani clerk at the local gas station right beside the school who would sell us booze and cigarettes even though we clearly walked in from the school.
dandhi0,ChilliHat,"As an Australian, it was the complete opposite for me. Though thats probably because the legal drinking age is 18 so seniors can purchase alcohol fairly often."
damtl9j,141414187DRILL,When I was in school it was way easier to get hard drugs than to shoulder tap for beers.
dampwvi,Pre-Owned-Car,It was always easier for me to get weed when I was like 16. I had a dozen dealers in my phone but my options for getting alcohol were hoping I didn't get id'd or that a stranger would be cool and buy me some.
damid88,MC_Fap_Commander,"It's like Black Friday. Legalization happens... ""woo-hoo! weed parties everywhere!"" for a few days. A couple months later, ""yeah, I've gotta paint the garage then take the kids to soccer practice and it's looking like an early morning at work tomorrow... when things calm down in a few weeks, maybe we can get together to smoke."""
dammucj,cmlondon13,"This. Adults who smoke weed don't stop being adults. Though, to be honest, if I had an early day in the morning, I probably would have a bowl before bed, to help me knock out (especially if I was sore from painting the garage, and the kids were getting on my nerves). But yeah, I wouldn't be getting ripped with my buddies on a day like that. Grownups gotta plan that kinda thing. And the great thing about weed is that you can smoke it one day, not smoke for two weeks, and have absolutely no ill effects, withdrawal, etc."
damodhg,thoggins,"I've read that smoking before bed can actually have a negative impact, actually, by way of suppressing REM cycles. I don't have a source but I was interested to see it, as I'm aware that it's common to use a small quantity as a sleep aid.I'm pro legalization; this was just an interesting thing i saw somewhere."
dampgx0,cmlondon13,"Yeah, I know what you're talking about; I'm pretty sure I've read something similar, though it was put into the context of ""people who quit smoking regularly have some pretty vivid dreams"". I can tell you from recent experience that this is true."
damydj2,Ironhorse86,"I do however use it to stop me from dreaming, and certain strains work wonderfully for that."
dan47d5,thoggins,"Well, that meshes. Dreams are products of REM cycles, so if smoking does suppress REM, it would produce dreamless sleep. I guess there are certain strains that do this more than others? Interesting."
dan0shf,LaWu,I believe (read: think I saw somewhere) that only happens to chronic (no pun intended) users.
dan4atd,thoggins,"Yeah, I can believe that. It might have been in the article (blog post? who knows what it was) I saw about it, even; there's every chance I never read more than the title. This is reddit, after all. So many things have side effects that only manifest in force when they're used excessively or chronically."
damg8xg,greentreesbreezy,If it's legalized and regulated by the government the rate of use by minors will decrease.
damgwm9,Besuh,I'm not saying it won't happen but whats your logic?Minors smoking now is illegal. How does keeping it illegal for minors change the amount they smoke?
damhuws,greentreesbreezy,Legalization means that dealers no longer have complete control over that market.Think about Alcohol Prohibition. More people drank while it was illegal than when it was legal. And it actually gave criminal organizations a drug around which they could base their business and control neighborhoods.If you make something legal you actually remove a source of profit from criminal organizations.
dami5az,Besuh,"""We find that alcohol consumption fell sharply at the beginning of Prohibition, to approximately 30 percent of its pre-Prohibition level. During the next several years, however, alcohol consumption increased sharply, to about 60-70 percent of its pre-prohibition level""http://www.nber.org/papers/w3675Seems like prohibition resulted in 30% less drinking."
damn29b,,it also had the extra benefit of making all consumers criminal and increasing organized crime by 100000000000000000000000000000% yay
damnd49,Besuh,I'm not defending prohibition. and I'm pro legalization of Marijuana. But yea lots of people got rich off of prohibition.
dan0uqa,LaWu,Would you fess up to drinking in a survey while it was illegal? Same thing here. Teen use right now is WAY higher than reported. It would fall if dealers weren't literally in the schools.
dami7nz,Juicebox_7,"This is purely anecdotal, so I guess it doesn't matter too much, but it was always much harder as a minor to get alcohol/cigarettes."
damic93,Besuh,"eh? My experience is it is easier to get cigs and alcohol than weed. Ask your older brother, snatch it from your parents. I think Alc and Cigs are actually much more common in minors than weed."
damiht6,Juicebox_7,I guess it mostly just depends on who you know. It was always hard for me and my friends to find people to buy us stuff.
damj4d9,Besuh,yea I guess. If you knew a weed dealer but not an older person it'd be easier to get weed. But I imagine older people (willing to buy for you) are more common than weed dealers.
dan0x3n,LaWu,"I don't know where you guys live, but down here, no parents were giving shit to anyone. Most didn't drink and the ones that did are alcoholics and had all the stupid tricks to know if even a drop was gone. So, no, it hasn't been in my experience that parents are the main suppliers."
damr0rt,,[removed]
damrhv2,Besuh,"Okay so I knew how to get weed in Highschool I knew people with everything. But I also think it was super easy to get alcohol. I imagine cigarettes too but it wasn't really that popular.I honestly think pot heads think it's easy to get weed cause they get it all the time. But Kids who liked alcohol enough would have just as easy if not an easier time to get alcohol. No offense but I don't think highschool kids actually like alcohol unlike weed. Also it's hard to have occasions to get drunk, unlike getting high. saw many high kids at school, rarely any drunk ones. And our school I doubt anyone could not get alc if they wanted it"

damly5w,Torock_,"They're talking in response to the comment saying ""except it's far less dangerous than both"" which is advocating being more lax"
damr7uq,xwtt,"No, those two things aren't mutually exclusive. Marijuana *is* less dangerous than both but I don't think the rules should be more lax. They are all ""drugs"" to me. The exception being some kind of medical marijuana product being prescribed to a minor."
dameiih,ScienceBreathingDrgn,Agreed. But it's still far less dangerous than either Alcohol or Tobacco.
damf73w,SultanObama,"I don't smoke so forgive me. But how is it less dangerous than tobacco? Assuming you smoke it rather than edibles, wouldn't it have the same effects on the lungs and mouth?"

damm7bx,Why_You_Mad_,"Untrue. The tar comes from combustion of carbon-based material, the plant itself. Burning cannabis will cause tar buildup as well, it's just that you don't smoke weed like you do cigarettes (at least most wouldn't). If you smoked a joint a day, you'd have about the same tar in your lungs as someone who smoked a single cigarette a day."
damm08c,thegillenator,"Smoking anything creates tar, numskull"
damkrfp,linguotgr,"That's not true... tar isn't added to tobacco in cigarettes. It's actually just the common name for ""resinous"", which is the partially combusted remains of burning plant matter, like a tobacco leaf. MJ would have this also. In fact the two are pretty similar in tar levels. Many people think cigarette tar is like tar you see on a driveway or road. That's not true. Two completely different things with the same name."

damm63o,ScienceBreathingDrgn,"As others said, you smoke a much smaller volume.Consider a pack a day smoker of cigarettes, vs. a daily marijuana smoker, who maybe smokes the equivalent of, maybe five?The other things is there are less carcinogens (specific, cancer causing agents) in marijuana smoke.

damriti,bronerkill,"Unless you're snoop, not many people smoke as many joints a day vs the amount the average cigarette smoker smokes.

dan0zl5,Laidoutrivi63,"Not addressing the chemical composition of either drug, the frequency of smoking cigarettes compared to marijuana is much higher.

Even heavy smokers of pot likely smoke much less than tobacco users, which I would assume leads to less lung damage."
dan42vb,farting_moose,"Think about all the different chemicals in tobacco.Also, think about the amount of marijuana smoked vs tobacco for an average user. The average marijuana smoker isn't going to consume 10-20 joints per day."

damli67,TheDarkJester,"Marijuana in minors has also been shown to cause or exacerbate mental issues. Some studies have shown that it increases the likelihood of schizophrenia manifestation.

Would be more complicated if I had to get somebody to go to the store to get it like I do with alcohol and tobacco.

And you really weaken the pro-legalization argument if you try to take that route.You're talking about a fairly potent psychoactive substance that does have well recognized health risks (negative effects on neurological development if taken at younger ages, significant risk of developing/exacerbating schizophrenia, the normal health risks that come with inhaling combusted materials etc).More importantly, while the effects of being high are often desirable in social situations (whether with others or just while relaxing etc), they're equally negative in situations that carry some weight of personal responsibility (work, driving etc). The fact that the majority of consumption is via smoking means that use in public situations affects people around you, usually without their consent. The fact that passive exposure to this smoke is also psychoactive is a big deal as well.I'm pro-legalization, but if you want to be able to make a good argument for legalizing marijuana, you have to be able to show that you also recognize that there are negative aspects, and that you support legalization in a way that addresses these aspects. The model that most countries use for cigarettes and alcohol (more cigarettes, as alcohol licences are more location based) is a good model for the legalization of marijuana; particularly if you include things like not smoking within x number of meters of an entrance to a bar/restaurant, not smoking inside unless it's a private premises etc."

damfp6m,MaximumEffort433,"> But legal weed is one of my issues that I care about quite a bit so makes sense that I'm a bit more touchy about it, ya know?It bears remembering just how much progress has been made in the past eight years towards legalization.

To the best of my knowledge no major party nominee has ever taken such a progressive stance on cannabis as she did, and folks are still giving her shit for not going far enough. Legal weed, just like nearly all positive progress, is going to be a journey of ""Two steps forward, one step back"" until the dam breaks. The very important thing is to keep taking those two steps forward, and not to be disheartened by taking one step back. Imagine if African Americans had stopped fighting for civil rights because literacy tests blocked their votes, or if homosexuals had stopped fighting for marriage rights because of Prop 8, or if our fellow stoners had stopped fighting for full legalization because a few ballot initiatives failed.

It's a really basic freedom issue. If you believe in freedom whatever the fuck someone wants to do with their own lungs is their own problem.

damq7ts,Zoltrahn,"It takes away the choice to make it legal. That wouldn't be the choice anymore. The choice would then be to make it illegal again. Right now, Obama has left it to a state issue. So far it has been a great way to build support. Let the states that legalization has strong support go forward with it and set an example of how to handle it. If it was pushed onto states that weren't so supportive of legalization, there could be backlash and even harsher penalties for offenders. This was the same strategy gay marriage used and it worked amazingly well. Let states legalize it until there is overwhelming support. We are about to that tipping point. It sure isn't moving as fast as I or most would like it to, but major changes like this don't happen overnight."

damwgtn,WidespreadBTC,"Because the risk is fairly low and as a middle class white male with a professional job it's likely that I would have minimal punishment.

It is still a significant risk.If alcohol were illegal, people would still drink. By your logic you would ask ""why"" instead of realizing ""of course, that's how it works""."
damin5s,Magnesium18,">but the reality is weed isn't the most pressing issue nationwide and it doesn't make sense to expect any president to treat it that way.I think you need to do more research really. Would you say mass incarceration is not one of the most pressing issues? Would you say say racially biased arrests is not a pressing issue or would you say that the existing big pharma lobby and opiate pain killers are not a pressing issue? Currently due to the war on drugs, people and especially black people get arrested for possession of marijuana which is a non violent offence and can get large mandatory prison sentences. Lets also not forget how the prohibition of this substance is allowing money to go straight in the hands of drug cartels who then grow in influence only to peddle more dangerous drugs and further ruin this country when we could rather be using taxed marijuana to fund education. Marijuana which is a schedule 1 drug (really it should not be because it has medical utility) has resistance from the DEA because how else can they justify taking so much of the tax payers money (which otherwise would put many of them out of a job) when that can instead be diverted to rehab centres to make people actually better. Really it is not just a hippie movement or stoner movement trying to legalise marijuana but rather impacts and starts to address many issues progressives care about so please never call it smart again to curtail such a movement for progress simply because it saved a president from giving republicans ammunition. (Clearly it was not smart because even without this extra ammunition we now have president Trump and I would rather have a president Trump with a lot more liberal policies already enacted)"

I am neither agreeing nor disagreeing with what you have said because it is irrelevant. If there is a problem, and mass incarceration for minor drug offences is one (especially a drug as harmless to society in terms of violent conduct as marijuana), then it must be addressed no matter how you view the demography of the people who are fighting for this issue.>anything else would have set off a conservative moral panicWe live in a world where a man publicly endorsed by an ex grand wizard of the KKK has made it to the presidency of the US while deriding muslims (even the parents of war heroes) and mexicans so it would be safe to say that a conservative moral panic has already set in to alarming levels. Also do you know how the states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, North Dakota, and Arkansas are connected?

Hillary was the head of the committee in charge of working out the details of the new system, and she was attacked relentlessly by people in the HMO and pharmaceutical industries, not to mention by short-sighted republican fucks. They successfully exploited the pathetic aversion Americans seem to have to the idea of paying for the healthcare of others, and the whole healthcare reform initiative was dead by 1994. Even though public support for healthcare reform was high, no high profile politician truly fought for it for another 15 years. And as we've seen with this year's godawful election, the American public as a whole are no more rational or informed than they were in 1993."
damqmql,CireArodum,Obama and the Dems went hard with Obamacare and got a shellacking for their efforts. This is recent history.
danc76h,butsicle,They didn't even propose single payer. Obama didn't go hard at all. He got rekt in the midterms because his unwillingness to fight depressed the turnout of his base.
danh6ev,CireArodum,"Are you kidding? All the rhetoric coming from the right was how Obama was shoving this down our throats, and tyrannical government putting government death panels between you and your doctor. The debate dragged on for eon with the bill as it was. It would not have passed at all with single prayer. Insisting on single payer wouldn't have been going hard, it would have been going against a brick wall."
dao2r8c,butsicle,"Yeah, and all the democrats had to do was call out that blatant lie and also mention that they would save 45,000 lives every year. They may have not gotten single payer, but if they tried for it and fought for it they could have definitely gotten the public option. ""The republicans have so little faith in the current system they don't even think it will be able to compete with a public option. If I'm tyrannical by thinking the people of America should be able to have an option, then what would you label the people trying to limit your options and kill 45,000 people every year who can't afford basic healthcare? This is a basic human necessity. The Republicans would like to keep that for them and their families, but they believe that if you can't afford it that you actually deserve to die."" Unless he was campaigning he never played politics and went on the attack. It was all about reaching across the isle (giving the Republicans everything they want). When he went on the attack, he won. When he went on the defense he couldn't even control the Blue Dogs in his own party. He chose the losing strategy because his donors pay him to lose."
dan16m5,Anonymonynonymous,"Because the ""valid"" reasons for outlawing pot have been revealed to all be as substantial as smoke. And thousands of americans are currently spending years and years of their lives in jail over this. When you've been bitten by a cobra and you need to go to the hospital, you don't *wait.*"
damj47y,DeMarcoFurry,If he did do it you would not disagree.
damj7ms,shhhhquiet,"What is that even supposed to mean? If he did it, and it set off a moral panic, and led to an earlier and more decisive conservative takeover, yeah, I would look back and say 'probably should have been more temperate about that.'"
damppp2,DeMarcoFurry,"I mean you say that, but when has public opinion held Obama accountable for anything he's done?"
damjbca,slinkymaster,"Tell that to the people going to jail for non-violent drug offenses, which happens to be the #1 occupant of our jails. Destroys families, destroys careers and future economic prospects, but somehow not worth the political capital, which he saved for what exactly?"
damohoo,butsicle,"You make a great point and the 'political capital' argument is ridiculous, but credit where credit is due, he has broken records with the number of non-violent drug offenders he has released."
damjplx,,"He didn't find it worth it to spend political capital to keep more black kids out of prison? (60% of people in prison for drug offenses are minorities)He didn't find it worth spending political capital in more than halving the amount of people behind bars in America (which already has the largest rate of incarceration in the world)? source: [Police arrest more people for marijuana use than for all violent crimes combined](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/10/12/police-arrest-more-people-for-marijuana-use-than-for-all-violent-crimes-combined/?utm_term=.d38c5be3172f)He didn't find it worth restoring people's faith in the government / law enforcement by decriminalizing something that almost everyone did at least once, including our presidents?He didn't find it worth gutting the income of violent criminal gangs both in the US and Mexico? Saving hundreds of thousands of lives in this continent alone? Serving as a beacon to the world to decriminalize it everywhere?Sure, it's *possible* that he didn't think all that was important. But if that's true, then what kind of president is he?"
damo0ju,aFeniix,Idk my daughter with epilepsy would've liked it 10 years ago not in the next 5 lol.
dan13gi,Anonymonynonymous,Except thousands of people are losing decades of life being jailed for pot literally right now.
dan54m3,snafudud,"Love how Democratic presidents have such precious, limited political capital to spend that they hardly ever use it. Donald Trump and most modern Republican presidents don't give a fuck, spend their political capital, and then take out a massive political captial loan, declare bankruptcy, then take another loan.Obama is going to be rich with all of the political capital he didn't use. Maybe that's good for his approval rating, but his scant spending is about to be completely dismantled."
damfbj6,watchout5,> but he didn't find it worth it to spend political capital on a sweeping changeThis is why Clinton lost so bad.
damfg7w,shhhhquiet,"No, Clinton lost narrowly in the electoral college while winning the popular vote by a large margin because a lot of ignorant people believed a lot of comforting lies. Not because of weed."
damglvv,watchout5,It's because both her and Obama aren't bold. They don't fight for the people. They grow fat and lazy on our dime.
damgval,shhhhquiet,"Jeeze. You need to get some perspective, and also learn how the government actually *works.* If Obama had done this in the first half of his first term in that tiny window when he wasn't completely obstructed by congress, republicans would have used it to create a moral panic that would have given them even more power even sooner. He did what he could and it would have continued if enough people had taken the responsibility of the vote seriously enough to actually learn about the issues they were voting on."
damh0v7,watchout5,"I'm planning to spend from now until forever voting for the kind of change and progress I want to see in the world, if the kind of change and progress I want to see in the world can't be moved my politics, I aim to drag it's ass kicking and screaming into the 21st century. Now I just need a leader to represent these views for me. I'm willing to be that leader."
dampide,butsicle,">republicans would have used it to create a moral panic that would have given them even more power even sooner.This is laughable. They're on the wrong side of public opinion. All the Democrats need to do is go out into the media and argue for what the public already believe. You might as well make the same argument for Obama's overtime orders and raising the minimum wage. You don't lose votes by pushing for popular policies. This mantra of 'you don't know how politics works, what you need to do is start the negotiations by compromising' is the exact line paraded by the Clinton folks during the primary. We tried the 'incrementalist' strategy for years, and lost almost all power, now it's time to try the 'actually fighting for issues that 60-90% of the population agree on' strategy."
damhe72,youthdecay,Part of Clinton's platform was to reschedule marijuana...
damhgzu,watchout5,"Ironically, from a technical perspective, her new schedule plan would have invalidated anything but medical marijuana. It, wasn't much to hope about."
damhsl1,youthdecay,Her attorney general pick would certainly have been far more progressive on the issue than Trump's however.
damhxhl,watchout5,No doubt. Jeff Sessions is the reason my home loan just failed. Fucking a.
damp4xd,butsicle,"Trump got less votes than Romney. She lost because she couldn't convince enough people to vote for her because she stood for 'incremental change', which people translate to 'little/no change'. Maybe if she actually rallied against TPP in the rust belt states instead of quietly saying her public position is against it while people close to her tell the media she will flip in office, then she could have won. Most people didn't buy Trump's snake oil, but most people also didn't give a fuck about Hillary's plastic message. ""Stronger together"" ""I'm with Her"". Not a single genuine, passionate policy proposal. That's a losing recipe. He's not saying weed is why she lost. He's saying that not passionately pushing for any real change is why she lost, and he's absolutely right."
damglxm,tookmyname,"Lol. I'm sure you've accomplished a lot, edgy Reddit stranger."
damgvwc,watchout5,I probably sell more weed than you have. Probably.
dampl7d,butsicle,"Yeah, if I were on your side of the argument, I'd probably focus on ad hominem attacks too."
damkwhk,Schmedes,"Is ""political capital"" the newest buzzword we're throwing around here? Like it's a finite resource that absolves anyone of inaction?"
damrmfj,Hubbell,What fucking capital? He has NO POLITICAL CAPITAL. Republicans obstructed him in lockstep on damn near every single thing he tried to do.
damem8o,AFineDayForScience,"could he have even done it without the support of Congress? Obama's passed a lot of executive orders, but I don't know if that one would fly. Plus it would open up the ""first time we elect a black guy and he legalizes weed"" argument."
dameqqu,LBJ20XX,"Does he need the support of congress to say ""I think weed should be legal.""? That's what I'm saying."
damf5vn,rguin,"In a sense, yes. He was already fighting congress tooth and nail on a multitude of issues; giving them another thing to bludgeon him with would not have helped his existing causes."
damvlc9,HrtSmrt,"Yup, as it stands now he's just open to the ""we elected a black guy and he's just like a white Republican"" argument."
damwvay,AFineDayForScience,"Not really fair to say considering he only had 2 years of unobstructed governing and he still managed to take the first steps toward universal health care. He's also probably one of the most well spoken Presidents in living memory. Although our last two Republican Presidents are famous for having the ""best words."" GW even managed to have a calendar of his most eloquent phrases."
damx8vc,HrtSmrt,"He legitimized and extended most G. W. Bush's policies, irradicated habeus corpus and legalized indefinite detention of American citizens, bombed more countries and raided more dispensaries. Obamacare is also a disaster if you haven't caught on yet btw, even Bill Clinton admits it. But you're right, he sure talked real nice."
damys9u,AFineDayForScience,"ugh, I should've stayed quiet. It's too late for a political argument, but here goes. He also passed the stimulus package that helped pull the economy out of the recession, in addition to the one which helped restore the American auto industry, bringing unemployment down from 10% to 5% and tripling the stock market. He repealed Don't ask Don't tell, reversed Bush's torture policies, raised fuel efficiency standards for automobiles, nominated the first Hispanic person to the Supreme Court, invested heavily in renewable energy, expanded stem cell research by removing Bush's restrictions, approved and monitored the operation that killed Osama Bin Laden, and yes he talked nice. You can talk about bombing countries, but neither you or I had the information he did when making those decisions. With groups like ISIS and Al-Qaeda that don't reside in strictly one country I think we were lucky that he was the one making decisions on who and when to bomb. Trump may just decide he doesn't like looking at Libya on a map."
damzjxh,HrtSmrt,"I would ague all he's done is set us up for a much worse recession very soon. Interests rates are at zero with talk of negative interest rates like Japan has implemented. The economy is incredibly inflated. But that's besides the point because all of it pales in comparison to the things I listed. And it's funny you mention Libya, another huge success, destroyed, metaphorically (literally is pretty unnecessary if DOES have oil after all) wiped off the map and now an ISIS haven. If he was a white Republican he'd be getting crucified by the same people singing his praises right now."
damdwyg,darwinn_69,"Actually, he needs congressional cooperation to decriminalize it at a federal level. If you're referring to the FDA scheduling it's by design not really influenced by the president. The best he can do is address enforcement and maybe relax some banking regulations to make it easier for these companies to do business."
damj8md,Eurynom0s,"> Actually, he needs congressional cooperation to decriminalize it at a federal level. False. The Controlled Substances Act delegates scheduling authority to the Attorney General. If marijuana were completely descheduled, it would become legal (in the same sense as alcohol being legal—state law could still ban it)."
damdzpc,LBJ20XX,He didn't need to wait 8 years to start the process. Fact of the matter is he didn't really do shit about legalizing it except to say feds won't go after the states where it is legal. Now on the way out he says it should be legal. Could have said that a long time ago.
damewwo,rguin,"> Fact of the matter is he didn't really do shit about legalizing it except to say feds won't go after the states where it is legal... which is still pretty huge because, under that rule, we went from 0 states with legalization passed to 8."
damf8tw,LBJ20XX,Talking medical or recreational?
damfchk,rguin,"Recreational. As of this past election day, we hit 8 states with legal marijuana (and that includes a couple east-coast states!)"
damfp1q,LBJ20XX,"WA state here. Won't lie, feels pretty damn good to be spearheading this effort. Now that we have the West Coast Weed Alliance I will say that even though Obama couldn't get anything done (and I'm switching from wouldn't to couldn't because yeah, would have been tough) I'm not too worried about the future of legal weed. I know Sessions has a history but I just don't think it's going to be a priority of this administration."
damg7rw,rguin,"Yeah I think it's a foregone conclusion at this point. Not that it's a *huge* set of data, but these 8 states--coupled with the states with medical--draw a strikingly similar map to the one one drawn by states with [legal gay marraige 'round 2013.](http://graphics.latimes.com/usmap-gay-marriage-chronology/) Granted, that change was ultimately brought about by a SCOTUS ruling, but just look at the *utter* landslide effect that starts around October 2014.I'd wager that once California starts reporting outright stupid amounts of revenue from it (because, let's face it, CA has been *the* pot state in the mind of the nation since *long* before CO, WA, or OR legalized), and Massachusetts and Maine start reporting similarly stupid numbers due to canna-tourism, it'll be a matter of *months* before other states start saying ""fuck me we gotta get that money!""My money's on the majority of states having legal marijuana by 2020."
damppu7,butsicle,That wasn't because of Obama's watered-down policy. It's because public opinion overwhelmingly favours change.
damefvk,,"Yes, because saying weed should be legal will definitely get Republicans to support him, and not the opposite. There is no better way to get congress to oppose an issue than to have Obama come out in favor of it."
damexq8,DickinBimbos,"He never got Republicans support on anything, he wa the one who always compromised. Cowardly Barack."
damraj0,deelowe,Scheduling is handled by the DEA and he can instruct them to reschedule Marijuana. This is something he's in direct control over. Same goes for pardons of offenders.
damea3a,,"Yes, because Obama totally could have gotten Republicans who control congress to pass a bill decriminalizing it. https://i.redd.it/g4n2a5rwxs0y.png"
damftpo,ILikeLenexa,The AG and HHS (FDA) can administratively legalize marijuana.[This article has a nice flow chart](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2015/02/13/how-to-reschedule-marijuana-and-why-its-unlikely-anytime-soon/)
damg6ep,,WRONG! The DEA has the final say.
dampe20,CannedBread5eva,Now I don't know who to believe
damr97b,Terex,So the Brooking institute is wrong? ok...
dameido,brjoyce44,"He doesn't have to pass a bill, just get his Drug Czar to reschedule it"
damfkpz,Sevigor,"This exactly. It's really only illegal because it's a scheduled drug. Remove it from controlled substances, and you're golden. That he does have the power to do."
damfky9,,"The Drug Czar doesn't schedule drugs. The DEA does. Unfortunately, the Senate won't confirm any of his appointments to head the DEA."
damgk8q,CrustyGrundle,"The guy Obama appointed to head the DEA last year called medicinal marijuana a joke, so forgive me if I find it unlikely that obama actually cares about rescheduling marijuana."
damgq06,,"Technically he wasn't appointed, since the senate refuses to confirm any of his appointments. But still, Obama definitely should have been more willing to stir the pot and appoint democrats. Look how Comey turned out."
damsi9e,CrustyGrundle,"Right, he was nominated and is currently acting head of the DEA. Have to wonder why Obama nominates guys like that to the head of the DEA, the one agency responsible for marijuana classification, if he really thinks it should be regulated like cigarettes or alcohol. Seems like he has been openly pro-legalization all along, but then he does things like that. Makes you wonder if it is one of those public position vs private position things, or whether he somehow owes the people he is nominating."
damfqft,brjoyce44,> Drug Czar ahhhh my bad I thought the Drug Czar was the DEA head
damjb3q,Ambiwlans,There literally is no head of the DEA because the GOP won't look at appointments from Obama.
damk7x4,brjoyce44,Yeah sometimes I forget we haven't had an actual government for 4+ years.
dameu1q,LBJ20XX,Does he need congress to just get the ball rolling?
damiep6,DaBuddahN,"In a sense. The head of the DEA is the one who initiates the scheduling/descheduling process, and the head of the DEA must be confirmed by the Senate, which is Republican controlled - hence the current head of the DEA doesn't believe in marijuana decriminalization. He can't just executive order this like others are implying, such an action would definitely be challenged in the supreme court."
damfyof,thesmokingpants,He could order the DEA to reschedule it.
damg2yk,,No he can't. You don't understand the powers of the president. Just like he couldn't order the FBI to drop the Clinton cases.
damghn8,thesmokingpants,"""The 1970 Controlled Substances Act, which created five tiers of restricted drugs, says the attorney general may ""remove any drug or other substance from the schedules if he finds that the drug or other substance does not meet the requirements for inclusion in any schedule.""If a substance is banned by international treaties – as marijuana is – the law grants the attorney general the power to place it ""under the schedule he deems most appropriate.""

damlb6b,the_red_scimitar,"Congress has no part in drug scheduling. That is guided by existing statute, and implemented by the DEA and FDA - both agencies in the Executive Branch."
damlo2i,,scheduling is not the same as decriminalizing. And the DEA is headed by a right winger. Obama was a fool for his picks to head the FBI and DEA
dammjrr,the_red_scimitar,"Exactly, and even more so if you consider it's been legal in California for years, while entirely illegal federally. Decriminalization > scheduling, when public opinion rules."
damptyh,spamtimesfour,Is that a Clinton hat?
damt7e2,Captinfucker,"Well Obama had a dem congress for two whole years and he didn't do shit, so yeah it is his fault. Congress almost always flips to the opposite of the presidents party."
damu40x,gaymondboofstad,It was an all democratic congress when he was elected...
damj72r,Eurynom0s,"He's done this before when marijuana comes up (and pardoning Snowden, to give another example). He'll just flat-out lie about what he can/can't do to avoid saying that he just doesn't want to do something."
damm1a8,IrNinjaBob,"Honestly though, I feel there would have been a lot larger of a resistance if it was simply Obama using an executive order than it would have with individual states voting for it themselves. I am not saying nothing more could have been done but I don't think the answer was Obama trying to push for legalization at the federal level before the states had time to experiment with it."
damogf8,themiDdlest,How exactly would he have done that? The penalization/criminalization is a law signed by congress.
dampo33,LBJ20XX,Get up in front of a podium. Light up a blunt. Dare somebody to do something about it. The rest will take care of itself.
damq7j2,themiDdlest,Congress is controlled by Republicans. The only way something is Decriminalized federally is by congress acting and repealing the controlled substances act or amending it. There are many reasons we have separation of powers.
damojoo,fec2245,If Obama had become involved early in his presidency it might be less popular of a position than it is today. It might be best for the legalization movement that he stayed largely uninvolved until after we have actual evidence of what legal pot in the US looks like.
damp010,Sw3Et,"It's ok for Obama to leave it to the states, but not for Trump to."
dampmbo,LBJ20XX,It's totally fine if Trump wants to leave it to the states. Or did I miss the point on that one. I'm stoned.
damqtk8,Noobasdfjkl,Why on earth would he spend his political capital on weed with all the other things he wants to get done?
damqzjc,LBJ20XX,Because weed is fucking awesome!
damr0oy,AimlessWanderer,He also didn't want to legalize it for as well for the stigma that still comes with it. Fox News would have its headlines for the next 100 years.
damr77g,LBJ20XX,"If there was anybody who could have pulled it off, it was Obama. He has that kind of swagger."
damv5ab,Bangkok_Dangeresque,"He didn't need to, but it was probably smart that this is how he chose to do it.Because you probably noticed that with state-by-state legalization, their legislation goes to great pains to specify the boundaries and restrictions surrounding growing, refining, packaging, labeling, licensing, distribution, sales, consumption, and financing. Specifically to avoid the ire of federal agencies that have the legal basis to stop them.Without that forethought, what would have happened if marijuana were suddenly re-scheduled? Chances are, it would have been a bonanza for the Mexican smugglers Canadian Chinese mafia growers that dominated supply, as opposed to the multi-billion dollar cottage industry currently thriving in the states."
damfab9,ILikeLenexa,"He also could have the DEA raid dispensaries in Colorado daily and/or work to find and confiscate their stored money. The Trump administration can start doing that the day they step into office as well. Ignoring isn't the *best* he could have done, but it's a whole lot more friendly than he could've been."
damg3gv,CrustyGrundle,The DEA is part of the Executive branch. He could have gotten it rescheduled if he actually wanted to.
damqr7g,Since_been,"Still wouldn't have been federally legalized. Plus, for all the other political issues Obama faced, using political capital to fight marijuana prohibition would have been a huge waste when the states are falling like dominoes. -Trust me, I play a lot of Democracy 3. Shit's tough /s"
damsdqf,CrustyGrundle,"He literally just has to tell the head of the DEA ""I want you guys to reschedule marijuana, or I will nominate a new head of the DEA to do that."" The guy works for Obama as the DEA is an extension of the executive. If marijuana wasn't on the schedule, it actually would be legal federally."
damtl93,DaBuddahN,Needs to be confirmed by congress. The President doesn't have sole discretion over all of his appointments.
damv3mv,CrustyGrundle,"Yes that's true, and guess who he chose to nominate a little over a year ago? Chuck Rosenberg, the current acting head of the DEA, who called medical marijuana is ""a joke."""
damxmvv,xynder0,"the DEA Administrator serves at the pleasure of the president. so he can tell him what to do, effectively."
danbkxv,sustainably_extinct,He could have fired everyone and disbanded the DEA. That would be my choice.
damim9w,farhanorakzai,The same Clinton who said in her paid speeches that she's 100% against legalization?
damn8iq,,"Same with single payer healthcare. But no people will forever believe she was on the side of the people because she was a Dem and lost so they never got to see otherwise. I understand the distaste for Trump, but why people think Hillary is anything less than awful is beyond me"
damp2rw,percussaresurgo,">people will forever believe she was on the side of the people because she was a Dem and lost so they never got to see otherwiseThose of us who actually pay attention saw that she ""did otherwise"" when she supported many progressive reforms as an attorney, as First Lady, as a US Senator, as Secretary of State, and as a presidential candidate. She has a consistent record of fighting for progressive causes."
daqbvvq,,"I view her history differently but its because I think her integrity is completely gone at thus point. I guess its all on judge of character and views of intent, so sorry if I came across condescending. Cant stand that kinda bullshit, ""my thoughts are right and you must be less intelligent / morally inept / completely misinformed to have a dissenting opinion"" bullshit and my bad for adding to it"
damzhq5,GNU_Troll,Dude she got a child rapist off the hook. Who cares if she pretends to care about minorities.
danao0t,percussaresurgo,The name says it all.
daqc0uf,,"The job of an attorney isn't pretty at times. Getting a child rapist off means you are a good attorney, not a bad person. Attorneys have to defend criminals and fight for people they know are wrong. Its essential that everyone has a defense, better 10 people walk free than one be wrongfully have his or her life ruined. How she handled talking about it was horrible, but I'd be amazed to see anyone come out on top from that being brought up. Dont judge her character one bit on this from this"
dasg3m5,percussaresurgo,"You are completely correct, but I'm not sure why you felt the need to tell me this. Did you intent to respond to someone else?"
damoqn8,farhanorakzai,"I just don't understand it. Sure, hate Trump as much as you'd like, but at the same time, give Hillary what she deserves too. She's far from perfect and has a record of actually doing the things Trump is saying. She shouldn't get a free pass"
dampw62,bokonator,"If Trump actually drained the swamp, I feel like Clinton would have been worse."
damt3sb,Penuwana,He isn't president yet. It's now a question of which swamp will be drained. Given his disconnect with the party I imagine it wont be as GOP-aligned as expected.
damuqyg,bokonator,We'll just have to wait and see with a character like him.
damuyh0,Penuwana,"All I am saying, I just wish it didn't come with so many downvotes."
damt9uz,Captinfucker,"I mean Clinton is the swamp, so having her hopefully stay away from politics for the rest of her life is a godsend to the country. At the very least we need to give Trump props for breaking her and her cabal in the DNC."
damut00,bokonator,People are overreacting the Trump thing. Clinton is as bad as him on many issues. She just lies about it and everyone believes her.
damprer,patientbearr,You really think Clinton was going to go after states that legalized it had she won?I highly doubt it. She is a creature of public opinion and would go with the majority stance.
damrrsx,2uneek,"depends how much the pharma's were willing to pay her really, that's my issue with her... she's a walking pricetag"
dams1wr,patientbearr,> she's a walking pricetagAnd Trump is not?
damtc3g,2uneek,I never said Trump wasn't? The context of this discussion was Clinton. Read the thread...
damtd23,Captinfucker,"A lot harder to buy someone with as much money as Trump has. Also he already has his own business that keeps making money. All Clinton's money was donations for political favors or promises of political favors. That makes her a lot easier to bribe, as she already got $100+ million from bribes already and doesn't have anything else to fall back on."
damtl94,patientbearr,I disagree. Trump is a businessman. His M.O. his whole life has been profit. Him already being rich hasn't stopped that.If he actually divests all of his businesses I think it will be a massive change in his daily routine and lifestyle.
damt4hv,Penuwana,She's a private prison advocate whether she will admit it or not.
dampzqq,farhanorakzai,I never said that. I was just repeating what she promised her donors behind closed doors
damq9vj,patientbearr,"I never alleged that you did, I just asked the question."
damdu1b,versipelis,"I mean... California legalized it. Does he plan to arrest every Californian? Does he think one of the wealthiest, biggest states, in the nation is going to just lie down for the DEA? This is a war the Republicans cannot win."
damdztc,shhhhquiet,"It's still illegal at the federal level. California doesn't have to prosecute it any more than sanctuary cities have to do ICE's job for them, but yes, the new AG can order federal raids on dispensaries and arrests of citizens and there's nothing California can do about it but threaten to secede again."
damfdvi,bongggblue,It's also creating some interesting financial conditions in places like California and Colorado where people are sitting on boatloads of cash but federally can't make it legit.
damf77u,rguin,"It's more than just ""What, legally, can they do?"" There's always a PR aspect in politics. Videos of cops raiding businesses would destroy the GOP's image, and violence on behalf of the cops (which is basically an inevitability of raids) would only make that worse."
damfc3c,shhhhquiet,We're not talking about 'the GOP.' Trump is not beholden to the GOP. He's never been a politician before and after he's gotten what he wants from the presidency he never will again. Will some of his policies hurt the GOP? Sure they will. Will that stop the idiots he's appointing to his cabinet? Don't count on it.
damffal,rguin,It'll stop them if they want congressional cooperation. Congress people who suddenly find their once-safe seats at-risk because videos of jackboots raiding peaceful businesses won't stop pouring out will suddenly stop being so keen on cooperating.
damfqdv,shhhhquiet,Which is one of many reasons why Trump is going to be ultimately bad for the republican party. He doesn't care.
damfvs2,rguin,Fair argument there... and that's the thing that has me torn about a Trump presidency.Of course I oppose the array of anti-liberty stances presented by him and his cabinet... but the silver lining is that his gang of lunatics is bound to cause severe rifts in the GOP.
dampctv,percussaresurgo,I'd gladly trade rifts in the GOP for not having to worry about Trump provoking WWIII.
dampasu,percussaresurgo,"The average American knows Trump is a Republican president, so raids like that would, in fact, hurt the GOP's image, especially the idea of them being champions of ""small government."""
dampub2,patientbearr,But Trump's attorney general would be the one enforcing it.I doubt Trump gives a fuck about legalized weed. Sessions might though.
dameyg7,Byteflux,"Except they won't continue the raids. Other states are collecting massive tax revenue from recreational legalization. The movement for marijuana legalization is too big to fail at this point (from a political standpoint), considering its enormous success in many states."
damf597,shhhhquiet,"> Except they won't continue the raids. ""Continue"" the raids? There are no raids in states that have decriminalized marijuana. Sessions will probably start them again, though, because a lot of economically anxious people just elected somebody who *does not give a crap* about state tax revenue when it comes to gleefully stomping on others' rights."
damfygx,Byteflux,"Right, continue, as in resume the raids that Obama stopped a while ago.You may be right, considering most of the states with legal marijuana are solidly blue states that will have no impact on the right in any reelection campaign.I am still skeptical, though."
damo03r,tacknosaddle,[There are still raids by the feds](http://time.com/4080110/dea-medical-marijuana-california-ruling/) on medical marijuana operations. At least there were recently and I'm not sure how this ruling has shaken out there.

damgor5,tookmyname,"Threaten all the banks and the industry stays illegitimate. ""Legal"" mj it is not."
damneit,chriskmee,"7 states have legalized or will soon legalize recreational marijuana, many more have legalized medical marijuana. The problem is that federal law trumps state law, so technically its still illegal in every state that legalized it.This basically means the states aren't going to enforce the federal ban on marijuana, but if the feds got involved (which they have done to some marijuana stores) then you would get in serious trouble."
damo5cz,versipelis,"Quick question, based on my understanding, substance control is a reserved power, right? What basis did the federal government use to gain control of drugs? Was it that ridiculous commerce clause crap/power of the purse thing?"
damq14n,chriskmee,"The government has the right to control substances under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970. It was passed in a legal manner, so I think there is little argument over the constitutionally sound nature of it. I think it was done in the name of public safety, which for drugs like meth, heroin, and even many prescription drugs, controlling them for public safety made sense. Its unfortunate that marijuana got put in the same category as meth and heroin, since it clearly doesn't belong there."
damfbox,bongggblue,"Obama plans on going back into hustling trees. About to redefine ""serving your country""...he even got a new pager."
damg39d,KarmicWhiplash,"> He's 'made it happen' thus far by having his AG look the other way as states legalized medical and recreational marijuana. He doesn't get enough credit for this. Colorado legalized medical back in 2000, but it was totally underground for fear of the Feds. It wasn't until Obama called off the DEA that it came out of the shadows and that led directly to the recreational referendum and its passage. People saw it being normalized and the sky wasn't falling.Source: Living in CO the whole time. Saw it happen."
damq351,themouseinator,"Wait.... How were they able to legalize it ""underground"" without the Feds noticing?"
dan70x4,KarmicWhiplash,"The referendum legalized it within the state, so city/county/state cops weren't enforcing anything, but the feds were still a risk."
damkz12,the_red_scimitar,"Well, that was what the news reported, but I hope we've all learned that our sources of news are far from accurate, truthful, or complete.In actual fact, though this was reported and I'm sure something was written, the DEA continued to crack down and force closure of entirely legal cannabis businesses in California. And yes, this was the feds, not state. In fact, about the longest-running, fully-compliant, FAMOUSLY compliant dispensary, was raided and shutdown without EVER showing any crimes.There is money in this industry, and thus, dirty politics. Obama is hardly an outsider in that game."
damiai2,ghosttrainhobo,HRC has stated that she is comprehensively against cannabis legalization.

damixih,ghosttrainhobo,You can't trust what she says anyway. What do the people who donate to her want?
damj2xm,shhhhquiet,Sure you can. Her actual record is very consistent. That's why most of the attacks on her center around 'revealing' what she's 'really' like: they can't use her record against her because her record is solid.
damogxg,NikeSwish,Weren't her two biggest arguments against her (other than emails) about how she flip flopped on gay marriage and the TPP?Edit: Downvoted for ever questioning Hillary :D love this sub
damouk0,shhhhquiet,"Clinton has been pushing for incremental progress on gay rights for decades, such as the civil unions which undoubtedly played a major role in the gradual acceptance of gay marriage which finally led to the supreme court ruling a few years ago. Her position changed on TPP because the *deal* changed. If that's the worst anyone can find it boggles my mind why anyone would find her inconsistent or untrustworthy."

damx4d6,HnB_01,You can't take wikileaks seriously cause the Russians are behind it.
damon9n,shoe788,Obama also flipped on gay marriage
damoxo5,NikeSwish,I'm not saying no one else hasn't (and certainty not saying Trump is better in this regard). I was just commenting on how her track record isn't exactly perfect.
dampe4t,fec2245,"Almost every 70 year old who supports gay marriage changed their position at some point. Flip flopping is when you go back and forth. Not when you change your mind on a issue. We should condemn people for changing their mind, the problem is when you change your mind multiple times in an election cycle it seems like you have no convictions which isn't the case here. An example of flip flopping is when Trump was in favor of H1-B visas before the campaign, against it early in the primary, said he changed his mind in a primary debate and was in favor of them and then opposed them in the general election."
dame3f9,Ohmiglob,"Clinton was strictly anti-potEdit: Chelsea said it can Kill, Hillary said to banks she was strictly against it (her private position), her public position was one of states rights which as the GOP knows is the biggest cop-outs in lieu of action."

damem9l,,That's not the rhetoric Chelsea Clinton was spewing
damf21b,shhhhquiet,I don't know what comments you're talking about or when or where they were made; I just know what Clinton's stated policy was.
damfuuw,ohh-kay,">A spokeswoman for Chelsea Clinton now says that the Democratic presidential candidate's daughter simply misspoke.>An audience member had asked the younger Clinton about her mother's support for changing the federal regulatory status of marijuana to allow more research into potential medical uses of the drug. Chelsea responded that Hillary Clinton supports more research, and that she supports the states experimenting with various medical and recreational regulatory regimes for marijuana.>Then she said the following:>But we also have anecdotal evidence now from Colorado, where some of the people who were taking marijuana for those purposes, the coroner believes, after they died, there was drug interactions with other things they were taking.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/09/28/chelsea-clinton-misspoke-on-marijuana-risks-spokeswoman-says/?utm_term=.828821e5bed1"
damg4f1,shhhhquiet,"Ah, of course. A retracted statement by Chelsea Clinton about medical marijuana research outweighs Clinton's own stated policy. This is the problem with Clinton hate: they hold her more responsible for things she said and did decades ago or retracted statements made by surrogates than they do Trump for things he personally and repeatedly said while on the campaign trail."
damlxqm,mafian911,"If only she could stop flip flopping, we might know where she actually stands.I guess that's our fault, right?If you want to know what Clinton stands for, ask everyone what they want to hear.

damn1rs,shhhhquiet,"What, you're upset because I didn't quote every word you wrote? Sorry for hurting your feelings. Her record is clear: she follows through on campaign promises. Her 'private position ' is not the one she governs on."
damndd4,mafian911,"Not sure where you found this record, but personally I find MP3's to have much better sound.But I appreciate the nostalgia of turn tables. They go back to a simpler time, a time when politicians could get away with whatever they wanted to. Then the internet happened. Don't let it get you down. When you need reassurance, go put your record on, and listen to it repeat, ""Hillary is an honest politician. She represents us the people, not her corporate sponsors.

Look at the documentaries about businesses in Colorado how banks wouldn't take their money because the feds might just take it. All the feds raids on medical places in Cali. Obama saying this shit with a month left in office is meaningless when he spent 8 years doing nothing. With how he's acted I expected him to say that the federal government won't recognize the states legalizing it. He could have gotten it reclassified months ago. He could pardon people in prison for weed related crimes. I really hope people aren't praising him for saying a quote like this when he could have had actual change right now even but has drug policies that look exactly like any of the christian republicans this website hates so much."

dan6mne,Pls_Send_Steam_Codes,he also looked away while LEGAL dispensaries got raided at an ALL TIME HIGH. It works both ways
danaa3c,iRonin,"So, I mean, I like Obama too, and I think I'd rather him have a third term than either of the candidates this year getting a first one. Buuuuut, he welshed on this one. When he took office the AG's office, working at his direction to figure out the mess with legalized states, and the AG issued a statement that was basically ""If you comply with the State laws regarding marijuana, we'll leave you alone."" It was like two years in before that promise was broken. I don't know if Obama changed his tune, or if Holder did, and Obama either didn't know about it or chose not to stop him. Either way, it was a shit deal, and he didn't do anything to assist any of the several bills concerned with banking and legalized marijuana, and they all failed IIRC. If he really thinks that the morally just thing to do is to treat marijuana like alcohol and cigarettes, he is one of the few people who could singlehandedly make it happen. Hell, it's partly why this is news is that he hasn't taken this position before (and maybe he still hasn't, maybe he just said it, who knows?). Trump has been all over the place on marijuana so I have no idea what to expect from him. The only positive is that he seems easily swayed by public opinion, and there's a decent amount in favor of legalizing cannabis. Course he could also set us back 30 years. No fucking idea with this guy."

damrskm,duffmanhb,"What are you talking about? This place is an echo chamber which YOU'RE part of. Facts? What facts? Obama half assed MMJ. He very well could have expended more political capital on this issue, instead of laughing it off every time he was questioned about it. He could have picked a better DEA lead. He could have got them to reschedule it to something more reasonable. He could have done a lot more than just not impede the state laws (which is still quietly happening, because that civil forfeiture money is too good). And speaking of facts, when did Sessions say he's going to roll all that back?"

He could have promised zero taxes, a pony, and a toothbrush for everyone in the country (and make the moon pay for it) and congress would oppose him, just because he's Obama."
damk3ob,dermotBlancmonge,it became legal in many states on Obama's watch
damko9u,shingonzo,and risk getting kicked out? he would wait till the last minute if he was gonna do anything at all.
daml3ud,VROF,The way he did it the states have legalized it. He has the voice of the people behind him now
dammdxi,TheMeiguoren,Well he wouldn't have been able to smoke while in office even if he had it legalized. Clearly Obama is now thinking about his own post-presidency recreation.
dammy41,one-eleven,"Make it happen? Here's how it would go down. Obama proposes to make marijuana legal, congress that is controlled by the Republicans votes no and starts calling him out on being weak on drug cartels, against families, not caring about the children and being a black man who just wants to make it easy to smoke up.It was never going to go through, so why would he let it be used as an attack against him and the democrats by the right?"
damnbd7,Zhangsanity,Yeah cause one person has all the power to do that in our government right?
damppal,LBJ20XX,Right.
damnlc7,hamernaut,"Shit, I went down to the store and bought some weed just this morning. You just live in the wrong place. Thanks Obama! Let's smoke a blunt sometime!"
damo7u5,cp5184,Hillary clinton promised to reschedule marijuana.
damp2jl,GoOutsideNerds,Why is this comment coming up so much? Does nobody on Reddit actually understand politics?
dampjx1,LBJ20XX,Totally. Does nobody on Reddit understand deadpan humor?
damqa41,Dolphin_Titties,"From my vantage point (UK) he did a pretty good job of it didn't he? I mean, you can buy weed and smoke it in loads of places in the US..."
damr403,LBJ20XX,"Oh yeah. My biggest criticism of Obama, personally, is literally that weed isn't legal on the federal level. Now as far as criticisms go that barely moves the needle. He didn't go after states which is all I really cared about since I live in one of the first two states to legalize it recreational wise. My whole ""You had 8 years, Obama"" didn't come across Reddit very well. Imagine a stoned ass stoner going ""You had 8 years, OBAMA!!!"" That's me."
damt102,RealityIsMyReligion,"The president doesn't have sweeping policy powers. He can't just tell he DEA to do what he says.Obama cannot legalize marijuana. He can fight for it, and he has, but that decision comes to the House, Senate, the DEA, any state with their own cannabis laws, and of course, the POTUS (in that order)."
damth1m,LBJ20XX,"I know. But he could spark one in the oval and say ""What are you gonna do about it?"" directly in to the camera."

There are already some who don't care, once the stigma of crime with pot goes away more will ignore it imo. Obviously some people will never agree but even legalization in a few states has changed a lot of people's opinions imo. I've talked to a lot of people and they don't see mj as nearly a problem anymore when compared to all the heroin or meth heads nowadays because they see the Success in these few states and they didn't fall apart or go crazy with ""people addicted to weed""."

damssgo,ViggoMiles,"Never a super majority, not something that can stop a veto."
damt04l,percussaresurgo,"I think you're confused. Bills start in Congress and are then signed by the president. Since 2010, the Republican Congress was not going to pass a law to legalize marijuana. That bill never would have reached Obama's desk."
damtslx,ViggoMiles,"I'm not confused about anything.Obama could have done it within the last 8 years, no bill or congress needed. Later on, if congress wanted to introduce a bill to stop him, he could have vetoed it."
damudvi,percussaresurgo,"I see what you're saying, sorry.That wouldn't prevent them from re-prohibiting it on Jan. 20, though."
damv9ra,ViggoMiles,"No, but if no one tries, then it have no hope of succeeding."
dan6h1u,GODZiGGA,The point is a law never need to be passed by Congress; an executive order could have done it. This entire comment chain is about Congress passing a law to make it illegal if Obama signed an executive order descheduling it. Obama would have veto'd and then Congress wouldn't have had the votes to override the veto.
dammlfb,ThePunisher56,"Doesn't matter. The publicity alone would push the issue far more further.He could've done this 2009, publicized Congress telling him ""Hell no"" and social media would've attacked that harder that another justified police shooting."
damp9ks,wioneo,"> social media would've attacked that harder Ah social media.Once social media users start voting anywhere near as much as their pot hating parents, that may start to matter."
damsiz4,tree_jayy,This made me sad for some reason.
damnoc2,FatPeopleSmell,I must say i totally disagree. President Obama is a smart man. I sure in his mind this is the best route for him to push this cause forward. He could of done a lot of harm by putting his opinion out about this while still president. Republicans did and would have fought him on anything. They have also been in power since 2010.That being said if he really wanted to make a huge change he could of made it happen. But I would of meant that something like the ACA wouldn't of happened. You can only get so much done as president in a set time frame.

dampy60,,"They could, and that would be a solid way for everyone involved in passing that law to lose around half their voting base. ~60% of Americans want marijuana legalized -- not only is it the right thing for Obama to do, but it would also be a huge power play."
damq3lx,percussaresurgo,"If they passed the law quickly enough that marijuana was never really legal and available, most voters wouldn't even know. If voters paid attention even *that* much, Trump would have lost in a landslide."

damqf55,,"If you actually unironically believe that your position is the only rational one, then you're as bad as the Fox News talking heads."
damqui7,percussaresurgo,"I never said my position is the *only* rational one, I'm saying it's *a* rational one, which can't be said about people who think the US has historically high levels of crime and illegal immigration, that any politician will be able to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US, that anthropogenic climate change isn't real, or that Earth is 6,000 years old. Those beliefs are objectively irrational."
damqym0,,I believe none of those things. Good talk though.
damr30i,percussaresurgo,"Unfortunately, many people voted for Trump because they *do* believe at least one of those things."
damr872,,"Do you have any evidence for that belief that a significant amount of Trump supporters voted based on irrational beliefs, that those people would not have voted for Trump if they didn't hold those beliefs, and that Trump would have lose the election by a landslide had he lost those votes (and that Clinton voters voted based on rational beliefs), or are you going off a hunch?"
damrsx7,percussaresurgo,"We can't overlook the fact that they voted for a candidate for whom facts clearly do not matter. For instance, he repeatedly looked straight into the camera during debates and interviews and claimed that he did not say things that audio recordings and high-definition video showed he clearly *did* say, often just a few days before. He flat out lied, repeatedly, to the world. The fact that they could support someone like that he lied so blatantly, so recently, so many times, means they're at least OK with the idea that facts don't matter. But more specifically...Trump got about 80% of the Evangelical vote, a group who, like Ben Carson, largely does not believe in evolution and thinks the earth is around 6,000 years old.Furthermore...>A survey taken this May found that about two-thirds of Trump supporters believe Obama is a Muslim.>The same poll found 59 percent of Trump supporters believe Obama was not born in the United States.>A poll of 16,000 Americans conducted by Reuters in June found that 40% of Trump supporters believed that blacks were more “lazy” than whites and nearly 50% believed blacks were more “violent” than whites. (A smaller percentage of Clinton supporters held these views.)>In the same poll, 16 percent of Trump supporters admitted they believed that “whites are a superior race,” while an additional 14 percent said they were “not sure.”https://thinkprogress.org/is-hillary-clinton-right-about-trump-supporters-this-is-what-the-polling-data-says-2b37625a1df3#.mihbw84qy>Four in 10 Donald Trump supporters think Hillary Clinton 'is an actual demon'http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-demon-poll-republican-voters-beliefs-a7388546.htmlOnly 22% of Trump supporters believe in anthropogenic climate change.

dams8fi,,"> The fact that they could support someone like that means they're at least OK with the idea that facts don't matter.You're ignoring the fact that there are multiple candidates in the election. You don't have to agree 100% with a candidate to vote for them, you just have to align with one candidate more than another. To ignore that is to ignore that Trump and Clinton were the two most unpopular presidential candidates in history.As for your data itself, it doesn't show any of the things you are asserting (that Trump supporters voted based on irrational beliefs, that they would not have voted for Trump if they didn't hold those beliefs, that Trump would have lost the election by a landslide had he lost those votes)."
damsmoh,percussaresurgo,"Don't take my word for it. The best way to tell is by just looking at the strategy Trump and his campaign used. To the extent they actually discussed issues, they relied almost exclusively on claims that were either unsupported by the facts, or directly contradicted by them. Trump went on at length at his acceptance speech and in his stump speeches about the danger of massive illegal immigration (even though more illegal immigrants are leaving the US than entering) about rampant crime (which is down almost everywhere significantly in the past 10 years) and saying things like ""they rip the baby out of the womb"" when they perform abortions, despite that being absolutely false. They wouldn't have done that if they didn't think they could get away with it, and the fact that they won shows they were right."
damsxkz,,"""Getting away with"" something does not translate to your assertion that Trump voters voted based on their irrational beliefs and would have voted differently had they not held those beliefs. It also does not support the idea that Trump would have lost by a landslide had Trump's voters not held those irrational beliefs. As I said: there were multiple candidates. You didn't have to support everything about one to vote for one, you just had to support them more than the other candidates.Feel free to reply with something supporting your assertion if you actually have something of the sort, but seeing as you haven't been able to do that thus far, it is apparent to me that you did not base your assertion off of facts, but rather your irrational beliefs."
damt7fa,percussaresurgo,"You're asking me to read the minds of every Trump voter and to construct an alternate reality in which they voted based on beliefs other than those they actually held. You're asking for the impossible.Instead, take a look at the evidence I've already presented. Things like scientific polls and the conclusions *the Trump campaign itself* drew about their voters are the best methods we have of doing that. If technology comes along that allows us to play with alternate realities, I'll gladly test my conclusions that way."
damt8z9,,I'm asking for you to support your assertion. You obviously didn't base your assertion on reality; therefore you can't support it. You hold an irrational belief: it is that simple.
damtekn,percussaresurgo,"Once again, look at the polls and the actions of the Trump campaign. That's evidence whether you choose to dismiss it or not. I don't care if it doesn't convince you, but my assertion is based on evidence."
damti9i,,Basing an assertion on evidence doesn't matter if the evidence doesn't support your assertion.
damtl9b,percussaresurgo,"It does, you're just choosing to not admit it.It's obvious to any unbiased observer that polls showing Trump supporters believe irrational things, that Trump himself said irrational things, and that Trump himself purposefully exploited their tendency to believe irrational things, is good evidence that they voted for him based on irrational things."
damtooa,,"Your evidence supports the assertion, ""some Trump supporters believe irrational things"". Your evidence does not support the assertion, ""Trump would have lost by a landslide if his voters did not believe irrational things"" (i.e. the assertion you actually made).I will be done replying here unless you can provide evidence of the latter assertion."
damu8a6,percussaresurgo,"Perhaps ""in a landslide"" isn't unsupported, but he lost the popular vote by around 2.4 million and if 50,000 total votes in three states went the other way, he would have lost the electoral vote too. Many things could have swung it the other way, many of them much less of a factor than this. I think the conclusion that he would have lost the election if not for the widespread irrational beliefs of his backers is well-supported."
damtlbk,,"> saying things like ""they rip the baby out of the womb"" when they perform abortions, despite that being absolutely false.(as someone who's pro-choice, for the record) you're actually just factually wrong here. Dilation and Evacuation involves exactly that: fetal tissue being ripped apart and extracted with forceps."
damtxpu,percussaresurgo,"First, that fetus is not what most people would recognize as a ""baby."" Second, what Trump actually said was current abortion law allows one to “rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month, on the final day."" >doctors were shocked — and dismayed.>“That is not happening in the United States,” said Dr. Aaron B. Caughey, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University. “It is, of course, such an absurd thing to say.

That's how small and meaningless his legacy was."
damqoq3,percussaresurgo,"That was the major thing, of course not the only thing. The other big thing was getting the US out of Iraq, which he also did.If you think Obamacare is going away, I have a bridge to sell you. No way the Republicans can just take health insurance away from 20-30 million people. If they replace it with something else, it will have to have the same effect. They'll call it something else so they can keep deceiving gullible voters into thinking they really did something, but the rest of us will know that those people have health insurance because of what Obama accomplished."
damxh3y,voksul,"They absolutely may if they think they can somehow distribute the blame to the Democrats. I don't think it is cut and dry as you make it seem, and I think the most likely scenario is a significant rollback on healthcare with the negatives of that move being attributed to the Democrats or the original plan, somehow."

damy837,HRpuffystuff,"Excuses excuses. Congress couldnt stop bush from starting wars, and thats their job. Obamas just a pussy"
daml7ag,Nuranon,"Thats not how the presidency works. Republicans are willing to break *everything* Obama creates/ed and have their base behind them in that regard (look at gun sale spikes when he mentioned gun control)...his first term was dominated by trying to avoid a Great Depression and Obama Care, he spend *huge* amounts of political capital on both, to the point where Obamacare is only a distant cousin of what he imagined and hoped it would be. And if you look at his second term you will notice that hos two big accomplishments (Paris deal and Iran deal) are in foreign policy where he has way more power as the president than in domestic stuff.So he had spend much political capital on other (most certainly more important) things which would have made any push for legislation in that direction hard on its own but additionally republicans decided to block everything he did so not doing anything and let progress happen through the states is actually a solid approach, given that it doesn't alert republicans as a democratic push for changes on the federal level would.I know that this is super frustrating but US politics is broken and you have to work around that."
damlm74,lastsynapse,"Exactly, you have to spend political capital to get stuff done. Not only that, but not having a public stance on a particular topic allows wiggle room in negotiation. In order to get a comprehensive deal together, people need to be willing to give a little. I don't think that means US politics is broken - I take that to be a good thing. I'd much rather have my politicians willing to find middle ground to get things done in less than optimal ways then to have one representative fighting everyone and holding steadfast in their position."
dammn0v,nerdyintentions,"Well, politicians are politicians and have to worry about winning elections (even if you're in your second term, you don't really want to screw over your party for the next election). Support for Marijuana legalization has only recently crossed over the 50% mark. Last poll I saw was at 57%. So you're probably thinking ""Ok, fine. Maybe Clinton or Carter couldn't do it while in office but Obama can because there is enough support. Over half the country wants this. Democracy, damnit."". Maybe. Here is the problem. A lot of that 57% is made up of young people who are unreliable voters and a lot of the 43% against is made up of older people who are extremely reliable voters. Thats why the safe position (meaning you won't piss off too many voters) with the current level of support is to say ""leave it up to the states!"".If younger people voted as reliably as older voters, rescheduling would have probably already happened. In fact, you wouldn't need to wait on a President to sign an executive order because Congress would have taken action."
damo6v2,cp5184,Hillary clinton promised to reschedule it.
damol3q,CharlieChaplin666,Yeah sure man in 2008 everyone was for the legalization of marijuana right? The president of the damn country should have told everyone it's fine to smoke weed....

damonlz,nomi1030,You think no one got arrested for Marijuana in the last 8 years? Get real. Plenty of people were arrested under his rule.
damp6bp,ryantwopointo,"But he didn't jail them. He may have passively allowed it to happen, but he's not a fucking judge or cop. His position is difficult. He has taken a more progressive stance than any before him, cut him some slack."
dampog7,nomi1030,"No he has not, it's all talk and no action. There have been more raids at medical dispensaries under Obama's rule than under Bush which says a lot. Look up the facts before you throw out false statements."
damq1j8,ryantwopointo,That's an incredibly skewed statistic. You know how many more dispensaries there are now under Obama than there were under Bush?
damr5mo,nomi1030,"Medical? There are less under Obama now because Obama had them shut down. He also spent tons more money having these places shut down. [Really, do some research before blindly supporting everything Obama does.](https://www.thenation.com/article/obamas-war-pot/) That is just one source that can show you the difference between Bush and Obama on the topic. Fact of the matter is he could have done something yet he did nothing."
danakti,Bobbyore,If he did it two years ago maybe the GOP would have gained momentum and took control of all the branches......especially since a lot of if the country seems to favor it now I don't think it would have been a tough blow if one at all.

damnow0,Shootsucka,I would imagine that states that have state laws against MMJ would quickly change their tune as to not lose out on taxes related to MMJ. It would also allow for states to quickly remove laws related to MMJ.
damsb1r,TheRealCJ,States turned down what amounts to free money just to spite Obamacare. What makes you think they'd suddenly change their minds when they think they have an actual moral obligation to reject legislation?

damoz2d,Wiseduck5,">But the majority of the US would benifit and see changes in MMJ laws and policy, agree?Yes, but a lot of people don't care about facts or data. More often than not it takes the federal government to drag some states into the present.And that is not happening anytime soon."
damp81c,Shootsucka,"Sure, but in the scenario where MMJ is declasified federally, a majority of states would elect to make MMJ legal. If the president elect decided to reverse that decision, it would be wildly unpopular and would burn a majority of what little political capital he has.So, I still contend that if Obama wanted to do something about it he could and should.

I would imagine that most blue states would welcome legalized MMJ and push for it. Many GOP members are also in favor of legalization.

I honestly don't see one other than a ""fuck you"" to Obama. I don't see him doing that.>He did the most important thing he reasonably could, stop federal enforcement in states that legalized it.I agree, this was a good step. But he could have taken action early in his presedency to move on this. He decided not to, and then decided to drop this bit of detail right before he leaves office. If action had been taken earlier, I wouldn't be suprised if the landscape of legalization would be much different."

damsqlm,Shootsucka,"Lol, touche"
damqchc,the_mods_are_idiots,It wouldn't really be legal in a way that would effect most people. Shops don't spring out of nowhere. There have to still be regulations. California legalized and it's not going to be available commercially for over a year. Making an executive order with a few weeks to go would effectively do nothing.
damljmx,siamesefightingfish,Obama cop out - it would just get struck down what can I do guys?
damn444,Eurynom0s,Then maybe he should have done something while there was time to make it permanent. There'd have been no political appetite for clamping back down once marijuana shops were fully legitimized.
damq996,the_mods_are_idiots,"Yes, maybe he should have. I agree. But I was responding to someone saying he should do it now."

Even if he was scared it would stop his reelection, we could have had 4 years of it. And in either case, the president who re-criminalizes it looks bad."
dampov3,RZRtv,"Bullshit. If Trump actually thought it was a states rights issue, Sessions wouldn't be pushed for AG."
dan6o4z,GODZiGGA,"Look, I'm not a fan of Trump at all, but that isn't technically true. The AG, like all cabinet members, serve at the pleasure of the President. If Trump tells Sessions to back off marijuana, Sessions needs to back off marijuana or risk being out of a job.It is very possible he likes Sessions for numerous other stances but even more likely, his early support for his candidacy."
dan6t6k,RZRtv,"Stances like ""the KKK would be ok, if they didn't smoke marijuana?"" Dude just stop. You need to open your eyes and realize this is happening."

damphqi,FrostyD7,"Whats the downside of pushing for it regardless of what the republicans will/can do? Waste of time and resources I guess? Seems to me that if he made that push and the republicans pushed back, it makes it clear who is holding legalization back and helps the cause."

damq4jz,cp5184,That was probably a federal prosecutor in a conservative area probably trying to score points with someone or other. Obama wasn't involved in any way.
damm4g8,frizzykid,Congrats Obama. You came into your first term promising decriminization and leaving medical marijuana dispensaries alone.

If he nullified all the marijuana related charges, those who are there for those ""crimes"" alone would be free, and those who are in there for other crimes as well would still be locked up. I guess it would reduce their sentences if the MJ parts went, but that should also not be a problem, since theoretically their sentences should now be more proportional to their actual criminality.Further, if it then comes out that violent criminals now have sentences that people deem to be too short without the nonsense drug component, then it would lay a good foundation to look at increasing the sentence length for violent crimes. Why use drug charges to lock away violent criminals for longer rather than just making sentences for violent crimes longer?Of course I have no idea how any of this would work in practice but it seems pretty sensible in principal"

damgrxh,ArminscopyofSwank,"Marijuana should be legalized and sold like booze. Taxes will help the economy. Trump, personally, probably cares very little about this issue. Putting people in jail for non-violent drug offences is a waste of money. Win/Win if Trump goes toward legalization."

damsdvi,birdsofterrordise,"Yeah, I don't think you get quite how this works. Pence and Ryan will have a symbiotic relationship and they are hardcore Tea Party social and cultural Christian conservatives. Sure Trump might not give a fuck but he ain't going to stop shit because he has no idea how any of this works. The Christian Right coalition has a rubber stamp and they hate marijuana, so expect that to get passed through ASAP, states be damned."
damsty0,BarestGoose,"Except Trump wants to be reelected and so do the Republicans. Gonna be hard for him to run on states rights as he did the last few months by shutting down these states. Maybe in the second term, but this could cost him reelection."
damtatr,funkboxing,They'll be fine as long as they beat the drum for other states rights loud enough to drown out the cries from the states they're actually denying rights to.For some reason a states right to decide how to handle some transgender people's bathroom usage is a better sales pitch for states rights than several million stoners in legal states who are just don't want to be put in prison for smoking.
damr9ym,Gorm_the_Old,"> Marijuana should be legalized and sold like booze.That's not what the activists want, though, because if it's fully legalized, the industry will almost immediately be taken over by big corporations and the small growers and dealers will be pushed out of business. What the activists want is a sort of weird gray space between legal and illegal that keeps the cops off their backs but the corporations out of the business. That's why the states that have legalized it like Colorado have byzantine laws that impose all sorts of arbitrary limits on growing, transportation, and sales."
damsph0,youreabigbiasedbaby,">Marijuana should be legalized and sold like booze.No the fuck it shouldn't. It doesn't need to be regulated like alcohol, because smoking shitty weed won't cause you to go blind. There's zero reason people shouldn't be able to privately cultivate and sell marijuana. It's none of the government's goddamn business."
damtxft,ArminscopyofSwank,"If it's for personal use, fine. I think if people grow to sell they should be treated like any other business."
damv6gd,youreabigbiasedbaby,Why?People can sell literally anything else they grow. You're more likely to get sick from a bad potato than bad weed.
damha3c,Bernies_Lakehouse,haha. Do you know much about Jeff Sessions? Dude will start cracking down on marijuana at the state level. You guys are screwed.
dami7io,Allyanna,"Do you really think Trump would allow Sessions to attack state laws regarding marijuana? Trump has already been clear on his stance regarding marijuana. Leave it to the states. Right now the states are moving towards complete legalization. Slowly, but still moving ahead. Florida just passed medical marijuana. Trump would not risk his 2nd term and to take back medical marijuana from Florida and lose the state in 2020."
damje97,sarcastroll,"Trump's AG was picked specifically to go after local laws. He'll be tough on sanctuary cities, for example. I hope you're right and all, but Trump's so in over his head that he won't be running the show. If his cabinet has an agenda, he'll be a pushover. Just look at who he's filling the swamp with."
daml1zi,illonlyusethisonceok,We *should* Be tough on sanctuary cities.

damlfmh,illonlyusethisonceok,"It's not because they're brown skinned, it's because they're here illegally."
damo41b,matata_hakuna,"No dude, laws don't matter. This is /r/politics where you either are against Trump or you're a racist."
damogcm,touchthesun,"If it was the minority opinion Trump wouldn't have been elected. Has nothing to do with skin color, and they aren't ""bugging no one"". They are directly competing with American citizens for jobs at a fraction of the cost. I understand if you've been fortunate enough to never have experienced this type of scenario how it would be easy to assume everyone who is anti-illegal immigrant is simply racist, but in reality the presence of illegal immigrants directly affects the livelihood of many Americans. If you're an American citizen looking for manual labor jobs like landscaping or masonry in states like Texas, it's extremely difficult to find a job with a fair wage because the employers can hire illegal immigrants, skip out on payroll taxes, and spend far less on labor than if they were to hire actual citizens. So many jobs that used to pay American citizens livable wages they could support themselves with are now paying less than livable wages because the increased supply of illegal immigrant labor drives wages down. So illegal immigrants who have directly violated U.S. law are more likely to be hired than U.S. citizens who pay taxes on their income."
damq8pf,sarcastroll,"Except they don't take jobs or decrease wages when we look at the nation as a whole.There are undeniably specific cases for no-skilled labor that they directly compete with. But on the whole they don't do harm. In fact they lead to overall prosperity for the states they are in. Skilled workers make *more* as a result as the unskilled work of illegal immigrants complement the work. A plumber makes more and has more time to do his high end, expensive plumbing work when a low-skilled worker (illegal immigrant) does the menial clean-up work.If we care about the overall prosperity of the country, they are a net benefit. It's a case of misplaced blame. It's easy to blame them for the situation you describe, where unskilled workers used to be able to make a living and raise a family. Illegals depressing no-skill jobs aren't responsible for that. It's the destruction of unions and the low wages they've caused across entire semi to high-skilled industries. It's the skyrocketing costs of living that are. It's unaffordable housing and massive student debt that cause that. It's privatized and expensive as hell healthcare costs. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/do-illegal-immigrants-actually-hurt-the-us-economy.htmlhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/artcarden/2015/08/28/how-do-illegal-immigrants-affect-american-workers-the-answer-might-surprise-you/#7eb37c006b10Study: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/soej.v81.4/issuetoc"
damp1mp,Grandaddy25,And so you blame the immigrants? What about the employers? Who is really accountable here? How about we start cracking down on the business abusing the system we have instead of cracking down on the immigrants trying to make a fucking living for themselves and their families.
damqc1m,touchthesun,"I agree with you, and i don't blame the immigrants, I blame our immigration polices for encouraging them to break our laws. I agree we should crack down on businesses abusing the system, but what happens when you crack down on the employers while all the immigrants (who willfully broke the law) are still here? What happens to them when there is nowhere for them to work? Do you think they'll all pack up and fly home peacefully with all the money they saved working below minimum wage?We'd have millions of undocumented people desperate to feed their families with no legitimate means to do so. Do they just starve to death? Or do they become the states problem? You don't see how that would inevitably be a massive problem? I have **nothing** against illegal immigrants and don't have any problem whatsoever with them attempting to make a living. It's our half ass immigration policies that encourage them to do so. That being said, the issue is far more complicated than people simply trying to support themselves. Laws exist for a reason. They are what hold the fabric of our society together. Right now, the laws we have in place are helping non-citizens who break the law at the expense of citizens who obey the law."
damo2hs,matata_hakuna,"He might be a pushover, we have no idea. Obama however was and is a fucking pushover and didn't even lower the scheduling of marijuana."
dampk0t,sarcastroll,"Nope, but he at least allowed states to experiment, which was a big first step.Yeah, I'd appreciate a full and complete overhaul of the failed 'war on drugs' nonsense. But letting states have some freedom to experiment was a big deal. My hope is that Trump doesn't let his AG reverse that course. We'll see if he can remain focused on his priorities, not those of his cabinet picks."
damktig,Bernies_Lakehouse,"Exactly! I don't think Trump gives a shit about people's right to smoke marijuana. I am guessing that was a key conversation he had with sessions, since that he is all over that kind of thing."
damwbqr,,"Unlike Marijuana, the federal government does have the constitutional authority to regulate immigration. 'The Congress shall have Power To...establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization....""So if federal law says that people can't just walk across the border or overstay their visas, than the federal government can kick them out. Show me where in the constitution congress is given the authority to regulate pot. Nowhere. Was an amendment ever ratified to give the federal government the authority to regulate pot? No. So therefore, the federal government has ZERO authority to regulate pot in spite of what all the herpderp Commerce Clause idiots say."
damjf15,ArminscopyofSwank,"Marijuana is a losing fight. Trump will likely do nothing for, or against, legalization."
damp00c,pedrobeara,still all talk and no action.
damefeo,DevAlexandre,I actually disagree. Cigarettes and alcohol are FAR more damaging to the brain and body than marijuana.
damlw23,CedarCabPark,That's quite a reddit-esque comment. You know what he means damn it. Stop sounding contrary. He means from a legal standpoint.
damzbx4,Sharkoffs,This is my pet peeve about reddit. There's always one fucking contrarian that has to figure out a way to nitpick whatever is being stated. We all know Obama was saying Marijuana should be treated the same under the LAW. So this guy's comment is completely irrelevant to the actual point of what Obama was trying to say.
damhhs9,tookmyname,"That's not the point AT ALL. But I also disagree with you. Most of my family can drink a glass of wine with dinner and that's it. My friends that dab and have nice rigs do so to get high, every time, several times a day. After years of being a mj user I can't pretend that it doesn't have affect on cognitive function, emotional clarity, ambition, etc in a way that typical moderate use of alcohol does not. Every time I used mj I used it to get ""high."" Never seen my patents talking about trying to get a buzz off their drinks. And if they did it wasn't typical. Plain and simple. MJ is a highly psychoactive drug that effects your brain heavily. Being high all the time is bad for you no matter the drug. There's nothing benign about being subject to such an intense artificially mental modification. Mj users who smoke daily are simply addicts, functional or not, or they are patients with a deep need. Cigarettes, will kill you sure, but not quickly, and they won't make you less willing to get up off the couch when it's time to get to work or put down the Xbox controller. I hate how cannabis users always have to act like their drug of choice is harmless and attack others. It's never been helpful to your/our cause."
damip4d,Ashmedai,"> Every time I used mj I used it to get ""high.""On this topic, something similar was said of alcohol use prior to the ending of prohibition. As it turns out, when something is prohibited, the users of it tend to binge behaviors. This is the danger of using past behaviors and expectations (""Every time I used I ..."") to project future outcomes."
damnffi,nerdyintentions,"Kind of makes sense too. If someone is illegal, the only people who would go out of their way to get it are the people who REALLY, REALLY want it. Potential casual users wouldn't go through the trouble (which includes the associated risk of doing something illegal)."
damv03d,sark666,"But that's not his point. You can just enjoy a drink or two without getting intoxicated. I feel absolutely nothing on 2-3 drinks. I may score lower on one of those reaction tests, but I feel completely straight. You can't just enjoy a bit of weed without getting high. Unless it has no thc I guess."
damz3i7,s7uck0,"you certainly can. When cannabis becomes legal, and we're able to acquire a cannabis strain that's lower in THC and higher in CBD you'll find that smoking .5 of a gram should be enough. And two to three drinks? Three beers and I can feel it every time, which I wouldn't expect to be the case if you were doing that every day of the week. I don't drink every day, I probably drink a litre of beer a week, I really don't crave it And I don't crave cannabis. But as it is illegal you have to buy from a dealer. Buying from a dealer means you have to buy in large quantities to keep the price down, so I pick up a half ounce (14 grams ) and that last me about 15 days. I would make it last longer but it tends to dry out and so I smoke it all, average a gram a day so that it doesn't spoil. Hate smoking it dry, if it was legalized I'd buy a gram or two on the weekends since I could have premium product, without having to purchase bigger quantities trying to save $$$, and since theres not a pile of weed lying around getting dry I wouldn't feel like smoking as much."
damzdh0,sark666,"I rarely drink, but maybe 3 beers doesn't affect me cause of my size. But I'll downplay my example. Most can enjoy a beer after work without feeling any effect.And besides people with medical reasons, people aren't seeking out low thc high cbd. I got downvoted, but I was reiterating what OP was saying and I still stand by it. I've known lots of smokers in my time, and they do enjoy the ritual of rolling it, getting ready and smoking it, but make no mistake, the end goal is to get high. They wouldn't enjoy the ritual if it was say 20% cbd and 1% thc and got no buzz in the end."
damzx2p,s7uck0,"I gave you an up vote for being kind in your replies and making a decent post. Ensuring CBD content is present seems to reduce the more heavy psychological effects of cannabis as per the science. I'm saying a strain that's 10% of each would be a mild effect as some of the stronger strains contain upwards of 24% THC. When you say that people smoke to get high, what do you actually mean? I would argue that people don't like to be ""too stoned"" just like they don't like to be too drunk. I think people who have a drink after work are doing it to relax and the same would/could be said about evening cannabis users .All that said, over indulgence of anything is not without its problems."
danhjzg,Ashmedai,"> I feel absolutely nothing on 2-3 drinks. This is because you are either A) very large, or B) drink a lot (i.e., have developed significant tolerance).There's probably also a bit of exaggeration in there as well.> You can't just enjoy a bit of weed without getting high.Your assertion doesn't make this true."
damke0a,square_zero,"To be absolutely fair, marijuana has the most effect on your cognitive growth while your brain is still growing. Once you reach about 25 y.o., the negative effects of marijuana use quickly start to drop off. And like anything else, moderation is key. That said, I do agree with what you are saying. I never used a lot of it myself, but had a handful of friends after graduating high-school who were big pot-heads who didn't go very far. At the same time, I know a large number of people in their thirties and forties who regularly use marijuana in a recreational way and they all seem alright. I hope you're in a good way right now. More important than where you come from is where you are going."
daml8f7,MiracleShot,"You're setting up a strawman argument here. At no point did he say that marijuana was ""benign,"" nor did he claim that ""it doesn't have affect (sic) on cognitive function, emotional clarity, ambition, etc."" At no point did he say marijuana was ""harmless"" or ""attack others."" He simply said that cigarettes and alcohol are FAR more damaging to the brain and body than marijuana, which most scientific literature supports."
damlscy,njott,"I mean yea.. Your literally comparing a glass of wine to a dab of pure thc wax. The equivalent of that would be everclear. It's about moderation. If your friends who got high several times a day got drunk several times a day instead of high, I'm sure they would be worse off."
damnjf6,A_Privateer,Seriously. This dude is comparing a glass of wine to dabs? Fuuuuuuck off.
damo3ut,seventeenninetytwo,"I could take a dab, or I could hit a joint.I could slam shots of everclear, or I could sip a glass of wine.Maybe we should have a competition to see which drug is worse. Have one person takes shots of everclear while one person takes dabs. I wonder which drug will be worse?"
damo5jn,njott,I had to shorten my comment.. I had a rebuttal to more then half his sentences
dampq67,,[deleted]
damqq50,njott,"No I totally agree, decriminalization of all drugs should be the way to go. But. I smoked bud about 2-4 times every day for about 2-3 years. Just bud, not dabs. I can't even say I was getting baked every time, no sense in wasting bud. But I can't say I didn't have a lasting affect me. Just don't feel as clear as I use to. A little foggy I guess. Granted, I can't confirm nor deny that, but it definitely not uncommon to hear that. Shit just makes you lazy too. Like even when your not smoking. And despite what people say.. It's mentally habit forming.. Ya turn into a bit of a bum like 24/7. It's almost too easy to function ""normally"" on it. It's easy to get a little high and go to work or school or whatever. Drinking is a bit harder. And I've never smoked so much it's made me physically ill almost the whole day after lol but back to my main point. It's all about moderation. A glass of wine here and there should be fine along with a drag of weed here and there, just not for me. Every day is a constant battle with laziness in the first place"
damnco7,Symbiotx,"> I hate how cannabis users always have to act like their drug of choice is harmless and attack others. It's never been helpful to your/our cause.I hate how you always use blanket statements as if they apply to everyone that is for something. Those that do use that argument aren't acting like their drug is harmless and attacking others. They are making the comparison because the drug that is illegal is arguably less damaging than those that are legal, begging the question of why is it illegal at all then? Also, most of your examples are anecdotal and perspective, not factual information. You're drawing unfair comparisons like comparing dabs to a glass of wine with dinner. A closer comparison would be comparing a glass of wine with dinner to a couple hits from a joint. A dab is more along the lines of drinking enough to be drunk. You claim that you never hear people talking about trying to get a buzz off their drinks, and if they did that it wasn't typical... give me a break. If you don't know that people drink to get drunk, all you need to do is step into a bar. People don't usually drink for the flavor. They drink because of how it makes them feel to varying degrees.I'm not claiming that it's healthy, and I agree that there's something to be said for addiction and dependency, but you're speaking from a place of personal bias you've developed. I encourage you to take an honest look at the anecdotal evidence you're using and decide if that's really what you want to use to formulate your opinion about this topic."
damm04d,highfivingmf,"Your own experience with something doesn't make you an authority, as you're making it out to be. Just because you only use Marijuana to get high does not mean that's what everyone does. Plenty of people use it medicinally, some in very small amounts to ease pain or anxiety, stress, etc. And on top of that, a glass of wine for most people actually does give a slight buzz especially to those who drink moderately. Cigarettes and alcohol are so much more dangerous than marijuana that is is irresponsible of you to even suggest otherwise. Alcohol and Cigarettes have caused millions of deaths and major health problems. Not to mention the societal impact of alcohol and all of it's secondary effects. They do not compare to the amotivational and cognitive drawbacks of chronic cannabis use."
damoaqs,bicycle,">Most of my family can drink a glass of wine with dinner and that's it. >My friends that dab and have nice rigs do so to get high, every time, several times a dayWine is not in any way, shape, or form analogous to dabs. Stop creating straw men to promote controversy. >Mj users who smoke daily are simply addicts, functional or not, or they are patients with a deep need.Untrue. I get high daily using my vaporizer yet I am completely comfortable with stopping whenever I want. In fact, I've been pretty sick lately and have had to cut back on use 100%. I had no problems with stopping and I have no qualms about starting again when I am healthy."
damm1bf,PredatorRedditer,"I hate how cannabis users are always assumed to be lazy underachievers. If you use a drug to escape reality, you'll do so with other substances or activities. If THC stopped existing, these people's emotional issues wouldn't be resolved all of a sudden."
dammkvp,darkcobrabws,"Here's the problem here. If you take 2 people, one of the friends you described that get high every time several times a day and a guy that consumes the equivalent of alcohol you'll notice the problem is not the substance but the user. A glass of wine with dinner is a much a problem as a quick hit off joint. We can't pick people from the extreme abuse end of weed and the people at the complete opposite end of the spectrum for alcohol and make a comparison.I have a lot of friends of smoke weed and not a single one of them end up couch locked or unable to function or work because of it.Those guys who try to stay high 24/7 youre talking about, if you take away the weed from the equation, they will most likely find something else to abuse, may it be alcohol or other drugs.I know parents who smoke a little after the kids are down to sleep, not to get high as fuck or party, just to relax.It's true, it's not good to be high as fuck all the time but it's again a matter of abusing something good making it bad. Funny enough, abusing water can lead to death. It's all a matter of self control."
damqivs,,"Uhh, comparing dabs to 151 would be more accurate. No one is doing shots of 151 without intending to get fucked up. You absolutely CAN pass a bag or some cookies around casually and get everyone smiling and giggly in a casual social environment of adults and have that be the end of it. Don't blame weed for your fucked up friends. Plenty of people don't do marijuana daily, just like plenty of people don't drink daily. And people who do drink daily are going to be way worse off than people who do weed daily.So many false equivalencies it hurts."
damwmzb,BOATSANDHOEZ,"This is the most close minded argument i've ever seen. People get drunk all day every day. Other people use alcohol responsibly. People get high all day every day. Other people use it responsibly. Comparing your parents one glass of wine to your stoner friends being blazed all day is completely nonsensical. It's no different than comparing someone who smokes maybe a couple nights a week to a raging alcoholic. Neither alcohol nor mj are ""good"" for you. That's not the argument. The argument is that alcohol and cigarettes are worse for you than mj, which is true, and they are accepted, while mj is not."

damui95,johnmal85,"Most of your family doesn't have addictive or habitual use tendencies then. There's plenty of social marijuana smokers, just the same with drinkers. Low doses of less potent marijuana is pretty weak. You're basically saying that all marijuana users cannot handle themselves and the drug us too powerful to use socially here and there. Provide users with a form of marijuana like a low THC oil for a vape pen and it's more social, akin to drinking a beer. Smoking modern day high THC marijuana would be more similar to taking a shot of vodka. I'm pretty sure you wouldn't call that social drinking, right?You may also be blinded by the fact that alcohol use is FAR more prevalent than marijuana use. It has normalized it's use for your baseline. That coupled with the subconscious cognition of the legal status of marijuana can easily make this distinction more difficult for you."

They sure help with my Crohns disease!I wish I could experience this 'high' you're talking about though!

But to be fair I can't drink alcohol...Cuz it makes my insides bleed. Enjoy your wine, addict."

There are a ton of reasons. There are 4 main chemicals (THC, THCA, CBD, CBN) in cannabis that affect you, then in combination of those 4 you have terpenes, which offer an array of different flavors and effects."
damo2do,PM_ME_CLOUD_PORN,I can count the number of times I tasted alcohol in my life with my hands. Only time I actually liked the taste of the drink was a weak sweet shot a girl forced me to take. I'm 24 btw. I liked it but wouldn't say delicious. Beer is disgusting though.
damoysz,jennadaley,"I don't believe that. I have a glass of wine with meals or sometimes just some cheese or meats or fruits because I think the flavors compliment each other well. I think pretty much any other drink (water, soda, milk, juice, coffee, etc.) would taste much worse with a lot of those things. I certainly do not get any noticeable effects of drunkenness from one glass of wine. So why am I drinking it?"

Some people have different tastes and enjoy different things. I'm struggling to see how this is such a foreign concept. Do I get a buzz from wine sometimes? Of course. But I would still absolutely drink wine if it had zero alcohol and do not drink it to alter my mind and often have one small glass to merely pair with what I am having for dinner or a snack.

There are-- i'm quite sure many more people that drink alcohol in larger quantities than smoke pot in large quantities.Also, when you talk about people who smoke pot all the time all day-- MOST jobs will not allow one to be intoxicated-- whether it be on alcohol or pot.My point is--- anyone that has a job that does not allow one to be intoxicated will -for their own and others sake- not be intoxicated.Responsible adults do things in moderation, such that they are not driving or working while intoxicated---- MOST PEOPLE WILL NOT BE GETTING HIGH 5-6 TIMES A DAY.That makes time-consumption of an intoxicant for an ordinary working american comparable- there are times when you are free to do it and times when you are not free to do it. If you are allowing an intoxicant to interfere with work, family, and friends, then you are in the minority and have a problem.People get addicted and need to use intoxicants in excess when they use them irresponsibly with disregard for themselves and others.Also- I STRONGLY believe that being drunk is a more debilitating state than being high, and impairs one's functions to a MUCH MORE significant degree. The intoxicant is not the problem, people that use in excess, and non-legalization resulting in incarceration of millions of americans for petty crimes is the problem. Btw--- I do not smoke pot, so please don't call me a pot- lover coming on here spewing nonsense.Anything not in moderation is dangerous and harmful physically and mentally."
damhmcf,LazamairAMD,"There is no doubt, but Obama is talking about the regulatory aspects."
damrchh,NeverBeenStung,Not the point though. Obama thinks it should be a legal regulated substance as is tobacco and alcohol. Do you not agree with that?
damet0g,zomboromcom,Let's be clear: it's far less dangerous than those.
damp0la,traumasponge,"Well, golly gee! You had eight years to do something about that, didn't you?"
damf0wz,toadfan64,You have the power. DO SOMETHING
damjk0o,SlimLovin,It is absolutely not that simple.
damqb9a,Fallingdamage,"Even if it wasnt, he could make an executive order anyway just as hes leaving. Let the GOP scamble to fix it - in the mean time the public is happy about it and the country gives washington the collective stink-eye when the GOP tries to undo the change. Crap like that could guarantee a DNC win in 2020. The GOP would be wise to leave the order alone and let it be."
damms49,captainslowww,"He's a lame duck President with both houses of Congress under Republican control, and an incoming Republican President who will also have control of both houses. He has precisely *zero* power to do anything that won't be overturned two months from now."
danak73,SolaireOfCaestora,"Fuck it then, why not try with an executive order. If americans have legal weed for 2 months and then its overturned, Trump will be starting out on the wrong foot"
damdcqn,xmagusx,That's cute. If only you had the power to do something to change how it was treated ...
damgaws,ohh-kay,"You mean by changing how it was treated through refusing to enforce federal law? Oh, wait, he did that."
damjw4r,Noxid_,"Oh great, so now that the federal law isn't changed the new administration does what exactly? Oh, you mean they might enforce the federal law? Fascinating."
damk9r5,ohh-kay,"Your anger is misplaced. Obama couldn't change the federal law. By Obama pushing to change it, Republicans would have come out against it strongly and quite possibly thrown a lot of stringent laws against legalization out there. By not enforcing the law over the last few years it has allowed more and more states to pass more and more legalization laws and generate more and more public support. Obama chose not to force Congresses hand over the past 8 years and over those 8 years legalization movements have picked up a ton of steam. Obama did what was best for the legalization movement given his position and opposition."
damnlym,,Yes he could. Drug scheduling is 100% an executive branch affair.
damsme4,TheRealCJ,"Come on, he couldn't say boo by executive order without being called a tyrant. If he tried that Congress would probably try to impeach him."
damsqt2,,Drug scheduling has been an Executive Branch affair for as long as it existed. It's literally just doing his job.
damvy3l,ManOnTheMoon2000,You do not know how the us government works then
damkaum,kivishlorsithletmos,He could deschedule it.
dammf8j,iushciuweiush,"Cool and now that we have a republican president he can decide to start enforcing it again. Wow, thanks Obama! Or maybe he could've instructed the AG or the DEA to deschedule it so that Trump would have nothing to 'enforce' without creating huge public controversy by instructing his AG or the DEA to reschedule it again."
damn07r,ohh-kay,"Anything he did would have been attacked. It is much harder to attack a non-action. Furthermore, if it was descheduled under Obama, it could easily be rescheduled under Trump. Non-enforcement allowed the movement to pick up steam and generate inertia. Your anger is misplaced."
damo0py,iushciuweiush,> Anything he did would have been attacked.Everything any president does is attacked by those who disagree on the other side of the political aisle. What kind of ridiculous argument is that? He shouldn't do anything that he might be attacked over?
danji2s,ohh-kay,1) That isn't true. 2) That isn't what I said.
damrcos,big_hey_22,"If he did reschedule it, it would've been one of the executive orders Trump has pledged to reverse on day 1."
damrv8n,iushciuweiush,"I doubt it. The executive orders he has pledged to reverse all increase federal powers in some way or another, typically by implementing additional regulations. Reversing this one would have the opposite effect as he would be reintroducing previously removed regulations and would be giving back previously removed power the federal government had over the states."
damtboe,big_hey_22,He said all of them.
damtltd,iushciuweiush,...because all of them implemented additional regulations.

damwlv8,ManOnTheMoon2000,You can never make progress if you do nothing. Is he expecting for these changes to happen with him not doing a single thing about it? That's not how government works
damg9p0,rillo561,Don't think anyone has died from cannabis though.
damgml3,,No one in the history of the world have died
dammowv,BoojumG,"Eh, someone probably did something stupid while high and died. We generally include drunk driving in the list of people killed by alcohol, after all."
damz8kr,Inkshooter,"I mean, technically some people are allergic to cannabis, and it can be dangerous to drive while high, but yeah, nobody's died from an actual overdose."

damgom9,Cyber_Gods,"Fuck the DEA they are useless parasites who empower the cartels and pharmaceutical companies. If republicans are looking for budget cuts the DEA should be the first on their list. That would actually continue the narrative that republicans want smaller government, but they don't want smaller government, they just want a different government."
damoxw5,OssiansFolly,That's cool. You know who has the power to make this happen? You do. You should do something about it!
damozax,ReagansRaptor,So true. Its a shame he hasn't had any power to do anything about it for the past 8 years. /s
damw1ss,IMR800X,"Talk is cheap. He needs to either order it regulated as such or shut up with the empty pandering.Since he comes form the party of empty pandering, I'm pretty sure I know which plan he'll stick with."
damwd4z,MasterMachiavel,"Wow how brave! An outgoing President who had 8 whole years to make the case and suddenly he mentions it on his way out of the office just as soon as there are no political repercussions whatsoever! Next up, George W Bush reveals 'I don't think wars are a great idea' 5 minutes before his Presidential term is up!"
dan2z01,Syliase,"So, I've actually studied this in class (or, rather, the topic of ""Why hasn't Obama passed more 'progressive'/'liberal' policies onto Congress?"") various times in pretty much all of my poli-sci classes, even the international ones, and the answers to this are about the same: y'all forget that the President's main job is to be the /executive/ branch--the most he can do is push for laws/policies to Congress, but in the end, it's Congress that makes the laws, and the President must pass it. Remember that through most of his stint as President, he has had a Republican dominated Congress who actively opposed everything he tried to push for, or anything that any Democrat pushed for. It's one of the reasons why the ACA is such a shit-show, actually, even though it's got some good bits. Because the GOP has the majority in both House and Senate, then, it's damn near impossible to get non-partisan policies passed. I'm not trying to make excuses, but Obama may very well be as progressive as he says. But we need to start realizing that it's never as simple as ""well, he /could/ have just made this so!"", since that's literally not how the government works."
danirjv,derekd223,You need to pay for better classes because the DEA falls under the executive and what Obama is doing is the definition of lip service
danmyxr,Syliase,"But you're saying you want a legalization of recreational marijuana, which means you want a policy change. That's Congress's ability/job. DEA regulates and enforces the law, doesn't make laws and can't like everything else under the executive branch. This is basic USGov knowledge.Edit: typos"
damf5x8,im_a_basset_hound,"Jesus, Obama. You've had eight years. Just fucking do it already"
damfwaw,RichieWOP,If only it was that simple.
damqkjq,coolguy_420,It is. Descheduling it is something that can be done by him in a day.
damjxzw,Sonic527,Maybe if he didn't take all that vacation time it would have been done.
damqq65,roshampo13,He took less vacation time than Bush.
damslme,Sonic527,Bush was also a shit president.
dan8b96,woolfchick75,He's taken half the vacation days Reagan took.
dan98ec,Sonic527,Then what the hell was he doing at work? If he took less vacation days why did he fail to do anything in office?
damn8nz,Lmaoboobs,"Vacations or not, He simply doesnt have the power."
damv7sw,e-guy,"He has some.He could have ended the raids immediately instead of allowing them to continue for years and even ramping them up at one point.He has power over the DEA and ATF, and could have forced them to change their policies regarding marijuana. He could have signed executive orders clarifying the sovereignty of the states when it comes to their right to choose what is legal in their state.He could have pushed for marijuana to be classified as a lower grade, non-harmful narcotic, from it's current position up on top of the danger list with heroin.There's quite a lot he could have done, actually. But instead of doing any of that, he actively fought against legalization, and only now that he actually truly has no power does he issue this mea culpa about how ""oh, I was wrong this whole time! Marijuana is fine! Pls ignore my actions over the last 8 years and instead just listen to me talk about how progressive I am on this issue!"""

damr87b,Chrispy_Bites,"Do it, you beautiful son of a bitch. You can legalize it, right now. No approval from Congress necessary. Instruct the HHS to deschedule cannabis. Issue a blanket pardon for everyone in currently in prison for simple possession.DOOOO IIIT."
dameebe,rPOLITICS-IN-MY-ANUS,"What a blow hard, he did nothing to legalize it in 8 years and now he comes out in support? Fuck off."

damor19,JacobCrim88,Y'all got anymore of those executive orders?
damotbo,mcotter12,"I will be impressed when he does something other than say so in a lame duck session. Obama spent the last 8 years treating Cannabis like a dangerous drug, and one statement at the end of his term shouldn't change anyone's opinion of his drug policy."

I could not drive, I couldn't wake up, I couldn't make meals, I couldn't poop from the opiates, couldn't run my team at work. The meds were making me a zombie.

Why has he shown zero leadership on this issue?"

Yes, congress might change it back (voting *for* prohibition when 60% of the country wants it legal could be extremely risky) or Trump might change it back (even riskier for him in 4 years), but considering almost every piece of Obama's legacy will be destroyed by Trump, this could be the last chance for something meaningful."

Appoint a Justice to the Supreme Court, not Garland, but the top choice they had in March.

And as much as I would love Gitmo closed, there are very simple reasons why it can't, namely where would all the prisoners go. If he issues executive orders (which we all know he won't), we might see cannabis legalized though. Better fights that he might win still are forcing all the *other* federal judge appointments through because, like Garland, congress never voted on them. He could issue blanket pardons to all felons not currently in federal prison *and* all nonviolent drug felons too, allowing a very large portion of the country to vote again and regain many rights. Other things he could do are actually push for ending mining/logging on federal land, have the EPA halt all fracking until the chemicals become known, and have the judicial department go wild against all corrupt politicians and fatcats."
dan1pdt,RedBeard94,"I agree with the second paragraph whole-heartedly. I would love to see all of those done. However, I think that if there is any sort of constitutional argument to be made for a decision at all, I think it is worth a try. I am sick of liberal politicians not taking these hail mary decisions and saying ""fuck it"". I wouldn't care a whole lot if a Supreme Court appointment gets overturned, nor do I care if a plan to close Gitmo gets overturned. I want to see him accomplish something and give Republicans things to overturn or otherwise take care of before being able to focus on anything that Trump campaigned on doing. I would love to see Democrats fight dirty a little bit."
damxrw8,Bylth,"So freaking decriminalize it at least. You have the power, Obama."
damy1oa,BanjoPikkr,"Except its not a product like cigarettes or alcohol. It's a plant, it should be treated like wheat or barley or hops."
damybh4,AhriKyuubi,"Cigarette is also made from tobacco plant, it's a plant inside a paper roll"
damyvh0,RedBeard94,"Beer is made from water and plants, like juice. I think the nature of what it does to the body and mind is similar to alcohol, and that is why it should be treated the same as alcohol."
damzkw3,BanjoPikkr,"Cigarette is a product. It's heavily processed and not a plant. Tobacco is a plant, and wheat, and marijuana."
damzn8k,Inkshooter,Opium is also a plant. I think the effects it has on the body are more importanant in judging a substance than where it comes from. And the effects in this case are mild and shouldn't be cause for criminalization.
dan04y8,BanjoPikkr,Opium is not a plant. Poppies are plants. All plants should be absolutely legal.
dan436o,Inkshooter,"At what concentration should the naturally-occurring compenents of the poppy flower stop being legal? How can the plant be legal, but the substance it produces not be?"
daoknb7,BanjoPikkr,"It's not the plants or the compounds that are derived from them that are a problem. In fact, they are all very useful in the right quantity and setting. It is certain people's behavior that is the problem, deal with those people and those problems, don't just eradicate plants or allow only pharmaceutical companies to use, experiment, and sell these compounds. Regardless of all that , everything would sort itself out just fine. As it always does, nature always reaches a balance."
dan17pg,Cascadianranger,"It is different slightly to wheat. It DOES have side effects, although they are minor and mostly annoyances, though the occasional short term memory loss is annoying sometimes. Plus it is smoking so those laws still should apply, don't smoke in public places or whatever laws are in your area Cigarette would be a pretty good comparison and place to start for it."
damykal,ben70,"Well buddy, you had 8 years to do something. You get a small amount of credit for telling dea not to focus on it in legal states, when we had a meth boom and now an opiate boom"
damyoa7,whistleforme,"As usual, a politician coming out of power making statements like this while he had 8 years to do something about it."
damyq6t,Saffuran,"Don't just talk, all you have done is fucking talk. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!You have 4 weeks of big stick wielding left, it's okay to speak softly, but bash some damn heads in to get your point across. You're about to lose your entire legacy to an orangutan, don't scuttle quietly into the night, even if it's only symbolic PLEASE JUST DO SOMETHING, ANYTHING. That goes double for DAPL, President Inaction."
damyvz7,,Orangutan haha
damzlwn,Jabrak,Too bad he isn't in some sort of position where he'd have the power to do that
dan0w3z,gizram84,Yet he did nothing about that for 8 years. He could have rescheduled it. He didn't.
dan0wtj,,How brave to take this stand now...
dan1tci,aramisorwell,He had 8 years
dan22as,Dejahthoris22,Is he stopping the states from legalizing it? That's called incrementalism. That's what center left Democrats do because it's the only way to get things done in our country with both the right and left to compromise between. Extremism on either side accomplishes nothing.
dan34e6,ansmo,Ok... But is he doing anything about? He's still the motherfucking president until January. He's had 8 years and hasn't done shit for legalization. All talk. No action.
daniwqt,HandMeMyThinkingPipe,"The Cole memo prevented enforcement in legal states long enough for those states industries to get a foothold and without it we wouldn't be having this conversation most likely. So, while he could have done more sooner then he did, he did at least do that and helped pave the way to the end of prohibition. Hopefully the trump drug war all stars do the right thing and at the very least leave things how they are."
dan3ion,f0rcedinducti0n,"He had 8 fucking years to get it done, now he opens his mouth in the last 30 days?"
dan3mjj,pepperjohnson,"Day after he leaves office ""We should reroute pipelines"""
dan4yec,,Shame he hasn't been in some position of power for the past 8 years that could have directly influenced some sort of legislation dealing with marijuana.
dan5iem,mom0nga,"This feels like a good time to point out that [Obama was quite the pot-smoker in his high school years as a member of ""The Choom Gang.""](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/obama-and-his-pot-smoking-choom-gang/) His biographer called him a ""pot-smoking innovator"" who created all kinds of different smoking games: in a car with the windows rolled up, intercepting blunts that were being passed around, etc."
dan67n1,Gross_Guy,"Obama, as your final act; legalize it permanently in at least the states that are legal and leaning towards legalization now. The stigma against marijuana needs to stop and the benefits need to be acknowledged properly and made iron clad, so it can't be revoked in a month or so by the incoming ""government""."
dan7ynw,sustainably_extinct,"This infuriates me. This is why Clinton lost.MJ legalization was overwhelmingly the top issue discussed on his web site in 2008. His DNC cabinet brushed it off as ""just a few internet weirdos"". States are taking matters into their own hands to legalize it left and right. And he COULD HAVE settled the matter by getting it rescheduled. And for 8 years he fucking sat on his thumb on this issue. MEANWHILE: people are going to jail, having their lives ruined, GETTING MURDERED BY POLICE.This is why Clinton lost. People don't trust the DNC to stand up for their rights anymore."
daniwkg,derekd223,And they are correct
dan85hf,Lebowski_Rams,Except cigarettes and alcohol should be treated way more strictly than marijuana
danahbd,Panaran,Yet he made absolutely no legit effort to legalize it.
danicc0,HandMeMyThinkingPipe,"The Cole memo prevented enforcement in legal states long enough for those states industries to get a foothold and without it we wouldn't be having this conversation most likely.

damp48n,skunkmoor,"He absolutely will be confirmed and he absolutely go after it. It has been one of his pet agendas for decades, alongside his business interests in private prisons. The trump appointments have demonstrated clear intent to pursue any means of turning a quick buck for their donors at the expense of everything else. Don't kid yourself; we will see raids on legal shops by the end of 2017, and the industry will collapse entirely by 2018, and likely won't be coming back in our lifetimes."
damly46,FishAndRiceKeks,Cigarettes should be treated like marijuana was in the past. Let's just trade their places.

dampl53,poopdeck,I'm offended. Sike i'm not.
dameimd,Allyanna,"Pretty big words coming from a hypocrite that does nothing throughout his presidency to legalize it. The president doesn't even need Congressional approval to declassify marijuana as a controlled substance. He has the ability to do so on a federal level. I might even admire him for doing something like that before he left. Very doubtful though, he is all talk."
dammj7k,bananarammer6969,His administration did put a moratorium on dea busts in legal states so it's not like he did nothing
dampvys,ireallydislikepolice,And before that he busted more dispensaries than Bush. Obama hasn't done anything substantive to support legalization other than waffling for years about how to treat dispensaries.
damsets,qasem01,> it's not like he did nothingIs this seriously the fucking standard we're holding our presidents to now?Edit: Grammar
damecm4,OptimalCentrix,Too bad our next Attorney General doesn't feel the same way. Whether he'll take a states rights approach to it is anyone's guess.
damitke,Ninwa,The good news is republicans are all about state's rights and smaller government. Surely they wouldn't overturn the decisions of several states who have already legalized it?
dammtwj,40kfreak,except their voters need big government to remain alive so its quite a conundrum for them

He's a lame duck(this part isn't really his fault) and his word has meant next to nothing for nearly 6 years. If he actually wanted to fix the state/fed weed issue then he would've done something when he had political capital and seats in congress to do so. He didn't, and he never planned to."

damf8nk,anonuisance,"He could technically order the departments responsible to do it, but that would be a bit like ordering the Attorney General to prosecute some political enemy: executive overreach."
dammqkd,BoojumG,Like Obama had any problem with that before.
damfv1v,noelsusman,">“Look, I've been very clear about my belief that we should try to discourage substance abuse,” Obama said. “And I am not somebody who believes that legalization is a panacea. But I do believe that treating this as a public-health issue, the same way we do with cigarettes or alcohol, is the much smarter way to deal with it.”He said the same thing to Bill Maher a few weeks ago, and I believe he said basically the same thing years ago. He's also sticking with this line:>“Typically how these classifications are changed are not done by presidential edict,” he said, “but are done either legislatively or through the DEA. As you might imagine, the DEA, whose job it is historically to enforce drug laws, is not always going to be on the cutting edge about these issues.”which is a bit rich considering how liberal he's been with executive authority over the last 2-3 years."

damjlpb,ktchong,"Donald Trump has promised he will reversed all of Obama's executive orders when he takes office. So, even if Obama uses an executive order to decriminalize marijuana, the decriminalization will last for about a month."
damqptb,blissplus,Well. If Trump has promised something then that definitely settles it.?
damhu9d,uniqname99,Oh now he says this lol

Had he passed legalization in his first two years (or tried and failed), the shellacking he took for passing Health Care would have seemed like a pillow fight. Romney campaigned against Obama for ""Chicago style politics"". Can you imagine the dog whistling that the GOP could have done if the first black president was for legalizing pot?It's easy to forget how far we have come on the issue. California, one of the most progressive states in the country, rejected legalization by proposition in 2010 by 53.5-46.5 percent. Six years, we legalized it (starting in 2018) by 56-44 percent. That's such a big swing. It wouldnt have had support in California in 2009. It definitely wouldnt have had support in Arkansas in 2009. And he would have needed democratic senators in Arkanas, Nebraska, and Missouri in order to pass lasting change.What reality do you have to be in to think that this would have been a good idea for Obama 8 years ago?"

damq0qu,thetemple,"I live in Maryland where weed was decrimminalized a little while ago. I got pulled over last Friday over a burnt out headlight. I had Marijuana in the car. When the officer came to the window he added, ""hand over whatever Marijuana you have, it reeks in the car."" I complied and he didn't charge me for it. Maybe it was the area I live in, maybe it's because I'm white, but I think slowly but surely we'll come to a consensus as a country that we can put the past laws behind us and end this injustice be over and done with. I will note that I got charged for driving with a suspended registration, my car did get towed so I was still fucked in the end, but the Marijuana wasn't a huge concern for the officer."

It takes away my anxiety, of which I have a lot of, and it does the same for my brother. I also live in Texas. BUT I am not in favor of allowing for the already-overreaching government power of ANY branch to meddle in the lives of milions. It establishes a precedent that can later be used by those in office who do not favor your agenda. (Start thinking long-term).Leave it to the states."

damqgav,naterstwilly,Just hollow words at this point. What actions can he take to make it so?
damqgq4,GifACatBytheToe,real trailblazer this guy is.
damqgz7,Johnisfaster,Or you could treat it like something that isn't deadly.
damqhjw,DDuub,Everyone who supports legalization or decriminalization should be very afraid that Jeff Sessions is going to be the next Attorney General. The Attorney General oversees the DEA and can set enforcement priorities. All of the state level progress is at serious risk.

damqjf9,dawgz525,"Well then fucking do something about it! I've waited 8 years for this statement, now do something, anything on your way out the door. Barry plz."

damqtuq,DudeNiceMARMOT,Oh really? Did you spend the last 7.9 years pondering this one Obama?
damqv5c,octopussy_,Obama probably staying in DC after he leaves the White House just because marijuana is legal in DC. After the past 8 years this dude has endured he deserves to smoke a bowl or two. I see you Obama.
damqz67,i_smart,"He's just jumping on the band wagon now. He was a TERRIBLE president for all 8 years on marijuana reform. Launched more federal crack downs than Bush, even after he explicitly said that's what he wouldn't do when seeking election. Bill Clinton pulled this shit too! Ripped apart more families for drug related crimes with shitty policies, gets out of office, says he thinks weed should be legal. Well, Bill and Obama, if only you were ever in a position to bring about the change you're talking about..."
damr1kw,TrumpTheRecord,"Now he just needs to deny the DAPL, sit back, and watch the RNC implode under the wanning internal pressure because fractured alliances and external pressure because veterans that understand what sovereignty means and how bureaucratic navigation can screw people out of that from which they should be exempt. It really is a beautiful scenerio. Trump will have to divest from the pipeline without shorting and explain why he did not do so earlier if he allows the cessation to continue, explain how even in a blind trust reopening the pipeline serves future jobs more than renewables would in terms of long-term sustainability, explain why he was always against it even though he's invested into it in the first place, or best of all explain how continued and expedited oil consumption is great for the planet and America."
damr2st,jphert12,If only there was somebody with a lot of power that could do something about it.
damr3dx,Thr33St0r13s,"Oh wow, now he takes a stance. I'm sure all the people jailed over the last eight years are fucking stoked. Nobody is forgetting he made zero moves for eight years."
damr48p,Dharma_initiative1,"Then why the fuck did you appoint a Republican head of DEA that is staunchly against weed and views it in the same tier as Meth and Heroin?These are empty words to me. Now isn't the time to be making sweeping and revolutionary political statements Obama, you had 8 years to fucking do that."
damraj8,MADEmattEB,I say marijuana should be treated like...marijuana.

damruev,ALABAMA_FRONT_BUTT,As he's on his way out of course he feels this way. What a fucking travesty of a presidency the last 8 years have been.
dams0w3,Left-Coast-Voter,"I would argue you could do that same for any ""drug"" and then take the money you spend on law enforcement in the drug war and spend it on health care. Portugal is great example of how this can be successful."
dams3un,geetarzrkool,"Gee, if only he had been in a position to actually do something about it for the last 8 years :/"
dams4i8,Mattakusisgreatness,So do something about it.
dams5f3,Flubbies,He thought the same 8 years ago and has done nothing. All talk.

damsd6k,hitlerswag420,"He has always believed this, but because he is a fake ass politician, he had to have a public opinion and a private opinion. He doesn't give a shit about the millions of human beings locked in cages for smoking weed. He only cares about his public image and political career."
damsfmm,8-bit-eyes,Then why didn't he do anything about it?
damsfrk,hyperinfinity11,"He's had eight years to push for this and he did nothing. A little late now. Now we get at least four years of ""marijuana is a gateway drug"" bullshit."
damslbw,AppleJuiceCyder,It's funny because cigarettes and alcohol are sooo much more deadly too
damsmmo,Simplyx69,"So why then did he not pursue that? Sure, he'd have met resistance with the Republican Congress, but he didn't even try."
damsnxt,OceanOG,Sounds like something we should tell the president!
damsodn,Botch_Lobotomy,"Couldn't legalizing weed be a potential silver bullet for Trump's campaign promises? It would reduce crime rate, increase local jobs, win over lib/dems, raise huge taxes, wipe Mexican drug cartels and instantly make him the most popular president ever."
damsrtj,PurpleZerg,I would unfilter r/the_donald if he did.
damsole,Dontgiveafuckchuck,Fact - he had 8 years to do it and didnt. Now puts the blame on Trump to divide the sides even more.
damssd6,Keyboard_Mouseketeer,But during his 8 years in office he stayed loyal to the pharm industry and did nothing to legalize it on a federal level. Now wants to be praised. Narcissist.
damtxx3,,[deleted]
damxlil,Keyboard_Mouseketeer,"> the pharmaceutical would love it too be legal,I stopped reading after that. Im for opposing views but I just couldnt read after that."
damsssx,commandersteel,Then do something about it Mr. President.
damsuam,,and yet 8 years in power and Obama did nothing about it.
damsx3y,RealityIsMyReligion,"Legally speaking, yes, but in terms of personal responsibility, please treat marijuana like hard alcohol, not like cigarettes.You shouldn't be stepping outside 4 times a day at work to smoke weed, just like you shouldn't be taking shots at the bar during your lunch break. Of if you do, make sure you're aware of what the fuck you're doing for the rest of your workday. Don't get stoned before meeting with investors, for example (unless they're cannabis industry investors, in which case, make sure to share)."
damsx4u,312chiraq,He's doing a lot of talking on his way out the door....he had 8 fucking years to get something done at the federal level

damtdvn,Mr_Miggie,"Now you wanna say that, cmon should have done it before."
damteme,,"Gee, if only he could do something about it. Oh well, it's not like he's the most powerful man on earth."
damtjb7,,Thanks mr obama for handing the ability to kill or detain citizens indefinitely without trial and access to every google search and text message they've ever sent to a fucking wannabe despot
damu2xg,ESPN_outsider,It would have been great if he had that stance when it actually mattered. I swear this guy's whole presidency was saying he supports one thing only to do nothing when it could matter.
damua47,,Well he had 8 years to do something about it but instead we armed ISIS and raised my healthcare costs
damub9p,kawow02,This bitch had 8 years to do something about it.
damud46,Nostrometheus,He had 8 years to do something about it.
damudsj,Lo0seR,Shoulda coulda woulda
damuua4,onehaz,What's new here? He will not do anything about it so who cares what he thinks at this point
damuzqh,,Saying this at the end of his 8 years? lol what a joke of a president
damv5vg,xproofx,I disagree. Cigarettes and alcohol are worse than marijuana.
damv9zh,WizardOfTheWastes,So whatcha gonna do? Nothing.
damvaj2,TheOfficialJoeBiden,"That's even a little harsh. Cigarettes and alcohol take thousands of lives every year, marijuana doesn't."
damvbna,Ba11e,"Oh shut up. You had 8 years to change that in this country and you didn't. And now, with a month and a half left in his presidency, he's talking about it? What a joke."

damvgkf,toddozie,"Too late, Barry"
damviuj,80BAIT08,Bit late tbh.
damvlpc,designerdad,Well then he should have done something about it 8 years ago.
damvpco,another_communist,Someone should remind him that he has quite a bit of power and influence of that. Why is he telling us? Tell his employees
damvqj8,kawow02,Obama's legacy: banker's pet.
damvy86,ELI3k,Except he had 8 years to do just that. Too bad the Alcohol and Pharmaceutical industries would never allow him to do it.
damvz44,moleratical,"you had 8 years dude, and you have about 1 1/2 months left. There is still time to try and get something but I suggest you just reschedule."
damw4bc,glbz187,You had 8 years mate.
damw4if,tge90,Didn't he have 8yrs to make this happen?
damw5hx,sirenbrian,"If only he was in a position to do something about it, huh?"
damw7uq,Kaneshadow,He's getting awful lippy now that he has virtually no power. It woulda been neat if he stood up to his bosses while he could still actually do something about it.
damw868,aikodude,"well gee, if only someone with a little power could make that happen..."
damwp22,Plettez,Yet it's still been illegal his entire term. Good job Obama.
damwyad,meatboitantan,"So why has he spent the past 8 years being a fuckhead and doing nothing about it? This is last minute Dem-Party saving face. Shut the hell up Barack, you've wasted my time."
damx1s4,server_busy,Thanks Mr. Month and a Half left to matter
damx39w,vincekerrazzi,Executive order. Do it.
damx4gf,kekehippo,It's nice that he feels that way but as a lame duck president it's probably not gonna happen for another 16 years or so.
damx5g0,funke75,I kind of feel like he had his chance
damx68c,FukboiMarvi,"""I'm on my way out of office and I want to improve my ratings"""

Fuck this government and fuck this god forsaken planet morty. But you know what I always say morty. That's the waaaaaayyyyyyy the news goes."
damx89q,MilkHS,Then he should have done ANYTHING to further that agenda while he was president.
damxeo6,MongoJazzy,"he didn't want to do ANYTHING, he just wants to make meaningless statements."
damx9kw,Lazerspewpew,8 years too late. That's the best we can hope for from American bureaucracy
damxhyb,neurolux,"Then on your last day, sign and executive order legalizing it."
damzmwm,RedBeard94,Why his last day? Why not tomorrow?
dan0ssu,neurolux,I'll send him a text telling him to do it right now.
dan1j35,RedBeard94,"Oh, I was just planning on going in to visit in an hour or so."
dan1zls,neurolux,me and him are smoking a blunt right now and discussing it. he is trying to figure out where to sign.
dan3lf5,RedBeard94,Is he so high right now that he can't find the signature line? You guys sure party hard! I can't wait to get there!
damxipo,fuck_fraud,"So do something about it, jabroney."
damxlz7,AwesomeberryJam,Maybe he should have done something about it in his 8 years as president
damxn92,cobalt_coyote,Eight years in office and this just now occurs to him.
damxoqv,OkAlrightIGetIt,About 8 years too late there Mr O
damxp37,Lithgow42023,"Now he says this. OK. Reddit loves Obama. He can do no wrong. This is a good thing. He's right. This is a good thing. This is the most wonderful thing ever. Obama wants to legalize weed! He is so cool. I wish we could just forget that racist old constitution and make him president for life! /s He's a washed up politician. He's afraid that people won't pay attention to him anymore and won't love him and shower him with praise and adoration. Does anybody have an idea how many people have gone to jail or been fined, fired or had their lives otherwise ruined because he didn't have the huevos to say this eight years ago or even one year ago? This stinks like rotten meat and I'm the only one who is going to call him out on this shit. Now get me my downvotes bitches! Bring them all! Then ban me from this sub for blasphemy!"
damzcqa,RedBeard94,"I have seen ""too damn late"" or ""8 years too late"" or other comments like that more than any other comment on here. You are absolutely not the only one who feels this way. Sure, he made a comment that he has not imperative to keep because he made it less than 2 months before leaving office, but you are not the only person disappointed/angry that he didn't do something sooner.You can come down from the pedestal you have put yourself on and actually add something productive to the discussion rather than complaining like a child if you would like."
dan002y,Lithgow42023,You were right. I was wrong. I read those comments right after I posted mine. Not what I expected at all. Pedestal? I don't get it. You still downvoted me right?
dan16cy,RedBeard94,"I don't think I downvoted. I am not sure I voted either way. I got a bit worked up and maybe overreacted to what you said. And now after you recognized what was going on, it was definitely a step or two too far. Part of it is that I am also upset that Obama has only played lip service to a bunch of stuff, and I really just want to see him go wild the unilateral action to do everything even possibly justified to be unilatererally done so that he can accomplish what he wants."
damxq9c,saippua,"Dontcha think its interesting how all the rational opinions always surface at the end of someones political term, when they're just words."
damxqoz,CswBizzel,Why has he waited until the end of his presidency to say this?
damxs2j,xXSoroxXx,Everyone bashing the president for not doing anything should also remember that he's the first black president. The first black president and then he legalizes marijuana? Hmmmm
damz3q5,RedBeard94,He has also had a historically uncooperative congress hellbent on making him look as unproductive and awful as possible.
damxsw6,brostitosNdip,Would have been nice to have heard this 8 years ago.
damxwe4,CornDoggyStyle,Very good. Any chance of federal legalization before he's out?
damxy3q,robmak3,"He waits to the end of his term to say this. Or should I say he just wants to be some sort of ""liberal"" pundit on TV when he gets out of office."
damxyft,VikesonmyNikes,Yet he didnt do anything about it while he was in office

damy2a7,Concrete_Mattress,Would've been nice if he'd spoken up about it anytime up 'till now.
damybdr,bushrod,Legalization of marijuana would be a stellar way to end 2016.
damych8,ColWalterKurtz,Yet you let the dea keep it at a schedule 1 controlled substance.

dan04ts,ilivehalo,Barack 'all talk' Obama
dan0bji,servvits_ban_boner,Well he waited long enough.
dan0hmr,JabberJaahs,He had 8 years to make it happen so just how credible is his statement?
dan0lbh,sethu2,He had 8 freaking years as President and thought to bring it up in the last freaking month?
dan0mnn,tablepancake,Why didn't he come to this conclusion 8 years ago?
dan0svj,lincolndnl8,Well he didn't do a damn thing about it while he could!
dan0xw3,Recl,Cheap talk. He had 8 years to do something about it.
dan18ha,everythingsadream,"So why don't you do something about it then? Ohhhh that's right, Obama just wants to go out on a good note. F that. Executive order that or don't talk."
dan1myb,Crocodxle,"Man, why does he say this right at the very end of his presidency? Could've done with this like literally any other time in the last 8 years."
dan1zjn,GloriousGardener,"lol. Obama should maybe have tried to legalize it in the last 8 years, now whens hes got one foot out the door, hes going to try and say shit like this? Makes him look completely disingenuous. I guess he already opened that door when he started openly campaigning for clinton, something sitting presidents normally don't do, and certainly don't do after publicly shit talking the fuck out of the same candidate during their previous primaries. History is not going to remember this man kindly. GOP blocking his legislative agenda aside, he ran on a promise of running a transparent government and hes done wonders in the opposite direction. Just seems very phony after all is said and done. The president that was so effective the people of america actually replaced him with trump hoping for better. Quite the legacy."
dan26s9,wowasg,YOU HAD 8 YEARS!!!!
dan2cz2,Dejahthoris22,"Do none of you people know how our Government works? A President CAN'T present a bill or make it legal with an executive order!!

It's up to ALL OF YOU to vote for representatives who agree with your veiwpoint on policies. Please, take it upon yourselves to learn something about the basics of government. These comments are embarrassing."
dan3a58,ZeroSumHappiness,What he can do is direct the DEA to research possible re-scheduling of marijuana based on both novel medical use research in progress and its lack of potential for abuse.
dan5o4i,EsportsLottery,"Federal government controls all of this, aka scheduling of Marijuana and enforcement. It's literally all in his power."
danfpnm,Dejahthoris22,The Goverment has three branches. The president is not the federal government.

If I want to get plugged in my male ass while cleaning my gun with a blunt in my mouth, it should be my freedom to do so! These are the ideals that the GOP was founded on. The right aligning themselves with the radical Christian right has been their worst mistake. Dems shouldn't have to be the party to enforce individual freedoms, such as smoking weed. Doing what you want with your property(body included) is kindve the whole thing as far as the Republican ideology goes.

Wait so you can lament and say more stuff without making any changes? How big of you.Way to ignore all those people rotting in prison Obama, seriously thanks. Way to ignore all those people who are not in pro-medical states that believe it helps them out one way or another, seriously thanks. Way to ignore all those people who believe it is their right to alter their consciousness as long as they don't hurt anyone else, seriously thanks.Obama is a coward."

dan99ic,Xacebop,He had 8 years to do something about this. States have made it clear that they want to overrule the government and its only a matter of time before all the money were spending could be money earned. If anyone's gonna notice this it's going to be trump
dan9htz,Demonace34,Everyone in here is thinking short term. Obama doesn't want to piss off the people who actually vote and screw his own party over. This isn't the fault of Obama...it is the fault of young people who don't vote and expect leaders to carry out something that won't get them or their party reelected. Atleast he is trying to get the ball rolling.

danabne,goonscape,that's interesting because americans think president obama should be treated like a baboon

daog4yq,HandMeMyThinkingPipe,Since the Cole memo and the rider on the appropriations bill there has been very few raid if any. There was at the start of his presidency for sure but to claim it's the Wild West or something is ignoring reality.

dancblh,Keyboard_Mouseketeer,Obama's had the power and influence to do it in his 8 years of office and he stayed a loyal puppet to the pharm industry which has created the heroin epidemic as well as so many evil things in the past. Hes just a narcissist worried about his legacy who like Hillary will say anything and do nothing.

danjqvm,bicameral_mind,"Say what you want about Obama's actions on this issue, but it's a significant thing that the sitting president of the US just said this. I know a lot of people on Reddit think this issue is just settled and the answer is obvious, but 8 years ago it was pretty unimaginable the president would speak out in favor of legalization."
dankifj,ntvirtue,He could have removed it from the controlled substances list with the stroke of his pen at any time....he is LYING
dausycn,emperorhirohito,Bit late for that isn't it?
dauwsma,,Once again Obama shows his ignorance in all it's embarrassing light.
damhu9l,baphometsayshi,i'm sure marijuana proponents love the fact that he waited until the very end of his term to say this and only after a few states passed legal use laws (par for the course for democrats).

damm7g0,zombiemakemelol,"It's a 2 way street, he didn't exactly work with republicans either, there was no give and take the last 8 years. Congress gridlocked along party lines and when Obama had his majority he rammed through legislation that republicans had no say in. So guess what happened? Republicans were pissed and petty and refused to work with Obama just as Obama had refused to work with him."
dammm6m,EL_YAY,You're kidding right? Obama tried reaching across the aisle to work with them time and time again. Once the republicans had the majority they just said nope not even gonna negotiate. This is common knowledge.Edit: spelling police are out in force.

damspb3,EL_YAY,"He genuinely did. Republicans refused to even engage in negotiation with him. Also the type of response you just gave is exactly what I've been talking about in other parts of Reddit today. Saying ""ahaha"" in all caps ands stuff like that shuts down actual discourse."
damw1v8,TGiddy,"Republicans have said it from the start. They will stop anything they can so Obama, and the Democrats, will look bad. It's not about making the country better. It's about which party ""wins"". It's quite pathetic."

damw7zt,TGiddy,Nope you're wrong sorry. Look it up please.
damws34,,is that what you say when you lose arguments?
dammque,Maugetarr,"This is actually pretty insightful in my opinion. It's often overlooked that the Legislative and Executive branches are supposed to be co-equal. Arguments could be made that Republicans stopped him from making changes that he wanted to, and at the same time it could be said that he stopped changes Republicans wanted to make."
damntwz,zombiemakemelol,"Which is the way our government is designed; congress has to really want something and agree to actually get things done. This is why we have fiscal cliffs all the time, they can't even agree to fund themselves until the last possible second. In theory this is supposed to keep government smaller and stop legislation that is unpopular since it has so many ways to be shot down. This doesn't always happen, and obviously creates it's own set of problems."
damlioq,_Born_To_Be_Mild_,I don't think it is or should be at his level. I reckon he really thinks about what he says in public.
damnit3,,It takes a lot of balls to come out and say you're on the same side of an issue as the majority of Americans.

damuy5d,e-guy,"haha, yeah, it's not like there's anything the commander in chief and leader of the executive branch and associated agencies could have done to, say, immediately halt all raids, declassify it as a highly dangerous drug, and fully endorse state sovereignty when it comes to legalization.Oh...."

Just my two cents."
dan2fmx,PM_ME_YOUR_HAIRYBITS,"He didn't. But he has been commuting hundreds of nonviolent drug sentences.He could have done a lot but it never really was his way to force social change.

dan7f6g,Inkshooter,"> How is it not relevant? The pollsters who said hilliary would be the next president were flat out wrong. Now, you have the same style of polling/people saying obama's approval rating is skyrocketing?Apples and oranges. They're both essentially surveys, but that's where the similarities end. The polls NEVER said Hillary would be the next president, they simply implied that, out of the thousands of people phoned, a slight majority were voting for Clinton. Those numbers were then extrapolated for the entire country.>I highly doubt those are the real approval numbers, more like some propaganda to make obama look good before he's out of office.Approval ratings for presidents often spike towards the end of their presidency.

Every poll said President Elect Trump was going to lose, most said by a large margin,No, the poll AGGREGATORS, models that combined all the polls into one, all said Trump would probabaly lose. Plenty of polls showed better results for Trump. LA Times had him with higher poll numbers throughout the entire election cycle. The fact that there was so much variation in the polls meant that Trump always had a chance, and Nate Silver included this chance in his model.>yet he won by a LANDSLIDE.It was a very close race, and he lost the popular vote. It was even closer than 2000.>Once you take away all the DEAD and ILLEGAL votes from hilliary, he won the popular vote by a LANDSLIDE as well.Oh, boy. Do you have any proof that this is true? There was only one documented case of fraud in the entire election, even with Trump's 'poll watchers', and it was a Trump voter.>Pollsters are not fortune tellers, you're right.

damu7vm,,"So we're just going to sit here and pretend that he didn't have two years with full control of the house and senate to repeal all the unconstitutional federal prohibitions on marijuana? If he really thought it should be treated like cigarettes and alcohol, it would have behooved him to encourage congress to bring marijuana reform laws to his desk and sign them. But that didn't happen. Between 1996 and 2013, the federal government conducted 528 dispensary raids on medical marijuana dispensaries.During Obama's first term as president, his administration oversaw 270 dispensary raids on medical marijuana dispensaries.Between 2009 and 2013, President Obama's administration spent $100 million more cracking down on medical marijuana dispensaries than George W. Bush's did.“I never made a commitment that somehow we were going to give carte blanche to large-scale producers and operators of marijuana—and the reason is because it's against federal law.” - Obama He's full of it, and he's only just now saying this so people think he is somehow pro-legalization when in reality he was not. Even though Trump's AG pick hates marijuana, Trump has implied that issues like these are not federal issues and should be left up to each state as the 10th amendment implies. It would be interesting if Trump was the president who finally nullified all the unconstitutional federal laws. I'm doubtful, but who knows. Hopefully more sensible libertarianish politicians like Rand Paul are within earshot of Trump. On a side note, I personally don't do marijuana and tend to avoid people who do, but it definitely SHOULD NOT be a federal issue. It is a state's rights issue. Marijuana is the perfect litmus test for seeing who supports the constitution and who doesn't. Any Republican who says they support the constitution, but also believes marijuana should be a federal issue is full of shit, much like the Democrats who claim to support the constitution and also hold the view that the federal government has the authority to regulate incandescent lightbulbs or firearms."

daml4w5,nerdyintentions,That wouldn't be a bad thing. Its not guaranteed that Trump would repeal it. And it would kind of force Trump to deal with it instead of kicking the can down the road (like Obama admittedly did). There might be political backlash if he decided to repeal it and so he'd have to weigh the pros and cons. But if it is re-scheduled and the sky doesn't fall (it won't) then I believe Trump would be likely to just leave well enough alone.
damld4d,upthatknowledge,Pence wont leave it alone. That Theocrat will crusade on this issue
damloc2,nerdyintentions,"Even if they repeal, it could still be good. For instance, if there was a big enough outcry, it would set the stage for the 2020 Democratic nominee (as well as all down ballot Democrats) to make re-scheduling/legalization a campaign issue.You might actually get some Congressional movement on it which is much better than an executive order anyway."

damm0ru,nerdyintentions,The President can suggest or propose legislation but it has to be introduced by a member of Congress and then make it through committee before it could go to a floor vote.

If enough States pass legalization laws only then will the Feds get involved and really, you don't want the how the Feds are treating cigarettes to come down on marijuana. Look at the vaping industry where FDA is going to strangle the industry in its infancy with overregulation.

damlrgg,Sabiancym,"Legally he can declassify it, which would essentially make it legal, but people already hate on him for his executive orders. It's probably better if it just goes through congress. To make it 100% completely legal in the entire U.S. we need it to be completely unscheduled federally as well as get every state to legalize it. If the fed legalizes it's highly likely that most states would as well, but there might be a few stubborn states."

damkyph,lionseatcake,"Im getting to the point, after spending my late teens and early twenties all uppity for marijuana activism, to where im like, who cares what people say?!?! Obama 'saying' something to me is the same thing as russell crowe or kim kardashian saying something. Passing legislation has absolutely nothing to do with what people in the political sohere outside of congress SAY. Its going to happen. Back in 2000 or even 2005, yeah, it was reassuring to hear someone famous say that it should b legal, but now we have so many states with ""medical"" legalized, which in most places means its legal for a fee, and even recreationally legal in a few other states. This is the win. This kind of legislation is all that will change things. x Not obama saying blah blah blaaaah."
daml4n9,sbroll,Is there still time for him to legalize it across the country?
damlh6l,mastaxn,"Yes, in the literal sense. Congress just returned from recess. But, in the practical sense, no. They'd have to get a bill through both chambers before Jan. 19th.

dammban,Bahmerman,"Doesn't Colorado have at least 3 or 4 years of empiracle data that proves this to be true? When they motioned to be a trial state for legalizing Marijuana they paid close attention to the effect it had on the economy and crime and traffic accidents. The sales tax generated approx. $936,682 for local municipalities according to [Colorado's Dept of Revenue](http://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/marijuana-tax-data-archive)). According to the [Drug Policy Alliance](http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Colorado_Marijuana_Legalization_One_Year_Status_Rport.pdf) (you can take this with a grain of salt but it checks out with Colorado's official numbers), I think to date it allowed Colorado to set aside $2.5 million to increase the number of health professionals in Colorado public schools.I can't recall the crime statistics but there was no correlation to marijuana or they had no possible way to accurately determine marijuana was the cause.As for traffic incidents, According to [Colorado's Department of Transportation](https://www.codot.gov/safety/safety-data-sources-information) they were as low as they have ever been since 2008, last I checked it was rising a little to date but still well below previous years when marijuana was illegal. I think there were some years that were lower but I don't think enough to warrant marijuana as the cause.TL;DR Colorado has years of empiracle evidence stating marijuana can in fact generate money through sales tax and poses no substantial risk to drivers.*EDIT:went to fix some links as best I could, I pulled them from a paper I did maybe a 6 months to a year ago and I guess my APA format was either botched or...whatever)*"

These aren't the type of issues for which one develops an opinion over time, either you're for it or against it. Also, the excuse that the country wasn't prepared to hear these opinions, especially in the case of gay marriage, before he announced his support, just doesn't fly for me."

Pretty sure only around half the states have done it to some extent which isn't nearly enough.Not much time for him to get on it though, so nothing will happen on a nation wide level and the next administration sure as hell won't make it happen."
damop5k,DarthRusty,He plans on doing something about it as a private citizen. If only he were someday allowed to hold a position in govt that would grant him the power to do more than a private citizen. One can dream.
damopbi,,So why doesn't he issue an executive order?
damopbn,tshep16,You had eight years to say this. I'm glad it's on the table but God damn.
damopc6,O_R,"He has the power to change it too. Deschedule marijuana. OR remove it entirely. I want the CSA to put up to constitutional review. It's unconstitutional in my opinion. They say they derive the power from the interstate commerce clause. Bullshit. Intrastate if I've ever seen it. It required two amendments to do this to alcohol, we shouldn't let Nixon's pro-war agenda from fucking 1970 permeate through our society illegally and without end. But, no one has raised the issue directly so it's only been tangentially reviewed as a component of other cases.I'm hoping myself that Obama's last action as President is to address this. Removes marijuana from the CSA or otherwise deschedules it, ""smoke weed everyday"" mic drop, drives off into the sunset with Snoop Dogg, ""see ya."""
damoqda,Lifeform604,"Heavily regulated, vilified, and taxed to a ridiculously punitive degree?"
damowqd,,Yes!
damoqt6,vanderthot,I love this man so much
damou9m,aciolan,"It actually is, for normal people which want to use it in controlled situations in an recreational environment. But not everybody can handle themselves and can become a problem...This is happening anyway even with it being illegal; no need to encourage it."
damp6z6,WhiskeyHoliday,"For your last sentence, I think you echo a lot of people on the pro-legalize sentiments but reach the opposite conclusion. Only have to think back to prohibition.How many drunken car accidents do we have per year? How many barroom brawls? How many people sit down in AA meetings every week?You'll always have potheads, whether it's legal or not, but if it's legal at least its sale will be controlled and regulated by the government, taxes will be taken on it, its purchase will no longer support criminal enterprises, and it won't put otherwise innocent people in jail. If someone gets caught driving under the influence of marijuana, or is publicly inebriated, etc. they'll be appropriately punished, but we won't put a kid in jail for years since they got pulled over with a grinder in their backseat."
damqekx,aciolan,"You are right in the arguments you give and I'm sure (by the way you express youreself) that you can understand and accept also the counter-arguements to this.The fact is that right now, marijuana is considered as a cool thing to do, even promoted in the media (cool guys from movies).Also a fact is that a lot of people, not only the US, are smoking it in recreational context. Many ages, without being an issue for society and functioning normal.Now, why do these people, the new generation, the educated, the ones doing it with only creating chills and funs, have to struggle with the dealers and be with one foot in the illegal business when making the aquisition, possesion of just keeping it for holiday season??? I get it, and I'm sure many are.It's a good political tool right now, which moves voters... this I also get it.We know that it's easy for kids to get alcohool and cigaretts. Just get some courage, go to the closest shop next to school and invite your friends to have a nice time and show them the cool.They can do this also with pot. But a little bit *harder* due to the law.Again, in uni, there are kids which really are searching for themselves, smart but in a moment of lost.They can really make an addiction to it and make this have a footprint on their whole life.Of course they can get it anyway, like boose or cigaretts, but why make it so easy for them. Maybe some of them are to shy to make the buy. Or just don't want to risk. Maybe it's worth it for the 1 in 10k.Sorry for the long post. I don't really want to prove a point just to express my thinking.Maybe I did it okay. as an disclaimer I'm also an consumer of this 3 products, I work and have a normal life, I really see a difference between recreation and real life but I also try to keep the open eye to reality;Of course it would be easier for me to just get it from the corner shop."
damrqmd,WhiskeyHoliday,"I can definitely understand not wanting to get impressionable children with developing minds hooked on marijuana.I do think that many people who are pro-legalization would say that making it legal would make it harder for kids to acquire: safe, convenient, affordable, legal marijuana drives out dealers, and if marijuana were legal only for 21+, it would mean that kids would be locked out more than if they could go to their high school friend who deals. I was ""lucky"" enough to go to college in a city where I could get six-packs at 18 while looking 15 from the local bodega, but for most kids getting pot is easier right now than getting alcohol and cigarettes.The ""cool"" factor of marijuana is also enhanced a bit by being illegal, wouldn't you think? If you get it from a drug store and a surly middle-aged-woman puts it in a Thanks For Shopping With Us bag under the harsh flourescent light, it's just another mood-alterant they bought with their six-pack and sponges and toilet paper.Additionally, if they're getting it from their dealer, it *might* end up being the kind of gateway drug the government warned us about back in the day for some kids, if their dealer is also holding stronger drugs. Maybe some of those kid dealers end up in situations over their heads when they buy from larger, more nefarious suppliers. If we save some of *those* kids, maybe it's worth the risk as well.It seems to boil down for me that if kids want it badly enough, they're going to get it, but we can at least regulate it, normalize it, tax it, ensure that it's a high-quality product and make the experience safer for everyone. From the pro-legal standpoint it almost seems like a staggeringly easy decision: less people in prisons, more money for the government and corporations, lower crime, lower child pot usage and more convenient and safe for your average joe-schmo has-a-puff-before-dinner pot user."
damtiu5,aciolan,"Considering the facts presented by you here are real, I must say that I am convinced.Thanks for the healthy conversation!Education, this is what we all need. In as many fields as possible and the information to be kept as updated as possible.Fun fact: in Swiss when there are big festivals (such as techno/electro music, only for example) there are boutiques from the police where participants can learn about on how to spot real drugs from fake drugs. They know it's going to happen. They want it to have the lowest health impact possible."
damoxwm,ratedsar,> This is happening anyway even with it being illegal; no need to encourage it.Tell that to 12.4% of inmates
damqkae,aciolan,"I'm really sorry for some of them. I really do feel like that.The fact is that they were handling something which is illegal.Also another fact is that there are many kids which end up in jail, essentiali ruining their life, for a stupid thing like possesion for personal use.The law is stupid sometimes."

damrikp,Zepplin01,Fuck Obama but he's right here.
damring,Wilbo_Waggins,My tiny sliver of hope with an otherwise terrifying Trump presidency is that he'll look at the issue from a business perspective rather than let his cabinet tell him what to do. He has a consistent history of doing what he wants in the face of strong opposition; so seeing the economic implications of prohibition vs decriminalization vs regulated legalization might trigger him to act alone.At least where I live in a part of Virginia in which A LOT of rednecks smoke A LOT of weed. The vast majority of dealers in the area are some middle aged or old white guys operating out of a trailer littered in Trump/Pence campaign signs.
damrj46,TheSystemShock,"Gotta say, I don't like Obama but this is do agree witb."
damrj76,SRW90,"A 2013 report found Obama's Department of Justice spent $80 million per year cracking down on medical marijuana dispensaries in medical states.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lawmakers-call-for-investigation-into-dojs-continued-crackdown-of-medical-marijuana_us_55bba4f4e4b0d4f33a0296abTwo Congressmen, in response, slipped a provision into the 2014 federal spending bill that explicitly prohibits the DoJ from impeding the states' ability to carry out MMJ laws.In 2015 Obama's DoJ continued prosecuting cases against dispensaries operating legally in medical states, in violation of the new provision. Their reasoning?> the marijuana protections only stop the department from “impeding the ability of states to carry out their medical marijuana laws,” and that the DOJ didn't “expect that the amendment will impact our ability to prosecute private individuals or private entities who are violating the Controlled Substances Act.”The president has knowingly and actively continued cracking down on medical collectives, with taxpayer money, against the law enacted by Congress. Until he addresses that, I don't want to hear anymore of his lip service bullshit about what ""should"" happen."

damrtlj,BasedBoyScout,"Big tobacco wins again.How to keep Marijuana illegal in an increasing national scenario where everyone wonders why its still illegal?Foster an environment where everyone that wants it to be legal, also happens to be largely democratic or libertarian.Force forward the most unpopular candidate in the history of any political party and attempt to force said candidate down a nation's throats by forcing the largely democratic and libertarian Americans that want pot legalized to take up the sword and viciously attack everyone that has any differing political or social views.Once in action, the rejection psychology that is native to most human beings when they feel attacked will elect the opposite candidate and create a vast distaste for the fighting left that wants marijuana to be legal.When marijuana laws go on ballot, many right leaning voters and moderates and independents will vote against legalization to spite the left leaning legalization proponents.And thus alcohol and tobacco stay on top and marijuana stays illegal and all you had to do was fuck up an entire country to get it done.People thought this election cycle was about Trump and Hillary, it was really about keeping cigarettes in the drug store and harmless drugs in the back alley....and none of you ever figured it out.Good job."

damsuv4,Ulahman,Cool story bro....should have done something about that dontcha think?
damsuwh,DotComOnMyBongos,[Chocolate Milk - Action Speaks Louder Than Words](https://youtu.be/SgoZUHO4uMc)
damsv0t,TheFlashFrame,If only he had said this eight years ago.
damswdj,BamaDillert,"Better do it now before Trump bans it again for some bullshit. Smaller government hands - except for the average American citizen. For billionaire CEOs he'll take those pesky, environmentally conscious, worker's health conscious, regulations so we can really make the wealth divide great again."
damsx27,Kidd_Funkadelic,">In the Rolling Stone interview, Obama hinted that he may be more vocal on the issue once he leaves office. “I will have the opportunity as a private citizen to describe where I think we need to go” on marijuana, he said.For shit sake just start being vocal now. It's not like it makes a damn bit of difference for your career path."
damsx2k,VanEazy,He says this but does nothing to make it happen.
damsx35,des1gnate,"I just hope they would make something to combat the smell. I'm all for whoever wants to smoke can smoke, but the smell of the smoke is so strong that it's crazy annoying. The only time cigarette smoke is annoying is when the person is right in front of you and the smoke is blowing in your face. But for marijuana, the guy can be inside his apartment with his window open and I could smell it from across the street. Pls fix."
damsxwg,GenkiElite,Couldn't have said that 8 years ago? Thanks Obama.
damt1gb,KintsugiExp,"I'm kind of tired of world leaders saying this exact thing RIGHT WHEN THEY ARE ABOUT TO LEAVE OFFICE, or shortly after. (Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, Vicente Fox in Mexico, Tony Abbot in Australia, Angela Merkel in Germany, etc.)Really? That's your opinion on marijuana? If only you could have been in a position to actually make a change in public policy and stop the stupid war on drugs.... Oh wait.... Fuck this shit. Stop talking and do something about it."
damt20j,,Hasn't he said this before...a long time ago?
damtei0,outer_fucking_space,"I seem to recall that he was pro decriminalization when he was running in 2008, then when he became president he did nothing to deschedule it, and allowed (or at least didn't stop) a few raids to take place all while saying he thinks states should decide. Then he never said a word about decriminalization or anything.and NOW he fucking says something. I've given him the benefit of the doubt way too many times over the last 8 years."
damzhqc,,I meant in that Bill maher interview. he said the exact alchohol/cigarettes thing.

damtdoq,netposer,"Wow, with only days left he says this. So lame."
damte1w,492394,it's taken 100 years to legalize a drug that's safer than existing legal drugs. mind blowing
damte5p,Vodkacannon,"The republicans have the majority and they wont vote on this, sadly. Govts. and prisons make too much money cracking down on Marijuana offences aswell"
damteic,cnips20,"As the head of the executive branch, why doesn't he direct all law enforcement personnel to not detain or arrest those possessing marijuana? Isn't that how checks and balances work?"
damtf27,killerrayne,"Obama January 19th, 2017 - ""Weed is legal in the US. I'm out!"" Drops mic...."
damti4l,xNoooooch,"I honestly can't believe how much MONEY the United States is missing out on taxing marijuana. Unbelievable. Marijuana prohibition needs to come to an end, and should be rescheduled at the federal level."
damti5v,TRKillShot,"I wish he said this pre lame duck period, come on..."
damtjgo,Mooksayshigh,It would be awesome if legalizing weed was one of the last things Obama did as president. It would be his greatest legacy and the biggest accomplishment of his presidency. Too bad he's 8 years late.
damtkw7,MAGABMORE,*In the last weeks of his presidency*
damtlaj,douche_or_turd_2016,"Except that neither Cigarettes nor (imbibing) alcohol have any medical use. And for recreational purposes cannabis is far safer than alcohol, which is the single most harmful drug in terms of impact on society as a whole (physical, social, financial, etc), beating hard drugs like meth and heroin. And it is also safer than smoking cigarettes.The DEA and US drug policies are soo ass backwards it's ridiculous."
damtn6n,meatduck12,"Remember when this man appointed Michele Leonhart, she of the Bush Administration, as head of the DEA? I remember. All this stuff he says about not having the power to reschedule marijuana is BS, he could have gotten it done a long, long time ago."

damtnwq,supnigz,"Yeah, dude. Blunts, dude."
damto5l,Crazytalkbob,"If he doesn't do anything about it, just saying this ensures it will not happen in the next four years. He needs to start saying the opposite of what he wants so the GOP will pass it."
damtov6,CRISPR,"Meaning, completely prohibited. Maa'shaaa'Allah"
damtowe,Shesaiditsbeautiful,On exit legalize it then and quit talking bout it.
damtox9,I_Stink,"A little late the Obama you puss. If you had guts you would have said this in your first term, or at least in the beginning of your second term."
damtp4m,Astarklife,Not trying to cause any civil unrest but this quote was made by a man that's been president for over 7 years.
damtpc9,Archimid,"Ideally, both cannabis and alcohol should be regulated like cigarettes. They should all be heavily taxed and no propaganda should be allowed for any vice. Propaganda that tells you that alcohol/tobacco/cannabis is cool is what makes people try things that they would be better off never trying. There are inherent dangers for anything that releases dopamine with no effort, but that is absolutely no reason for the government to intrude in people's lives. However people that do use, should pay society for loss of productivity due to alcohol/tobacco/cannabis use."
damtq0a,sheplax10,"Honestly, I think the law should be the same or similar for most drugs."
damtqo1,ras344,So what is he actually going to do about it?
damtr33,,"Wow, last couple of months. Bold. Thanks for the spare change."
damtrw0,Magicgenius,I love you. The earth is a the lord
damts3i,Kazzap,If only he could have done something about that over the last 8 years.
damts79,GrandmaTarkin,"I'm crossing my fingers for one last ""Thanks, Obama""."
damtsm6,Eterna1Oblivion,Ya a little too late. Any other shocking revelations ??
damtt0g,Anarchy738,"Fuck him. He had 8 years to make this proclamation, and he waited until there were no political repercussions for making it. Coward."
damtyb2,Vodkacannon,Wow. You're an ass. He's the first president to say this
damtt1b,,I mean I think we all agree on this I'm not sides. Hell my staunch republican father even does.
damttcb,maltman1856,Would be better if Obama actually did something about it rather than make a statement.
damttl6,nBob20,Maybe Obama shouldn't have waited until the end to have an opinion.
damtuns,chamaelleon,"Obama says obvious, populist things to cover up the lies he's usually telling. Executive Order 13603"

damtxg3,Hillside_Strangler,"We bold on the way out the door now, Brobama.Where were you when we were hoping for change back in 2008?"
damtynh,MyOversoul,"Agreed, so who is in control of that fact since he didnt do anything about it in 8 years? Clearly its not in the presidents control."
damtznq,-Acedia-,"He had 8 years. 8 years! He could of changed the fed, omg I cannot believe this guy."
damu0yp,jmfp,I can agree with this
damu23z,justkjfrost,That said Mr Obama is right on that...
damu4k0,buddboy,well he had eight fucking years instead he increased no knock raids on private dispensaries and homes
damu5ff,hassan214,"This Obama guy is pretty smart, we should elect him as president."
damu5i7,JediAmerican,This guy tokes
damu5nl,digiphaze,"Libertarian Conservative here.. So whats the hold up? The DEA is directly under the executive branch. Removing Marijuana from the drug schedule is simply him directing them to do so. That means its now legal unless the states have passed their own laws against it. So do it.And while you are removing that.. eviscerate the scheduled list and remove shit that should never have been on there.. Testosterone comes to mind. MDMA, Shrooms and more. MJ being schedule 1 is just beyond absurd."
damxa4i,,"He's have to work with the attorney general, the rest of the DEA and the health and human services to go through a long and cumbersome process of moving the drug to a lower schedule or removing it completely. It's been done before, the synthetic drug Marinol is a similar chemical and it's a schedule 3. But that's the thing, is probably politics getting in the way and considering the political stage right now, I'm sure that wasn't a task he was truly interested in taking on. Oh and don't forget, there's a UN treaty the US took part of that basically said thc was to be controlled as such, and were already in violation of that treaty so that's another load of paperwork I'm sure he didn't want to devote time and energy to either"
damu678,Durej,Then do something before you leave! Thanks Obama!!!!
damu6du,,"The dude had fucking 8 years to do something, yet, he didn't. Now that he's about to leave office, he makes an announcement about it. What a joke."

damub0i,ubergeek404,"Well, that's the way he's been personally treating it for years."
damucmz,djresonance,Obama should re schedule pot on the way out.
damudeo,OrgasmicPoonSlayer,If he feels this way maybe he should have done something about it.
damudgs,Kinglink,"He's on the way out the door. Beware, he's going to be making a lot of these statements. Don't believe it, he's had 8 years in office filled with his actions, making claims like this at the end of his presidency is all about ""legacy"" and has nothing to do with his actual policy."
damueo6,wingatewhite,This is a really bad argument for freedom. There isn't a logical reason to tax it in excess of a regular sales tax and there isn't a reason to heavily regulate it beyond being for adults only.
damuewo,Zevyn,Obama says.
damuflt,VersaceCode,Right at the end of his 8 year term...
damugnu,ryan2point0,Well it's great that he did something about those beliefs while he was in office. I doubt Trump would fight the UN for it so I'm really really happy Obama did something while he could.......oh wait....

If only he was in some position of power for the last 8 years in which he could've gotten this done or at least attempted to sway the lawmakers in one way or another.Meanwhile Trump is coming through on campaign promises before he even takes office.RIP Obama ""legacy"""
damuxul,CountryFriedBacon,"I'm a Trump guy but I voted for Obama too. This is one of the issues I thought he would have done something about. A lot of states have done things, but nothing at the Federal level. Obama is all talk as usual."

Medical was voted in via initiative petition in 2012. Today only a handful of dispensaries are open. It took a republican governor to sign legalization to force the few that are open.Now, we are being told rec will be delayed and towns are fighting it all together (like they have with medical). A dem & liberal stronghold is not respecting what people have voted for. Obama was in a position to enact change. He did not. Looking forward, Trump has stated that it should be up to the states. I feel the same way. I wish my liberal and left leaning state would take what people vote for seriously."

damv5vb,LOTRcrr,"Can someone from Colorado or another state that legalized marijuana explain to me what the "".08"" of weed is? Similar to how law officials enforce drinking and driving, how is weed handled? Don't smoke and drive? Very curious about this."
damvoxd,VanDerVaart,I don't think there is an effective way to gauge this at the present. All you can see is if someone has smoked in the last 72 hours (mouth swab) which can't determine if they are presently inhibited. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.
damvyog,LOTRcrr,"I mean I'm fine with weed being legal. My concern are morons who are high and try to drive. Same principle as drinking and driving. How will this be Enforced? To me anyways, it impairs your judgement. In this case, driving safely."
damw26b,VanDerVaart,"I agree. This would be the only legitimate argument against legalization in my opinion and we need some people figuring this out ASAP. I do think there have been studies that show that marijuana does not have a large impact on driving abilities (unlike drinking where it immediately becomes clear) and people drive under the influence of Xanax and other prescribed substances without any public discussion on it, but yeah, we need to figure this out."
damv8fv,LiterallyHiliter,Make it so Mr.President. What do you have to lose?
damvbg2,tony5775,"LATE... Obama and the democratic party's lack of bold action on legalization is one more reason they got crushed in the 2010, 2014 and 2016 elections.Baby steps, incrementalism = boring and weak. but the democrats continue to embrace this as ""good strategy""."

I'll try to explain a bit more clearly.Smoking a cigarette doesn't change the way your body/vision work.Drinking alcohol changes the way your body/vision work.Smoking marijuana changes the way your body/vision work.What does that mean? It means you can't do things like smoke marijuana and drive a car. Just like you can't drink and drive.You can however, smoke cigarettes while driving, because they do not get you high/drunk.As far as cancer goes. Cigarettes increase your chance to get cancer. Just like most things these days. If you were to ban everything that causes cancer, you would be surprised to find that there would be almost nothing left for us to enjoy"

Plain and simple, it isn't anything like those two so it shouldn't be treated anything like them.

danazqf,_Someone_Who_Is_Me_,"Gotta say, I thought I was in r/trees reading all of these posts in favor of legalization. Even with Reddit having a majority of liberal commenters it still warms my weedy heart to see so many people wanting this to happen. We need to get our fellow humans out of prison for doing things that cause no one harm, and we need to be able to study the medicinal benefits of not just cannabis but of all psychoactive substances (looking at you, psilocybin). There are observable negative effects to any substance at high enough doses but with proper research and understanding comes informed dosage control, which is really what people need for these substances. I doubt Obama will make this change, this is far from the only time he's mentioned weed in his presidency. I lost a lot of faith in him when he addressed the sandy hook shooting by saying the US's shooting fatalities were the worst of any nation for that year when in reality after seeing the statistics myself they were substantially lower than multiple countries including Norway and Germany. If he does this, I believe he'll save a lot of innocent lives especially of the minority citizens he claims to care about so much. Taking weed away from the arrestible offences will in some way make it harder to target minorities for minor things that white people do just as often if not more. Trump cares about public image, he won't take weed away if he's thrust into a nation whose economy and job market just got a huge figurative stimulus package from the cannabis industry. People need jobs and people will pay out their ass for weed. If Obama won't do it for the legacy he should do it for the economy"

damym6t,joelberg,Marijuana levels are hard to determine person to person. People in this study could have smoked days before and still been found positive when the testing happened. That is unless they were testing in some method that I haven't heard of.
dan2ddy,swaggy_butthole,"No, I read it and I figured it out. Marijuana does slightly increase driving danger but not double. What has most likely happened is that more people are using weed thus more people are wrecking under the influence.For example, let's say there is a .5% chance of wrecking and 100,000 drive high in a year, that's 500 incidents. Now let's say, after legalization, 200,000 people drive high in a year with the same wreck rate, that is 1,000 people. Statistics can be bullshit if you don't account for confounding variables. Not to mention, the man who wrote the article said **he was opposed to legalization**. Do not accept anything he says as fact without cross-checking."

damg87h,ZeiglerJaguar,"Is anyone reading the article before slapping out a *then do something about it you twit*?>In the Rolling Stone interview published this week, Obama also reiterated his long-standing position that changing federal marijuana laws is not something the president can do unilaterally. “Typically how these classifications are changed are not done by presidential edict,” he said, “but are done either legislatively or through the DEA. As you might imagine, the DEA, whose job it is historically to enforce drug laws, is not always going to be on the cutting edge about these issues.”"

I'm going to do quite nicely.It's everyone else not quite so fortunate that's going to suffer. Whether it's the dismantling of Medicare, destroying the protections the ACA provides for millions of people, the rights of my LGBT friends and families, the climate that impacts our future generations, the future economic destruction he's about to impart on us with his demonstrably dangerous economic plans, people who send their kids to public schools, or so many other things. Lots of suffering will be theirs to enjoy. But I'm well positioned, so it's fine for me.The irony is how negatively his policies will impact so many of the voters who thought he was their savior. And we see how quickly he fell in line with the standard GOP wet-dream of Ayn Randish, union busting, deregulation nonsense. So antithetical to the well being of his working class supporters."

Does anyone here seriously believe Obama would have done this if Clinton had won the election? He's basically trying to shove Trump in front of a bus by forcing him to take a stand on a no-win issue before he's even entered office. Half his supporters feel one way, half the other; Obama is simply trying to fracture his base.So disappointing to see such an important issue, one that has hundreds of thousands of otherwise law abiding citizens locked into jail for what they do in their spare time, reduced to a strategic asset. One final fuck-you before leaving office.It's petty, it's small and it's entirely politics as usual."

damp1mz,wrek,Alcohol should be treated as poison.
dampeog,xgbone79,"I really don't understand the obession with legalizing weed. Medicinal purposes I don't have a problem with, but for pleasure I don't understand. In later high school years and college I partied my ass off drinking, smoking, acid, shrooms, cocaine and then I grew up. I risk jail time just to get high. Sure if it was legal I could have smoked and snorted my life away with no worry of legal consequences, but I'm glad it wasn't and isn't because thats exactly what I probably would have done. I have many friends and family who wrecked their lives using drugs. All started the same way, cigarettes + alcohol + weed + crack/meth/heroin. It's all garbage legal or not. We have far more important things in life to focus on than legalizing weed, just so people can smoke a bowl every night because it's not harmful like alcohol. If it alters normal thought process it's garbage."
dampx6f,lord_stryker,It should be legalized because we have millions of people in jail for no other reason than using it costing taxpayers billions every year. Untold lives are ruined with a drug record and can't get a job. Those in jail are removed from society and suffer great harm mentally and physically. Economically they are unable to provide wealth and labor to the economy.That's why it should be legalized.
dams2zb,xgbone79,"They knew the law at the time, just like I did. I made the choice and got lucky. How many of those locked up just had some bad luck or sit in jail each day thinking, gosh I wish I could get out and contribute to society. What ruined their lives? The legal consequences of their actions or their actions. They chose to break the law, you or they may not agree but that was and still is the law. The law did not ruin their lives, they did by their choices. Sounds like anti gun talk, guns kill people, nope the person holding the gun kills people. The law ruined their life, nope the person breaking the law did. I wish we didn't have to pay for others bad choices also, but life can be tough."
dan8k5w,Shaojack,Why is against the fucking law to begin with?
dampid2,Harambe513,"I couldn't care less about pot being legalized. I see the pros from an economic standpoint and I get the argument that it should be treated just like alcohol or tobacco. The issue I have is that from my experience with people using it those people are literally bums. I have a handful of friends that smoke pretty regularly and they all still live at home with their parents at the age of 27/28. They have no ambitions to do anything other than their minimum wage jobs. Any money they do save goes straight to their dealer and that's it. On the other hand I have dozens of other friends who don't smoke but they drink socially and some smoke cigs and they all have successful jobs, families, and futures. I'm not saying that there aren't successful, driven people who smoke pot out there, but this just seems like it's too common of an occurrence to just mark it off as not harmful or addicting to someone's lifestyle. I'm just saying...I know way more people who smoke daily than I do who drink daily. So for anyone saying weed isn't addictive, you're wrong. Maybe not physically addictive , but it is mentally."
damq0kx,Xeiliex,"So you care? I mean this wall of text sure looks like it. I happen to know successful stoners, are you sure it's not a lack of opportunity?"
danlf9k,Harambe513,"Of the 6 people I know that do it daily 3 went to college and dropped out after 2-3 years. One of those 3 people actually had nearly a full ride to a Big10 school. The others never really got driven after high school but they never really tried either. So I'd say for the most part the ones I know did have the opportunities but they just weren't motivated enough to follow through with them. Maybe that's because of the weed, maybe not. There does still seem to be a correlation between the two though, at least in my opinion."
damplt6,LetsBUILDaWALL,"Just what we need, more unproductive youth, all doped up!"
dan8l1l,Shaojack,"Its not like they really stopped it. Its cause way more problems than its solved, its a failed policy."

However, if that's your thing and you want to grow a plant at your home? Well then have at it...people shouldn't be locked up for years. I side with libertarian views on that."

damqyjt,Z0di,"Hey buddy, legalize it. You have the power."
damr110,biffbuttcus,Well great. Maybe he could have included it in Obamacare so I could at least get as high as my premiums.
damsl2n,Bongoalot,"I'm surprised to see so many people hating on Obama for this. Partly because reddit has shown it's liberal bias.There are multiple reasons I can think of why Obama didn't act on this early in office. He is the first black president of the US, it would probably feed racist stereotypes if he had acted or was as vocal about this early in office.I personally don't believe the president role is what the majority of the public thinks it is. Of course this is only my belief, of course I don't actually know but it's what I've personally deduced from observing our political system. So read on with taking what I've typed with a grain of salt.I do believe the president role is mostly a puppet. When the presidential candidate wins and is debriefed, etc. they are probably handed an incredibly overwhelming amount of information that is not known to the public, and it takes a long time before they adjust. Think about when you get a new job and the time it can take to adjust to something very different than anything you've ever done before. Imagine all the classified information you might be given, and it might take a long list of classified history to read through to understand why things are the way they are now.Meanwhile the president role has obligations to fulfill in existing operations/initiatives made long before the president has been put into office and probably has limited if any authority to subvert those operations/initiatives. Also, the president has obligations to fulfill the wishes of it's contributors, supporters, and anyone else in bed with the electoral college, or any of the people you see (and a large portion you never see) in the media who endorsed that presidential candidate.When you or anyone else praises a politician (which always furrows my brow when i hear or read), they probably don't realize that there is an entire organization of people behind each politician who's purpose is to ensure that the politician gets summarized information regarding every topic that the politician may be faced with in their line of work. The president probably has to cover more than most politicians, so they are probably getting handed an immense amount of information coming from all across the globe every day. Can one person actually do all that? Probably not. So a lot of what a president is doing, saying and acting on has probably been thoroughly analyzed and filtered through multiple people's hands before it ever reaches to the actual act of that politician talking about the subject. So when you hear speeches from president Obama, please keep in mind you are likely hearing not Obama's words, but a collaborative adulterated version of what Obama or his organization has come up with. And of course he is the one actually speaking, so he has the final say.Believing that...it is very easy for me to see why Obama waited until now to speak out on this, he probably has diminished responsibility, his obligations have been uplifted, and those people who have been collaborating with him to make sure he serves America correctly have found new jobs or are preparing to work for Trump.I may be wrong on all of this, but at least i'm thinking for myself."
damslj3,MyDiggity,"Yea, another addicted substance for the only purpose to create tax revenue."
damsus9,PurpleZerg,Yea lets just stick to the actually harmful stuff that is currently legal.
damuh8q,TotallynotnotJeff,"Well he missed his fucking chance now, didn't he"
damuhlu,whereto_,"That's great I love weed and all, but he needs to be talking about more than this. He needs to be talking about DAPL, Snowden, Chelsea, and so many other things he had 8 fucking years to talk about and didn't. Including marijuana cigarettes. Fuck him."
damui0e,davidrhill1986,Well Obama is right. They would save a lot of time and money if it was just legalised with the same regulations as alcohol. Cannabis would bring so much to a country's economy. I wish they would just legalise it here in the UK. It's enforced with such a soft approach as it is. It's definately no worse than alcohol.
damui8r,luxuryballs,"Meaning I can't buy it from my friends privately? Only the state is allowed? No thanks, just decriminalize it please."

damulh4,OBAN141,All talk no action.
damuodt,Magicgenius,"Bob Marley says. 'All laws are illegal. The only law which is law is the law of life. The law of live. It is laws that cause crime and violence """
damuoep,YouMustReallyHateYou,"The DEA is an executive-branch agency. Richard Nixon created it with the sole purpose being to jail his hippy anti-war opponents and have an excuse to create a new class of felons disqualified from voting.Obama could have, at any time after his swearing-in ceremony, simply removed marijuana from the DEA's registry with a mere stroke of his pen. I'm not sure what the faux helpless act is about unless he's fishing for support 'cause he's scared of a backlash. But he's a coward who never kept his progressive promises and governs like a moderate Republican, so who knows."
damuoi4,thevikingwolfe,"Yeah, but he did fuck all to decriminalize it ."
damuokn,Threash78,Obama has had eight years to treat marijuana like cigarettes or alcohol and hasn't done a damned thing about it.
damuorl,Shpongledd,Oh yeah? Well do something about it... you've had 8 years... it's still schedule 1 and you raided dispensaries in your first term - violating state laws
damuqu2,,Yea he's just trying to destroy the country on his way out to spite us all for voting trump.
damvgoy,eatadick92,He had 8 years to fix it. What progress did he make to legalize it?

damvo5a,nomad005,Cannabis is nothing like cigarettes or alcohol.

damw19w,2run2,"Then correct that shit - pussy!! Quit giving lip service. If you mean it, do something about it. At this point, I think you are just pandering."
damw1xk,MalkaraNL,"I somehow doubt that America would have reached the state of semi-acceptance it would have reached now, without Obama slowly leading a race towards this state-of-mind. I think he has been working towards goals such as these, without openly using his presidential powers and allowing the opposition to gain points by publicly going against him."
damw9hw,lmshertz,Well you had 8 years to speak up about it Barry. Too damn late now
damwfgj,apply_in_person,He had eight years to at least attempt to affect some sort of change in this area; instead he did jack shit and there are tens of thousands (more?) of non violent drug offenders still incarerated.
damwg86,longrifle,"lol he's had 8 years to say this and to push for it on the federal level. But on his way out the door he's like ""Oh yeah, by the way I'm still cool!"" Give me a break."
damwrf4,Paddlesons,"To those critical of Obama in not doing more during his term. Do you really believe he didn't want to decriminalize marijuana? Can you IMAGINE the fallout and political capital that not only him but the entire left would suffer? Just think about him being the first black preisdent and doing that. Hell, if anything it would bring it to the forefront and energize the right to keep it illegal if you gave them that ammunition. You can't just keep thinking about things you want when you want them you have to be smart about it or else your opponent, especially the Republicans, will use it to decimate you."
damwx3y,,Actually if anything he could've used that before the election to galvanize voters to come out. Particularly millennials. I remember hearing a lot of liberals bashing Hillary when there was talk about her not being for legalization.
damx249,Paddlesons,"Yeah, he could've but most of the data was pointing towards Hillary winning and maybe decidedly. It was wrong of course, but I can see why he wouldn't want to rock the boat with something like that."
damxemm,,Honestly that's one thing that I feel democrats can never do. They're so bad at turning out voters (aside Obama) that they play safe at every election and lose an opportunity to actually energize their base. I won't go into how bad the polls were but I'm sure there were some clues the Hillary campaign was picking up on because it didn't really push for the progressive platform points that I think would've been beneficial.
damxk89,Paddlesons,"You could try that and I hope they do but it's absurd to think how you know that will pan out. I mean just a month or so ago we were ready to call an end to the Republican party and we see how that turned out. Who knows what would happen if Democrats just said ""fuck it"" full board progressive"
damxos9,,"I don't mean ""full on progressive"" per se but god if only they grew a pair. I honestly would love it if they pulled that ""wrong"" shit whenever someone blatantly pushed a lie or an exaggeration as fact. You know, fight fire with fire. Like Hillary supporters have taught us, democrats have to fall in line anyway so why not push back a little. /s"
damx0e5,Prerogativ,"Makes no sense. Most americans back legalization and its legal, in some form, in 25-26 states. There is no backlash. This isnt 1975.Theres a caucus of libertarian leaning senators and house members who back this shit being decriminalized.Don't defend Obama, just cause. He's just playing politics, he had every opportunity, including some months back when the DEA was contemplating it, to reschedule it. On top of that, he's gone after growers in states that are LEGAL during the last 4-8 years. He just doesn't want to be seen as the bad guy so he started pardoning drug offenders as some consolation. Stop seeing things in such a partisan divide and youll realize Obama plays the same game you accuse the other party of doing. The exact. Same. Game."
damx8x5,Paddlesons,"It doesn't matter what most Americans think in the context of some poll it matters how it looks when it's on Fox News and conservative talk radio. I'm not defending him ""just cause"" I'm telling you the reality of what would happen. I think you're attacking him, ""just cause"" without realizing the consequences of the action."
damxkzc,Richandler,"Obama, your legacy is about to wiped out. Maybe, it's time for dramatic action in your last days."
damy0ks,InvestigatingXBoston,"Obama says a lot of things. At this point he is only trying to leave office with some sort of ""legacy"" which we all know he is going to be marked down to be the least accomplished president in American history. At least we can say he gave us gay marriage, expensive healthcare and maybe marijuana? Nothing could fix what Obama did to the black community."
damz0yg,RedBeard94,"The President tends to have little effect on the economy, or a lot less than the average person expects. Also, he has a record number of months with positive job reports. He has done quite a bit despite one of the unfriendliest congresses to ever exist. I think there have been a few other Presidents who have had even less productive presidencies too. And besides not paying enough attention to minorities, which all 43 Presidents before him (except maybe Lincoln getting rid of slavery) have been guilty of too, what has he done to the black community that other Presidents haven't?"
dan08zn,InvestigatingXBoston,"Well for one Obama has told the black community on numerous occasions that they are victims of systemic oppression. Such as when he said that ""It could have been me"" on Treyvon Martin. Injecting himself into an ongoing criminal investigation and implying that the alleged perp was guilty without all of the evidence. When he implies that police are killing black men at a rate that does not match up with the Federal crime statistics. He tells the black community that they are victims while police officers are being targeted in a record number of ambush style assaults with weapons resulting in the needless loss of life. Telling people they are victims of systematic racism while they are a child is extremely damaging to ones psyche and through the persistence of the constant barrage of demeaning and damning accusation of systematic hatred towards a minority will eventually cause a disruption in the coexisting communities. The Obama administration has been more destructive to the black community in America than any other president in the last 100 years."
dan1i4o,RedBeard94,"I have to disagree with you about this. He has been pointing out that, in general, black people have been getting the short end of the stick. They tend to be poor, and poor people are at quite a big disadvantage in life. In addition, we are having conversations about these things. Sure, there could have been a way to start a conversation about police brutality without invoking attacks on police, but there is a conversation going on. While talking about these trends, he is talking about issues that are already at the forefront of the American attention. There were already a lot of protests before he made mention of Trayvon Martin and that he could have been Trayvon Martin. There were already a lot of minorities who were feeling like everything was against them. Whether you think this is accurate or not (and I believe that it is mostly accurate), I think it is unfair to say it is because of Obama that people are thinking this way."
dan2yht,InvestigatingXBoston,"Yes. I am only pointing out that Obama promoted racial tension through instances where he victimized the black man and painted the police and the system in general as the bad guy. That lie really damages young and impressionable minds and really alters the social landscape. A man of such influence should be aware that if he injects himself into a situation and casts blame without facts, especially over something that can cause sever racial tension that he needs to know what he is saying is the right thing to say. Racial tensions have not been this bad my whole life and im getting up there."
dan3fli,RedBeard94,"I think that Obama was making statements in reaction to what he was seeing with protests and the like, and I don't think he did it in a dangerous way.Also, I don't know if you are old enough to have lived through the civil rights movement, but I refuse to believe racial tensions now are even close to what they were then.Also, I think the rise in racial tension can be seen to have 2 causes. 1) There actually being a lot more racial issues and problems that have popped up, or 2) people who are not wanting these issues to go away are more emboldened to fight against them changing. I think it is the second. I think the country is really starting to see what they issues are when it comes to race, and people who don't want these issues to go away are causing problems."
dan4shs,InvestigatingXBoston,"The problem is that the whole Black Lives Matter movement in specific was founded on the lie that they are victims of systematic abuse and murder by the police. In fact! FBI crime stats prove that police in proportion to amount of violent crime, exorcise more caution and restraint in regards to violent force when apprehending and arresting a black man. The foundation of BLM was built on a lie perpetuated by the media, social media the major new cables and THE PRESIDENT!!!"
dan59t4,RedBeard94,"Police use more proportion when arresting and apprehending black men compared to whom? Do they use more restraint than vigilantes like George Zimmerman? Do they use more restraint than when arresting white people? Also, what does ""in proportion to violent crime"" mean? Does that mean that since there is a tendency for black people to commit crime at a higher rate it is more acceptable for police to use violence against them than it is for violence to be used against white people they are arresting? I mean, I think there is something that needs to be discussed when looking at how police handle arrests. Why is it that there are a bunch of unarmed black teenagers who are killed by police, yet white men who go on killing sprees either end up getting arrested and not shot? Why did those unarmed teens die while Dylann Roof, who shot up a church, was not only arrested, but was provided a bullet-proof vest when arrested? There is still quite a bit of racism in this country, and I would rather it be overstated than understated at this point."
dan5rpy,InvestigatingXBoston,"You can take a look at the numbers yourself they are fairly black and white. The numbers prove that police exorcise more restraint when apprehending black folk than when dealing with white folk. to give you a visual, 10 black people and 10 white people all commit the same crime of attacking a police officer. More white criminals would have lost their lives or had been violently apprehended than their black counterparts due to politics. I am not saying that is a good thing. but it proves that the whole idea that black people are being targeted by the police in a manner that is out of proportion to the crime rates is a lie. It was all built on a repeated lie."
dan66ub,RedBeard94,"I think that is misleading. I don't doubt that if you had 10 Dylann Roofs and 10 black equivalents, that more Dylann Roofs would die than black equivalents would. The point is that there have been a number of black teens who have been killed when they have been guilty of (at the very worst) no more than minor shop lifting. Eric Garner was selling cigarettes illegal, yet died at the hands of police. Michael Brown's death sparked the Ferguson protests. He was unarmed when he was shot, and there was speculation that he might have shoplifted earlier in the day. An unarmed shoplifter should not be met with bullets, especially not a few hours after the fact. Black people are stopped by police more, whether or not they are committing a crime when they are stopped. That is when these big incidents happen. There are not many people complaining about the treatment of people in the midst of crimes, especially when they are armed, they are angry about the treatment of unarmed black men who are not in the process of committing any crime."
dan87b1,InvestigatingXBoston,"You seem to forget that in most of the cases they were resisting arrest. we can go through each case you mention and prove with facts that they were justified. But the facts dont seem to change anything for you do they? There seem to be two worlds. One is the real world and the other is a made up world. Everyone has both its just that some people cant handle the real world so they make up more lies to reinforce their faulted ideology built on lies being spread on leftist social media and most 'news' organizations. Unfortunately, even when confronted with sound, reasonable intellectual nuggets of truth one looks away in fear of ever being called wrong. You people are sick but you arent a lost cause, just a bit confused."
dao7f3t,RedBeard94,"I am going to ignore the awful ad hominem attacks and just say that even if they were resisting arrest by (in almost all cases) RUNNING AWAY from the police, using any sort of lethal force is unacceptable. Sure, it might be resisting arrest (even though most of the incidents didn't involve a crime in progress nor a warrant), but non-violent resistance should NEVER be met with bullets. When we criticize other governments for cracking down on protests, one of the big issues cited is non-violent resistance being met with lethal force. I don't care if the police give chase when someone runs away, but regardless of who the person resisting is, you NEVER shoot at them if they are running away and not threatening anyone's life. Most of these unarmed teens were shot in the back. That is bigger than any other context. They were unarmed and running away. If you don't see an issue with that, then we will never have enough common ground to have any sort of common ground for discussion about this."
dao9bi2,InvestigatingXBoston,"That is not true at all. Most of these high profile police shootings have been proven to be justified. Most have been physically resisting arrest and / or endangering or presenting an immediate danger to the responding officer and civilians in the vicinity. What you just said was a lie that you are either borrowing from someone else or that you made up yourself to corroborate your delusional idea that the police are systematically killing unarmed black folks. Again, the FBI crime statistics prove to us that that is not reality, the nation wide crime stats prove that police officers exorcise more restraint when dealing with black folks than when dealing with white folks. The numbers do not lie. I am sure you have taken yourself over to the FBI website to see for yourself as you seem to be someone who cares about this 'issue' If you would like to point out any one of the high profile cases where an 'unarmed' ""innocent"" black man was killed by the police i would be happy to discuss the details with you but again, at this point you seem to be glazing over the facts to remain in your comfortable, blissful ignorance. (not to sound rude) But how else are you going to learn if you yourself have not actually studied the numbers that our tax dollars are spent on collecting. Millions of dollars go into compiling this information only for people like you to disregard them (the facts) as a nuisance to your faulted ideology. The cognitive dissonance is strong with this one.Even, ""Hands Up Dont Shoot"" was a false narrative from the very beginning and we see millions of people in the streets 'protesting' repeating the phrase when Mike Brown never actually had his hands in the air, like he should have had in the first place! Again, i am not trying to come off as a pompous dick head, its just hard to giver you the facts over and ovr again knowing that you ignorantly ignore them in order to not have to look at yourself in the mirror and say ""Hey, maybe i was wrong"" I mean, come on! and i am sure you have no idea who Jamayla Bolden is! you will have to google her name. You people should be talking about what happened to her! not some criminal who put a police officers lifer in harms way."
daockht,RedBeard94,"I did have to look up the name Jamayla Bolden. And I am not surprised I didn't hear about it because it has literally nothing to do with this discussion. Sure, it is tragic, but bringing up black on black crime just deflects from the content of the conversation. Yes, black on black crime needs to be dealt with, but that does not mean that we should not talk about deaths at the hands of police. I also want to turn your attention to this: [A Center of Juvenile and Criminal Justice report on who is most likely to be killed by police.](http://www.cjcj.org/news/8113) It shows that black men ages 15-44 are all at least roughly 2.5 times as likely as the average man (regardless of race) to be killed by police. [This article adds to those stats by citing numbers compiled by the Washington Post that show that unarmed black men are 5 times more likely to be killed by police than unarmed white men.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/07/11/arent-more-white-people-than-black-people-killed-by-police-yes-but-no/)Also, I did take a look at some articles that cite the FBI numbers (though was unable to find the actual raw numbers after a 10 minute or so search), and it does show that there might not be widespread bias against black people by all police, but there is a troubling trend that there are some police who seem to have no problem with shooting black men. And while it might not be a police-specific systematic issue, it is a sign of an issue that is somewhat systematic in nature throughout the United States, and that is there are a not-insignificant number of people who, at least act like black lives matter less than white lives. I am not a fan of vilifying police as a group, but I think we should be vilifying the police who shot Michael Brown, the police who killed Eric Garner, the police who killed Samuel DuBose, the police who killed Brendon Glenn, the police who killed Freddy Gray, and the police who killed Walter Scott, as a start. I am a Black Lives Matter supporter in the sense that I think the way black people are being treated in this country needs to be investigated and discussed, but I also believe that MOST police officers are not biased against black people, and will treat everyone equally based on how they react to the police."
daodhr4,InvestigatingXBoston,"That article is citing information collected by a non-profit whose aim as it says in its personal bio - ""The Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice (CJCJ) is a nonprofit nonpartisan organization whose mission is to reduce society's reliance on incarceration as a solution to social problems."" So, if their ""mission is to reduce society's reliance on incarceration"" then what kind of 'non partisan' analytics do you believe this 'non-profit' could ever give us? how could we rely on these people to develop some sort of rational opinion if their stated goal is to basically abolish prison? It seems a bit biased in my opinion. In fact! Ill give you this link so you can have some real numbers. - https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/tables/table-43 (((( Scroll down to the demographics by race section to get an understanding of ratios https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/00 You will need this information in judging the above FBI numbers correctly))))"
daoem6d,RedBeard94,"Alright. I am not seeing anything surprising in these numbers. Without a whole lot of analysis, it doesn't seem like there are more black people killed based on the numbers of arrests, and by the way, the sources you provided have nothing on the number of people killed by police. I think these stats don't tell the whole story, and that is why you need stats like the ones I provided. I am not sure why an organization wanting to reduce incarceration is going to mean their numbers are wrong in any way. I am sure that if you talked to police or FBI agents that most of them would be happy to be out of a job if it mean less crime and less reliance on incarceration. Additionally, they aren't trying to stem arrests or change what police do, they are trying to change what happens after the arrest and conviction. Unless you have any sort of indication that their numbers are wrong, then I am going to believe them, especially since they are backed up by the Washington Post numbers. The fact remains that young black men are much more likely to be killed by police than the average man, and unarmed black men killed at a much higher rate than unarmed white men are. Finally, I provided a few names of black men who have been killed at the hands of police, if you would like to discuss any of them."
daofo2h,InvestigatingXBoston,"So, let me do the thinking for you. If the violent crime rate is virtually the same leaning onto the side of African Americans. Knowing this along with the fact that black people acount for 13% of the population yet commit equal to or MORE violent crime than white people who have three times that amount of 13% then that means the black population is commiting these crimes 3 times as often as their white counterparts. So, in knowing this simple fact it brings us to where we are today. When you see more more white people getting killed by police annually and yet they commit less violent crime than black folks that tells us that the Police use less lethal force when apprehending black people. edit* Thus, rendering the narrative that black people are being targeted by the police false. It destroys the crazy idea that black people are treated worse than white people by the police. It ruins your doctrine and yet you still practice your cognitive dissonance"
daogri2,RedBeard94,"Yes, but the killings that people are complaining about have not been violent criminals. They have been people who have been killed who are unarmed. So sure, when looking just at violent criminals, that paints the picture you are describing. The BLM complaints aren't about armed black men who are killed, or black violent criminals who are killed. Instead they are about unarmed black men who are killed. The most some of these men did was decide to run. That is not something that should be punished by death. Nor should saying the wrong thing during a traffic stop, nor should not listening if there is no weapon involved."
daog431,InvestigatingXBoston,"Heres one thing that is surprising: Murders: year 2013White 3,799 Black4,379population: ratio White 73% black 13%what do these numbers tell you????? im waiting."
daogyyr,RedBeard94,"They tell me that there is a violence issue in the black community. Does that make it any better than an unarmed man is shot in the back while running away? Does that make a man dying after telling the police he can't breathe any better? Does it change the fact that unarmed black men are being killed at a higher rate than unarmed white men?It also tells me that these stats line up with poverty. More black people live in poverty and poverty stricken areas than white people do, and that is where the crime mostly happens. It likely has more to do with poverty than it does with race."
daohtu4,InvestigatingXBoston,"Ok. Mike Brown was a violent criminal who violently resisted arrest and deserved what he got. That is an opinion based on the facts of the case and his prior arrest record. ""Hands up dont shoot"" is the lie that he had his hands up which he did not."
daohx74,InvestigatingXBoston,"Again, that is not a fact. Unarmed black men are not being killed at a rate that is disproportionately higher to the violent crime statistics among their race. You do not have the proof to back up that claim."
daoj4g4,RedBeard94,"Sure, once the evidence came out, it was clear that Brown wasn't an innocent victim. This evidence was months in the making, and even now is not 100% clear. Back before the grand jury finished up, it was very unclear. What about the other cases that I mentioned?"

damng5v,GrumbleSnatch,I think the idea is that if it was legal and regulated then it would be harder for kids to get because it wouldn't be sold by criminals.
dan3r7a,39nectarines,Anyone who's been a kid in the last twenty years can probably confirm this. Easy as fuck to get a bag of weed when half the kids at your high school sell it. Alcohol? Good luck unless you spend $$ on a legit fake ID and know a cool convenience store.
dan9r4h,Tyr808,"There's that, and there was also a thread a few days ago asking what illegal dealers had done after legalization was enacted in their state. They said they had to lower prices significantly to compete with the ease of access and quality of a dispensary, and most decided the margins were too low (and black market dealing is still illegal anyway). They ended up going back to school, getting jobs, or moving to areas where it's still illegal. It's pretty damn clear that legalization is a win on all fronts."
dammp9t,GamerCole,[Deleted]
damnmbx,InsideItAllFeelsSame,"You're completely right about that. Problem is that booze and cigarettes are now so deeply ingrained in the societal fabric that it is almost too late to turn back, as sad as that sounds.I just think our society as a whole would be better off without fully legalized weed. You want to stop throwing people in jail over small amounts of pot? Fine, that sounds very reasonable. But to legalize it and have Phillip Morris one day selling it behind the counter of our local 7-11s just doesn't seem like smart to me, that's all."

When they hear about marijuana you tell them the facts and maybe your opinion. If you treat them like adults they will act like adults. If you treat them like children they will act like children."

You don't need a federal statute, you need to take ownership your own personal needs and vulnerabilities and not expect the government to solve all your problems, especially when it directly creates even more problems for others."

By highlighting my educational background i was simply demonstrating to you that, yes, i actually COULD make an incredibly strong argument as to why or why not i believe a marginal slice of the Trump electorate to be bigots.....if you'll review the comment i posted, you'll see i never specifically labeled YOU a bigot. Although, the more and more you go on, the phrase 'Me think thou doth protesteth too much' keeping running though my mind...along with the mental image of trying to have a sword fight with a man wielding a spoon..."
damxsdk,Duralon,What? /r/politics has a post on /r/all that isn't on Donald Trump? Progress! I'm proud of you all.

dan20a4,Reebait,President Donald J Trump
dan2bly,AmateurHourPorn,Obama wants to go North Korea to snowboard on January 21 and smoke weed with Kim Jung
dan2d5q,jackface101,About F*****G time
dan88ge,Shaojack,"About fucking too late.Not only did he wait until he was on his way out, he waited until after the election his team lost, there is nothing to be done now, pure political lip service."
dancdce,jackface101,of course it's too late but the fact that an in office president said that is great
dan43xu,threesixzero,"This was his attitude before he got elected YET once he became president, they spent as twice as much raiding dispensaries than Bush's administration.Now it is the end of his presidency and he obviously isn't going to do shit but give lip service to a very popular stance in hopes of us remembering him in a good light. Fuck you, Barack."
danis64,HandMeMyThinkingPipe,"The Cole memo prevented enforcement in legal states long enough for those states industries to get a foothold and without it we wouldn't be having this conversation most likely. So, while he could have done more sooner then he did, he did at least do that and helped pave the way to the end of prohibition. Hopefully the trump drug war all stars do the right thing and at the very least leave things how they are."
dan46ai,dagoth04,"How brave of him to do this on his way out. He had 8 years, this is purely a stunt."
dan88sb,griefercast,obama also said Trump is not qualified to be president and look what happened. perhaps its time for him to stop giving opinions.
dan8c2q,Erger,"The only problem is that right now, we don't have a reliable, timely way to test for marijuana intoxication. We don't have an equivalent of the breathalyzer that would test people suspected of driving high. Until we have that, I would feel very uncomfortable knowing there could be people driving while high and we have no way to test for it."
dan8jo5,seeking101,getting high on weed is nothing like being drunk
dan8v2a,Erger,It still impairs your ability to competently drive a car.
dan94gk,SpleenballPro,Then by that logic we should make alcohol illegal. A breathalyzer has never stopped someone from driving drunk...
dan9xk5,Erger,It's illegal to drive drunk and we can arrest people for that because we can prove it on the side of the road. To test for marijuana you need a urine test or something way more complicated that takes a long time to do. I don't understand why this is such an offensive idea to you.
dancgpo,SpleenballPro,How long does it take to prove someone's DNA at a crime scene. You worry about being able to prove right here and now while people wait in jail for months to be exonerated?
dano747,Erger,Being able to prove someone is drunk or high while you stand at the side of the road means you can take them off the road and keep them from endangering more people. It's not the same thing as DNA at all. And most people don't sit in jail while they wait.
danilc1,HandMeMyThinkingPipe,"Actually impairment is the issue, for even semi regular smokers the presence of THC in the body does not at all indicate impairment and there is evidence that cannabis does not impair driving to anywhere near the extent that alcohol does. It's largely just not as big a problem as it is with alcohol."
dan8jmn,andyb5,The President telling kids to go smoke weed. what a role model
damff5x,yerPalSal,Because cigarettes being legal has worked out so well.
damn7er,HROmega21,"Well we don't have a bloody black market for them, so.. yes?Do you propose that we just ban everything that's distasteful in your eyes? Some type of freedom you adhere to."
damo0h4,yerPalSal,"way to jump to a conclusion. I don't care whether is legal or not. I do hope everyone involved will consider that once it is legalized, it won't be something that can be undone, so make sure the decision is the best one for future generations. But for me, leave it up to the states."
damo6v1,HROmega21,"You made an asinine statement, like legal cigarettes has been some type of disaster. When it comes to a subject that in one state is perfectly legal and in another can land in you in jail for years, I don't think ""leave it to the states"" is applicable."

dangvle,yerPalSal,my point exactly... comparing legal pot to legal cigs is asinine.
dan8bzu,Shaojack,"Yeah because the war on drugs has been such a huge success, just look at the lack of drugs... wait they are still everywhere and they fill our prisons with non-violent ""criminals"""
damgk0c,MarbhDamhsa,"Then deschedule it, jackass. The only people you're fooling by pretending it's out of your hands are the low information voters that just elected an orange Moussolini. It is specifically up to the president to alter the table of the CSA."
damjiqu,sarcastroll,Not enough time left. He can't deschedule with an executive order. It's against the Controlled Substance Act ironically enough. Which applies to the president.
damppn3,thebigticket88,Have you read any of the comments in this thread? The leftists are the ones supporting/defending him and the trump voters are calling him out on this bullshit. So actually the opposite of your comment is true. He's only fooling the same people who got fooled by the media for the past year. What a surprise!

damu9tc,boatrightcl,"Is that another statement... clearly if you do not understand than you are not aware or experienced in overthrowing the state and it's authorities. Substances are used in state craft to influence and radicalize ""open minded"" people. You clearly have a President that is threatening your country through domestic policies that reshape foreign policy agreements. Think of the unwinding it has caused and leaves room for you to gather these words and thoughts as I type them. If ignorance is your game, I suggest you ask better questions than assuming you have some form of allegation toward my text you don't comprehend. Contradicting your statement, ""Can you? Read what you wrote it's not very succinct,"" do you struggle with thoughts that are not your own?Furthermore, as dark money gains in favor because of the black market; you further allow additional substances. But I think you clearly understand this. You will also have further unrest and it will impact human health and services policies. Politics will ensue, rearranging social services impacted. The state will be threaten by federal funds being withheld and those same funds that could aid the states irresponsible behavior will be appropriated to states that follow federal statutes. Since states want to follow themselves, the federal government will increase it's domestic security observing the volatile risk of itself since states will become more belligerent with substance abuse rather than recreation. Economic trade between states and it's variety of resources will be reshaped, suffocating the states that have become oblivious to their federal protection. It's simple statecraft.How about some questions or are you just simple minded?"
damunja,kdog1147,I must be simple minded. I mean I have an accounting degree and went to law school and focused my studies on marijuana law and now work as a marijuana regulator in a city which licenses marijuana businesses but clearly you're on some existential rant about how this is some sinister plot by the government so what the fuck do I know am I right?

damvl6o,kdog1147,I must be because that statement (much like the rest of yours) makes no sense. But hey I'm a reasonable guy and could be wrong. Do you have anything like evidence to back these claims up (especially that chaos from the south bit)?

dan3t7j,ElectedTuna,"True, I haven't found any figures on the proportion of dispensaries raided.

Cannabis has no lethal side effects whatsoever. To treat it like dangerous drugs such as cigarettes and alcohol makes no sense whatsoever. Cannabis should not be controlled. Period. Much like fruits you should be able to buy cannabis, grow cannabis, possess cannabis, consume cannabis and even sell cannabis wherever and whenever you want. End cannabis prohibition and end all cannabis regulation."

damv1bg,ZippyTheChicken,only problem is marijuana is different than alcohol or cigarettes.. there is over regulation of cigarettes.. the cost of a carton/10packs/200cigarettes is now about $75 and the actual cost to produce and sell it is only about $10.. No one gets high off of cigarettes and contrary to popular understanding MALPRACTICE is now the #3 Killer in the USA and that needs to be addressed because Doctors are not losing their licensesAlcohol on the other hand you can die from within hours but it is strong enough that you will passout from it at some point.Marijuana.. you can basically smoke from the time you get up until the time you go to sleep and unlike alcohol it has a different but just as strong effect on you.If you don't believe these things you are either lying or you have no experience.. The fact is Marijuana is a hard drug .. as hard or worse than Alcohol and it can ruin your life just like being an alcoholic will do.. Very VERY VERY few people can use marijuana for years but only use it on the weekends .. most people get mentally addicted and it will cause them to smoke every day.. their money goes to this.. money they shouldn't be spending and other parts of their lives suffer..You can not be 100% productive if you are stoned.. have a light buzz.. or even are feeling the mild effects a few hours later.. you just can't be 100% no matter how hard you try...And thats not good.. illegal? i don't know....But I do know.. most people that smoke pot are not responsible about the way they do it... not like they pretend they are...I can guarantee every person that has smoked for longer than 3 years who is an adult has done something they shouldn't have done. .. They drove stoned.. or buzzed.. they went to work stoned or buzzed.. they put other people at risk because they smoke weed and forgot what time it is and they got to get to work because this time.. this time they are getting fired for sure... and then they drive down the highway paranoid looking as hard as they can .. trying to stay away from others.. but its impossible.. they put others at risk.. And I am old enough to know this.. and I can honestly say I have NEVER ONCE MET ONE PERSON THAT HASN'T RISKED SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE BECAUSE THEY WERE STONED.... Vote me down I expect it.. But only do it if what I am saying is TRULY A LIE.. because its notShould it be illegal ? i don't knowwill it be used responsibly by most or all if it is?.. no chance in hell
damv59b,DrippyDehv,"Idk man it sounds like you've just never smoked before. It isn't nearly as big a deal as you're describing. It is most certainly not a ""hard drug."" Alcohol is far more dangerous."
damvbfc,ouiiouuio,">you just can't be 100%Thanks for the study. Why would you feel you deserve other people at 100% anyway? Why are you so entitled you think YOU matter?Stop being so entitled, this isn't about you or your sophomoric understanding of the world."
dan1txu,ZippyTheChicken,why me? ... why you...
damvle4,Oakley-Guy15,"Your comment all around is just wrong. Maybe you got mentally addicted to weed or know someone personally, but your anecdotal experiences means nothing for the legalization of weed. Now, if you can provide any sort of clinical study, not funded by the tobacco or alcohol industry, a lot of people would love to see it."
damxwuf,ZippyTheChicken,ok sure.. lie to yourself.. maybe the 100 people i knew that smoked pot were all genetically disposed to addiction .. think not.. Like i said you can lie to yourself but everyone has grown up in this world and seen it for themselves.. and I don't believe for a minute that you are that one case where you can say tonight .. right this minute that you will never smoke another joint .. take another hit.. and completely walk away from it cold turkey and have no problem at all doing it.. i believe like occam's razor what is more likely true is true.. and you are no different than anyone else .. you are not a super hero..
damyqfj,Oakley-Guy15,"Uh OK, that's not really a reply to anything I said, you didn't say anything at all. But along the line of what you're saying, would you think the same of someone who drinks alcohol? What about coffee or any caffeine? Processed sugar? Tobacco? I'm going to assume based on your mighter than thou comments that you don't consume anything I just listed, which congrats! But that doesn't make you any less wrong in your first comment.I agree that weed is addicting. Everything is, you're saying water is wet. That doesn't make weed harmful, since again everything is addicting and if you disagree than your just fooling yourself, right? You just don't like weed and are influenced on some bullshit propaganda so you think it's your duty to prevent anyone from having it. Check your ego at the door, your sins are no better than anyone else's."
damzjg6,ZippyTheChicken,its holier than thou not mightier .. im not trying to pin you in a ringand ... oh i like weed.. ever chew on a seed and pop the inside off the shell? its like popcorn .. or the smell of hash.. or digging through ashtrays trying to find enough roaches to make a pinner so you can wake up in the morning... I still remember being 3 years old .. I remember most of my life.. I remember what pot did to me and I am glad I got out in time because I never would have learned to code.. i never would have held half the jobs i have.. but then again I never ended up in jail.. I never hurt anyone seriously.. mostly myself.. and I count every day as being blessed because i see people around me and those i use to know that really screwed their lives up.. many of them are so called professionals.. but they are still screwups.. they will never reach their potential .. and you only get one chance at life....so why be stoned while you got that one chance...
dan07n5,Oakley-Guy15,"OK so you don't drink alcohol, coffee, smoke tobacco, eat processed sugar or fast food right? Why consume these things that harmfully effect your body if you have one shot?Because something has effected your life negatively, doesn't mean its the same for everyone else. Do you truly believe that no successful person smokes weed? Do you truly believe someone who smokes can't reach their full potential? If so, how can you think any different of those who smoke anything or drink alcohol or caffeine? Again, you're just picking one thing you don't like or had a negative impact in your life and applying it to everyone's situation. The world just doesn't work like that."
dan15us,ZippyTheChicken,stop trying to equate sugar with weed it makes you look like a drug addict that has absolutely no hope in this world but legalization so you don't end up in jail because you have no choice but to smoke weed until the day you die.... I didn't say people with some success don't smoke weed but one word##ALEPPO##and its not just me.. its not just my life its millions and millions of people who have had their lives changed by smoking weed .. or doing things that are harder.. and there are very few people that haven't smoked weed for an extended period of time and didn't try something harder.. whether its pills or meth or coke or worse.. and heroin is the worst it has ever been in this country because the cost is being held low because it comes from countries that hate us... like Afghanistan.. but like you equated sugar use with marijuana I am not equating heroin use with people that smoke pot.. the fact is just smoking pot is a pretty bad thing that people could live without in their lives.. because it takes away a part of who they are and of who they could become. and that on its own is enough.
dan27d3,Oakley-Guy15,"OK, except sugar has been shown to have the same addictive qualities as cocaine and the United States has an obesity epidemic. You thinking sugar is harmless is clearly ignorance. Yes, millions of people have had their lives changed by weed. People can use it as a pain killer instead of opioids, would you rather take opioids to manage chorionic pain? What about people with MS and cerebral palsy that have used weed to help them live their lives to a greater degree? Fuck them right because you got addicted to weed. Again, there are many things that are bad that people don't need in their life - alcohol, tobacco products and processed sugar, we don't need to consume any of these. But you don't seem to have a problem with any of them. In fact your ignorance of how sugar affects the body and its danger is troubling. All you're doing is spewing propaganda. Like I said, show a clinical trial proving your point, not paid by the tobacco or alcohol industry, and maybe I'll change my mind. But your addiction and problems with weed aren't everyone else's."
dan3s2x,skyburrito,"being lazy isn't due to smoking cannabis: it comes from personality. I know many people who are very productive using cannabis. Anyway, this is a personal choice."
daoqj8n,CiderWaffle,You've clearly never smoked pot.
damvbth,We_Are_All_Fucked,"So he says just as he is leaving office to helplessly watch his legacy disappear. Marijuana makes people stupid, lazy and often unemployable it is literally the NEETleaf"
damvexv,Oakley-Guy15,Your second sentence is ignorant and wrong. I imagine it's based on anecdotal evidence from one person you know. Do you have a poor opinion regarding those who drink alcohol and smoke tobacco?
damy6yu,chocolatevape,You're the stupid one with that mess.
damvrq4,TwistedAero,"Obama. We do not need another alcohol or cigarette for people to have. If we treat it like that it will be casually used and abused. No one should be a criminal for using it but it should definitely not be put in to such a petty state. It obviously comes with some of the side effects of smoking cigarettes and it also has mental side effects as well. If you really want to plight society with another drain on health resources, manpower, finance and services. Please just legalise it in a less controversial way so people don't think it is a controversial but cool thing to do."
damw89s,Maelst0rm,"We don't need it for that, sure but we also dont need prohibition on it. I think the positive effects out way the negatives. When it becomes legal i cant wait for all the study to come out on it, along with MDMA and LSD. i dont drink, i think it tastes bad, but i dont look down on people that do.(baring drink and drive and the like) i differently dont think of it as another plight, it has medical benefits. people dont need to go climbing and hiking and racing or camping, they could get hurt and not be there for work. I think it would invigorate the economy with the tax and job revenue along with the reduction in prison population. hopefully then the non-violent ones can get a job and start to contribute instead of being an unwilling drag on America."
damyzdm,TwistedAero,"Agreed that it shouldn't have a hard line approach because that point was not even handled correctly and that it's stupid to put people in prison for it. The tax on it, let's face it, isn't that much. I want medical research on it far more now rather than when it is legalised. Again, another thing that has been so unnecessary with this drug for both the pros and cons, mainly medical research would be good. The problem with it, is that it has both long term and short term cons. There have been some studies to show slow reactions over several days after use, it can have brain growth problems at young age, it can cause minor health issues. I think that perhaps creating a culture of a slight bit of rational self control and wise use would be advisable first than rather just letting it be a thing that is stigmatised"
damzij9,Maelst0rm,Totally agree. developing brains react and change based on with they are given. Age minimum like beer would be fine. the only part i disagree with is the tax revenue which you can see [here](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data)
damvxfm,RedditConsciousness,"ITT Reductionist arguments on a complex issueAnd I'd add, just because something is only as bad as cigarettes or alcohol doesn't mean we shouldn't be opposed to more things like cigarettes or alcohol being prevalent. And yes there have been negative effects in Colorado, not that reddit would ever post about it. There's no quick, reliable check to see whether drivers are too high to operate a vehicle safely, as there is for blood-alcohol level. More people are showing up to emergency rooms from marijuana related issues, and more minors are as well. Am I saying that it shouldn't be legalized? No. But the people who think it is a simple issue and that anyone who is against it is on the take are tediously wrong."
damvz4i,tjmax,I Hope not. That shit is force fed down our throats at an early age
dan5fte,google_you,- drunk drivers to death- high drivers to death as welllaw enforcement at least can measure alcohol level without drawing blood out.
dan5wq3,Odin707,Drunk drivers to death? How high are you right now?
daniqws,HandMeMyThinkingPipe,The presence of THC in the blood stream is not evidence of impairment like it is with alcohol. THC can stay in the system for weeks and impairment in general for cannabis is not comparable to alcohol.
danu7ur,google_you,"Ah I see. So, can I drive after smoking? Cause it feels good."
damlb2m,whothinksmestinks,"yeah, you had eight years to do it and you chose not to.Now watch as republicans do it."
damyc5y,stilloriginal,ITT: People acting like Obama didn't legalize it. There are now multiple states where you can go and get it. That didn't exist 8 years ago.
damyfjq,drachenflieger,"Nor did Obama do it. The states did, and the DEA (Federal Agency under Obama's direction) still pursues action against the industry in places where it is legal."

damenu8,,OK Mr. Anecdotal scientist. Have you heard of fetal alcohol syndrome?
dameian,Mitt_Romney_USA,Whoa... did you write this while... high?
damemyr,,"Damn dude, go to bed, get some rest."
damlg1f,Bocaj1000,"And in my opinion, we need to ban the sale of all three. When we do so, more people will be exposed to a world where there is no escape to be happy. You will need to actually take action against the people and culture that suppresses others' happiness. We could make a world where people can be happy without having to trick their mind with chemicals."
damndl5,HROmega21,"Then we should also ban TV, Internet, movies, and sports. Also music and art. These also serve as distractions and brief happiness."
damoao3,Bocaj1000,"Those examples don't use chemicals to alter the state of your mind. They actually allow your brain to stimulate you instead. There's a difference. Not many people seem to have stances on drugs outside of basic health issues.I've had to think about my stance on drugs for a long time. I've analyzed many aspects. For one, any drug with medicinal properties should be allowed medicinally, hands down. My other stance is that recreational drugs need to be fazed out of our culture. They have never offered any benefit to our society. Health-wise, they **change** you. With hard drugs, alcohol, and tobacco, it's pretty obvious. We're taught the health effects. With marijuana, it's slightly different. Marijuana is slightly harmful, but it mentally changes you. You become dependent on it (Not biologically addicted to it, but psychologically addicted). You start to vote for less drug restrictions, which subliminally allows more people to be brought into a drug world. You might not believe it, but this stuff actually happens and does affect others. Moral-wise, drugs allow you to falsely escape from the real-world. It's like cheating on a test. We need to teach ourselves, especially in this restricting society, how to become happy without the need for illegal substances and mind-altering chemicals. It will pay off in the long run (For you, and for generations down the line).Think of it as Adam and Eve in the Biblical story. Adam and Even were allowed to do anything, as long as they did not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. It was a test, presented to them by their god. Mentally rejecting drugs is the test that good culture places on you. You can do it, and there may not be extreme consequences, but you failed in the eyes of good culture. Ignore drugs, and you pass the test. You will be a better person because of it."
damon5p,HROmega21,"You're speaking about a Utopia, and beyond that you're speaking about *your* Utopia. There will never be a time when you tell people ""you can't do this"" and there won't be a sizable amount of people who will be *more* encouraged to do it. Absolutely drugs alter you. That's the point of drugs. But many other things alter us in negative ways too, chemically or not, but we don't discuss them. Furthermore, there's very little evidence that suggests that legalizing something makes its use spike long-term. Often it's the exact opposite - legalize something and it sheds the riskiness of it and is less appealing to many people. In conclusion, you're broad-brushing *every* drinker or *every* smoker or *every* marijuana user. Not everyone who does one of these is a fuck up. Doctors smoke pot, lawyers drink, humanitarians smoke cigarettes. We should be afforded the ability to make that decision (and live with its consequences) individually."
damnr6a,El_Paco,"Banning them will only create a black market (like there already is with weed)See: ProhibitionBanning it or making it illegal will do nothing. You can even see current examples from certain Muslim countries. Also, drugs and alcohol have been in use ever since people have been people, and probably even before (since [animals have been known to eat shrooms](http://www.npr.org/2010/12/24/132260025/did-shrooms-send-santa-and-his-reindeer-flying) and other animals will [eat fermented fruit to get drunk](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-alcoholics-of-the-animal-world-81007700/))What you're envisioning is a utopia that will never happen"

damlv0d,FoamHoam,"Neither cigarettes nor booze cause schizophrenia, moron Obama."
damn3g0,HROmega21,"While I have no doubt you could source some bullshit study to support your claim, you're an idiot for acting like tobacco and alcohol don't have their own health hazards."
dan3q10,FoamHoam,"There's no ""bullshit study."" It's scientific fact.http://www.schizophrenia.com/prevention/streetdrugs.html"

damo6l3,InsideItAllFeelsSame,Every single heroin addict I have ever met smoked weed years before they ever stuck a syringe in their arm.Just saying. Edit: The Yale School of Medicine recently conducted a study that supports what I am talking about:http://news.yale.edu/2012/08/21/teens-who-smoke-and-drink-may-be-more-likely-abuse-prescription-opioids-later
damohye,JebBaker,Just like every fat person you know started with a cheeseburger. Doesn't mean everybody who eats a cheeseburger in their life ends up fat. Of fucking course people who think it's okay to do heroine aren't gonna be opposed to doing the most low-impact narcotic out there.
damoqxc,InsideItAllFeelsSame,"Being fat is the same thing as being hopelessly addicted to heroin?When these people started smoking weed, most of them were terrified of heroin. As they developed a habit, their morals went out the window and they progressed to harder drugs."
damspp0,bogidyboy,So there should be laws in place to save your junkie friends from themselves?
damol1e,Black_Handkerchief,"I'm not sure where that comparison is going or what it is supposed to achieve. However, I am pretty sure I can make similar claims about smoking tobacco before smoking weed, or alcohol.There will always be people who start with something else or don't climb the stairs of pleasurable substances, but it is pretty easy to call something like this."
dampgwx,pk_,"And rode on a school bus, watched TV, ate fast food... such an ignorant fucking statement."
dampss7,InsideItAllFeelsSame,The Yale School of Medicine conducted a study that supports what I said:http://news.yale.edu/2012/08/21/teens-who-smoke-and-drink-may-be-more-likely-abuse-prescription-opioids-later
damq2im,pk_,"First that was a study on prescription drugs, second cigarettes and alcohol were MUCH better identifiers. That study didn't back up what you said at all."
damt8mz,bogidyboy,"If anything, it shows how much more addictive AND easier to obtain RX drugs are compared to marijuana. It's no wonder that people might resort to relatively stupid shit when they don't have safe legal access to the more harmless non-addictive option."
dampm8v,bogidyboy,"I've never ever wanted to do heroin before. Just saying. Marijuana has never made me want to do anything I didn't otherwise want to do. Just saying. Ya know what DOES make me wanna do things I wouldn't normally otherwise do? Alcohol. Just saying. I bet your junkie friends enjoy their booze too. Just saying. I don't see you ""just saying"" any shit about that lmao. In the future, try to refrain from ""just saying"" things unless you want to look imbecilic."
damqoyl,InsideItAllFeelsSame,"Firstly, you are not everybody, and I never said alcohol was any better. There are people out there who would fine if they and everyone else drove 90 mph on the highway. We put laws in place to protect those who wouldn't be fine. The country doesn't revolve around you."
damra4f,bogidyboy,"Driving 90 mph on the freeway is a physical risk to both other people's property AND their lives. That's why we require licensure, impose minimum age requirements, and enforce speed limits in lieu of making cars illegal altogether because *some people* can't handle it."
damr5lh,Nwsamurai,That's only half of a fact. It would be more telling if you could find what percentage of people never did anything again after trying weed.
damthay,bogidyboy,"""Marijuana is a gateway drug that is addictive and therefore has no place in civilized society. And OH MY GOD WHERES MY COFFEE ITS SO EARLY IM LITERALLY DYING OH GOD WHERES MY COFFEE"""
damvt3j,windy-,I've changed my mind about Obama. I thought he was a responsible and reasonable president. Never imagined he'd be sucking up to these drug addicts.
damy3ti,chocolatevape,Are you for real? Weed isn't addictive.
