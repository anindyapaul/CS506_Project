I've spent the last few days in pure disbelief and it just doesn't make sense to me. I've spent the entire La Liga and Group Stages watching Barcelona play great soccer it's just not fair.If Barca loses by at least 3 again I will face that the Roma deserved the win, but I am just 100% sure it was a fluke and does a big disservice to the Barca and UEFA."

dx5jxls,DobleseSays,love this thread
dx6s5gr,ElViejoHG,"No no, the other semifinal will be Juventus vs Sevilla. Like we all predicted"
dx5fjki,FreedomByFire,"Meh, Real Madrid still has to get through Sevilla or Bayern Munich. Neither one of which is a slam dunk, and I imagine a final with Liverpool could be complicated. That's the one team I wouldn't want to face without a double header especially with a leaky defense like Madrid's. Marcelo would have a hard time stopping Salah from running behind him considering how high he plays."
dx612mi,BoreManLou,As a Madrid fan I want to face Liverpool the least. (if we get through) though the Egyptian in me will be confused.
dx5bz0o,curious_Jo,"Wait, are Bayer munich pushovers now? Cause the ref helped Real a lot last year, with brutal offside goal and all that."
dx5cd8r,Apolo180,"as far as I remember, Bayern wrongly got a penalty in their favor in the first leg- that Vidal shot over the crossbar, though that is irrelevant. SO I wouldn't say Madrid only got through because of the referees, plus Bayern haven't exactly outplayed them in any of the games. Kept them on their toes, gave them a good run for their money. but never actually played so well that you can say they deserved to go through more"
dx5cteo,Theart_of_the_cards,And Mueller was ofside in the situation that caused the Ramos OG. And Vidal should have been sent off anyways before that discussed tackle.
dx5olqj,ragingasian15,"Wasn't Müller who was offside. He was in line when the pass from far back came.You could claim Lewy was offside when Müller passed him the ball, but you could also claim that Lewy didn't touch the ball, but *then* you could claim Lewy played the ball, and we could argue forever about that.It's all very icky."
dx5hx5x,Hiroxis,We were also missing Lewandowski in the first leg and he wasn't fully fit in the second leg. Not saying we would have won 100% but I think the matchup is closer than people think.
dx67282,Apolo180,I think so too
dx5kft4,Sarkaraq,"Well, it was Ancelotti Bayern - playing a completely different style. And due to injuries and retirement, Bayern may very well play only two players from last year's first leg.That's hardly comparable."
dx5cp3c,curious_Jo,"Yes, but my point is, you can't just say Real's CL is automatic. Also in a one game final against either Liverpool or Roma, I wouldn't say it's an automatic win."
dx5ops9,Fernando-Santorres,"And we (Roma) have a fair tradition against Real... 😁😁😁😁 To be realistic though, Real emerges as the clear favorite for the final Win."
dx5cnx8,TiltedTrumpTowers,"Too many RM fanboys here, but you're right man"
dx6ethv,ChiefRedEye,"over 2 legs you've had like 3 shots on target, we've had around 20. if i remember correctly, you also fouled us over 20 times in 2nd leg, while we had 6 or 7 of them. keep crying and hoping people don't remember how overwhelmed your team was by real last year, at no point you were the better team"
dx6m50g,TiltedTrumpTowers,"We won't find common ground here, although I do agree that you should have decided this tie at the first leg, when we were one man down. Second leg has been quite a dog fight between two superpowers and RM's toughest match of the last two seasons for sure in CL. Hence we weren't that inferior like last time with Pep.People here still have this 0-4 result on mind, whenever they talk about RM-Bayern even to this date. If our paths cross again, match(es) will be a lot tighter than they already were with Jupp GOATckes now. However, don't get me wrong here, you'd be favourites nevertheless."
dx5cuck,curious_Jo,"Apparently just because Bayern got a penalty in the first game, it makes it ok that the OT goal was an offside. I am not even a Bayern fan, I just like to be fair."
dx5dqoq,Apolo180,"nothing is carved in stone. I wouldn't even rule out Juve, and I'm right there with you when you say that it's not like the trophy has Madrid written all over it now. I can see liverpool beating them in a final. Even Roma, if they make it there, could defend till penalties and with some luck end up winning it, unlikely as it is. But like the others have said, besides the wrong call favoring Bayern in the first leg, Ramo's og came out of an uncalled offside position on the part of Muller. But for some reason- probably because people are tired of seeing Madrid winning the Ucl- everybody's been going around complaining about how unfair the referee was to Bayern, when if you stop and put things in perspective, the decisions more or less balanced out, no matter how you slice it"
dx5ozke,ragingasian15,"Refs are human, I agree you can't fully blame the refs for missing calls, although FIFA and UEFA should hold them to a higher standard. Besides, Bayern had their own luck with the refs in 2013.Btw, Müller wasn't offside in that goal, Lewy was in an offside position, although it can be debated on whether he played the ball.I'm personally pushing for VAR so we can rid the sport of this bullshit."

dx5d0sv,AcesAgainstKings,"I know you're probably joking. But if ""they"" were actually wanting to fix things they'd put Real vs Bayern semi final. Huge match with plenty of hype. Then draw Liverpool vs Roma giving Liverpool a better chance to make the final. An English side in the final for the first time in years against another European giant would be more marketable."
dx5dmjo,tanu24,Bayern and Real are the top teams in the world. You guys are easily behind them in marketability.
dx5e2hx,AcesAgainstKings,"I'm not trying to down play Bayern or Real. But if you draw them in the semis you get two matches or great quality football. Then you get a better chance of the weaker English side sneaking into the final which would draw in a huge audience. I believe way more than Real - Bayern anyway. I think football purists would probably prefer the latter, but the English league has much more exposure."
dx5o291,tanu24,Primarily English site so you'll get agreement but no chance. You always want the big names in the finals.

dx5k0e8,GL4389,The Final You mean ?
dx5rw29,maroonmartian9,"Nah, would like to have a repeat of the 1983 Final. 😄"
dx6ls3b,Onetr1ck_Zilean,LUL what? When bayern is in the semi finals it is obvious that bayern would play against roma
dx5czti,709869808654674,this champions league is so over rated
dx5c1ry,FrenchManc,"Liverpool was pot 3 in champions league and had an europa league run so far apart from city, how lucky can they really get."
dx5b430,wrdb2007,Congrats Roma What a performance!
dx5bc9e,Luis__FIGO,"In their last 3 trips to Italy, Barcelona has conceded 6 and scored 0."
dx5bv5z,gunsof,"Damn, Italy has the secret."
dx5e07v,kiritok,Italy is Barca's kryptonite.
dx5z0qv,SoLetsReddit,There's pretty serious athletic doping laws in Italy. Coincidence?
dx5b5j9,mike92574,Fucking insane. Never imagined they'd manage to pull it off.
dx5ctb8,Kuhrohnik,Neither did I!
dx5bpp1,Tsegen,Mad men.
dx5bepc,carabbaggio10,Fucking madlads
dx5bbaa,mightbeabotidk,"We didn't deserve to go through, at all. Embarrassing tactics from Valverde and embarrassing performance from the players. GG Roma win it all you absolute fiends"
dx5bhbk,jx8j,What in the actual fuck is up with umtiti?
dx5bw11,cokecaine,"The fuck was Busquets all this game? Semedo was outclassed. Subs came in way too late and seriously, Dembele in? Don't get Valverde tactics."
dx5cbqx,jx8j,"Valverde fucking giveths and takeths. But really out of all the games he has coached, this one was his worst and sadly it had to be one of the biggest games of the year for him to fuck it up. Busi was out of it as you said but who knows how this game would have turned out if Samuel didnt decide to just fucking give up in the first goal. Semedo... idk he had a bad game but I still have faith in him getting better but man it sucks it had to be this game he had to play poorly."
dx5c83h,Ham_Solo7,Ikr what the fuck is up with him? Horrible. Just sell him to Man United.
dx5cem7,jx8j,Mate I love the guy but those talks have been getting to his head recently. I just hope it doesnt end in a sour way with him.
dx5d8g5,Pirvan,"Agree. It was embarassing, it was painfully arrogant of Barcelona, no urgency, no fierceness. It felt like they were playing a friendly and sucking at it. We should have more routine, more staying-power and more will to win. Absolutely deserved Roma win and the sad thing is, Barca in proper gear for a half would demolish Roma.There is a lesson in humility here. I hope we learn our lesson."
dx5dhhm,mightbeabotidk,"Well said, lack of hunger for the win was very noticeable. We didn't want it hard enough. Should've 100% won this but we didn't wake up until they were already ahead 2-0 and then it was 3-0."
dx5txz5,jon_targareyan,That's just Valverde tactic: try and defend a lead. I don't understand why he just won't go for the kill when we have players like Messi and Dembele. Playing defensive takes away the special attribute that most of our players bring to the team.
dx5fnon,Med_rapper,They are exhausted.
dx5u25o,jon_targareyan,"If anyone has a reason to be exhausted, it's Messi, Pique and Rakitic. Messi and Pique have even been playing through injuries, coz we can't do jack-shit without them. It's a shame really"
dx68x8b,Med_rapper,"""They"".Paulinho is exhausted too"
dx5ef1q,MrLekkz,"From a brazillian fan: This was a typical Paulinho, I will never understand why Valverde chose André Gomes instead."
dx5cjtf,AvatarReiko,"What happened to you guys? I did not get to see it, unfortunately. Did Valve get his tactics wrong or were the players just get complacent. Did Messi not have an impact?"
dx5cwfr,mightbeabotidk,"Both. Valverde got it wrong and stuck to having Sergi Roberto on the midfield and Semedo on RB. Hasn't worked when he's done this, but he just did it again for no reason. The defense/mid was also in shambles, Messi actually had a defensive effort in this game, which was kind of weird to see. Couldn't do anything up front because we just never kept possession, and our defense was unorganized and fragile."
dx5brt9,danel_vadan,"LOL, this is isn't about ""deserve"". This is about the fact that Roma were superior and we sucked. Don't downplay it; Valverde blew it."
dx5bxgy,Malarazz,"> LOL, this is isn't about ""deserve"". This is about the fact that Roma were superior and we sucked.Isn't that what deserving means?"

dx5b8vg,-_-_-_-otalp-_-_-_-,Can't believe coutinho downgraded his club smh
dx5bqd7,Mekfal,Downgraded from a Semi-final team to some quarter-final team.
dx6fi12,nuclearboy0101,"I'm really worried for the Brazilian NT, with both Neymar and Coutinho downgrading clubs. The worst situation is Paulinho, though. Leaving a continental champion where he was the big star and the league's best player, to sit on the bench of some quarter-final team that keeps getting whacked 3-0 by Italians. Players nowadays trade trophies and glory for money and comfort, such a shame.At least our starting GK plays for a big club."
dx5bohk,masterpadawan1,"Never heard that name before, probably plays for a small club that got trashed"
dx5ezm8,MeatTornadoLove,Why a player would feel a move to a small country like catalonia would be a positive career move is beyond me...

dx5e1px,Stakoman,Holy fuck... I didn't thought about that🤔 lolAt least he's winning the league 🤔Congrats Roma
dx5bwvh,Z4Z0,Lol xD
dx5syaz,A_delta,"He simply couldn't handle the pressure, don't be too hard on him."
dx61k77,LoCelso4me,I still can't believe that transfer. Why didn't he wait until the summer? What did he have to lose by waiting until the summer? He wouldn't be cup-tied. He could have been apart of Liverpool's 'return to glory.' It confuses me why he'd force the Jan move.
dx6fp2l,mocnizmaj,"We shall see at the end of the season who will win trophies, and who won't."
dx5b9qc,Lepojka1,Barca played too defensive first 85 mins... They deserved that loss. That team should never play defensive. Roma played their hearts out!
dx5bi1o,Luis__FIGO,"All those years talking shit about Mourinho grinding out wins, saying it was easy to play that way..."
dx5g2wt,gunsof,They were so casual and Roma just played like they could do it. You could tell Barca came into it with the mentality that the game was over.
dx5bzp5,micossa,Tbf they did have a 3 goal lead against an inferior team on paper
dx5cfx6,sugima,"It's never a reason to play the game only to defend. If the opponent is really inferior, play at your expected level, or you stupidly take the risk of letting them score."

dx5dpgv,DanielAgger,No
dx5drvb,absurdlyinconvenient,Of course.
dx5kasa,mrsocool,Because Van Dijk went from relegation battlers to CL contenders
dx5xsfb,lebron181,Coutinho went from no trophies to winning titles.
dx5xtkp,mrsocool,He hasn't won shit yet pal
dx5z3zp,lebron181,It's a foregone conclusion.
dx5dqfn,masterofdisaster93,"Yes, because a league title and cup title is just useless too, right? Who am I asking, lol. You guys haven't won a league title for so many years you have forgotten what it is like."
dx5cnrv,H-Resin,You mean Portuguese?
dx5bqzh,tycoon34,Can we talk about how hilariously the Coutinho situation played out?edit: drunken spelling
dx5c2mw,Worldnewsusersarestu,"He coulda stayed, played in a champions league semi final, and parted amicably with great memories all round in the summer."
dx5chi7,DetroitDan24,Who knows if we're even here with him. Butterfly effect
dx5d0ts,Clubber_Langer,Liverpool have looked alot more balanced since he's left imo
dx5dxwm,chayatoure,"That's probably because of the addition of Virgil than the removal of Coutinho. That said, I think Klopp had to make some concessions tactically to fit him in, but it was probably worth it."
dx5e8hu,rcolesworthy,"Even when Couts was being an ass and faking his injuries we played very well without him. Virgil most definitely helped, but this season I think our overall team reached the point where we definitely weren't reliant on him"
dx5j4uk,Artharas,"Thing is though, imagine being able to rotate between Couts, Mane and the Pharaoh for LW/RW. We weren't reliant on him but without him we're reliant on our remaining front 3."
dx6rcvs,rcolesworthy,"We are heavily reliant on our front three, yes. If we lost any of them to a long term injury it could've derailed our season. We need backups for the wings badly."
dx5u9dc,wannabelife,"You are forgetting vvd's transfer was somewhat possible by coutinho's sale. Even if we had money prior to his departure, that sale gave enough confidence to splash 75mil in jan."
dx64l2s,getdivorced,"I think it's equal parts both. VVDs been great and Coutinho is a talented player going forward, but our midfield was incredibly easy to get through when he was apart of it."
dx5e15q,relevantresearch,Think VVD's influence has been greater in balancing the team.
dx5edln,longylongo,The confidence from Karius helps too
dx5f12a,relevantresearch,Aye he's usually more decisive than he was today though. Fobbing off hoofing it to lovren
dx5e1lx,returnofthecrack,Van Dijk?
dx5outd,imbued94,"Well, couts was still more or less as good as salah imo before he left. Scored his first hattrick etc. There definitively have been nice to have him in some of our slower games, but who knows."
dx5g7lr,NiceGuyPreston,i think its just made them play a little more mindful with the ball especially in midfield/defense
dx5phcn,idgaf_neverreallydid,"Nahh we would be better with coutinho, I think. He would produce the most out of any of the midfielders."
dx5dkma,ironshield23,"Probably not, he wouldn't have tracked back and make defensive contributions like Ox did"
dx5d9i2,Adrian5156,Probably would've smashed another couple past City tbf considering how much Phil loved playing against them. Still get fucked you little shit
dx5d436,LFCMKE,"If he played against City instead of Ox, we would have most likely lost."
dx5e6uq,RushJones,“IT'S LIT!”
dx5d91h,LeftHookTKD,He'll still win the La Liga
dx5dph1,Dank42091169,The the liga
dx5dloo,ritamk,I'm sure he didn't go there to win la-liga
dx5dul3,vSity,Well he didn't go there to win the champions league this year. He knew he couldn't have played. It was always a long term decision.
dx5ip0m,LeftHookTKD,HE wasn't eligible to play in the UCL this year anyway?
dx5e66c,froggyjm9,I'm pretty sure he still gets a CL medal if Liverpool were to win it. He played more than enough minutes in the tournament to qualify for a winners medal.It wouldn't have happen for with Barça so this is actually good for him. Winning a CL title without playing the other half of the tournament.
dx5r1hw,Worldnewsusersarestu,Lol Liverpool gets to choose where the medals go I think.
dx5ytgd,reddish40,Instead he gets a guaranteed league title and time to rest before the world cup. I doubt he regrets anything!
dx5yxdk,Worldnewsusersarestu,"A league title he did little to earn. Besides, is a league title really that special when you win it every other year?"
dx67p34,reddish40,A league title is a league title. Many players never win one in their careers. And this might be his first so I don't know what you mean by winning it every other year.
dx5emzu,fahrenheitisretarded,Instead he left and may very possibly go down in history as a member of a Barca invincibles squad.
dx5kk3v,mrsocool,History won't forget he was only there for half the season

dx5btvh,summerstein,Seriously though fuck him. Should have waited till summer to leave and play champo with Liverpool
dx5dugv,Hubbleshubbles,No one would have been able to afford him after WC2018.
dx5qlpw,SurreptitiousNoun,"Coutinho doesn't really deserve to play CL for Liverpool, he didn't play in either CL play-off leg amidst transfer talk. Then he goes and gets himself cup tied later on.All the work in the previous season to get top 4 (down to the final game), and he had no interest in seeing us beat the final hurdle to get into the CL."
dx5duqq,-Socrates_,"Doesn't work like that though. Any number of realistic factors could have between now and the summer that would have prevented Coutinho from moving. He wanted to move last summer and he didn't, clearly he left his window of chance was very small and took it when it came."
dx5qrqq,SurreptitiousNoun,Doesn't seem like his window was very small at all. I'm sure it was said that the summer was his one and only chance to move to Barcelona... then the winter was his second and only chance to move to Barcelona.
dx5dro0,masterofdisaster93,And miss out on a league title and a cup title. Yes! Logic much!
dx5ex1p,LP_AM_,Better be a key player in a team in Champions League semifinals than winning the league as back-up or played out of position.
dx5fe4o,masterofdisaster93,"What? He is winning the league and the cup. Those two combined are better than winning the CL, whichever way you like to turn it.>Better be a key player in a team Well, duh! Barcelona is a better team than Liverpool. Of course Coutinho will be more crucial of a player in Liverpool. By your logic Salah should have never left Rome. After all, better to be an even more important key player in Roma in the semi finals, than Liverpool. Right?"
dx5flfo,BludFlairUpFam,"How would he have been more important at Roma?The point was that they would have won those competitions without Coutinho, he isn't a difference maker this season. Liverpool wouldn't be here without Salah so it isn't the same at all"
dx5hv9l,masterofdisaster93,"> The point was that they would have won those competitions without Coutinho, he isn't a difference maker this season. And the point is that, that argument is pretty stupid."

dx5yvj6,EatingMcDonalds,Go watch how he took his penalty against France in the 2006 WC final to see how big his balls are.
dx5pg8c,Fernando-Santorres,It's Perotti which is injured... Then it's Dzeko but he decided to let De Rossi kick because of some bad comments that were made by some journalists for his own goal in the 1st leg.
dx5cwd5,FifaFrancesco,[Totti as manager and De Rossi as Assmann](https://youtu.be/rUOgEfE9Cf4?t=170)
dx5jgnh,patiperro_v3,Gives me hope for Vidal... I hope we get to use him till he is 34 as well.

dx5d3k9,Superbugg,De Bossi
dx5htn3,santadani,*De Bossi
dx623fq,vj_34,He won the old guard battle against Iniesta
dx5bf1d,sscspagftphbpdh17,Barca just got Barca'd
dx5cpqe,R3V1V3R,Except that Roma didn't get biased penalty decisions in their favour.
dx5cxvl,yoshi570,"I don't understand, they told us they were better without Neymar!"
dx5do3f,sscspagftphbpdh17,Your flair makes me not understand your comment...
dx63psj,yoshi570,I felt it was clear. Barcelona fans kept repeating that they were stronger without Neymar. That they would never take him back. Blah blah.
dx5dt71,GranaZone,we still are
dx5jjcy,gonnacrushit,"Frankly you're not. Even in la liga, you had soo many luckluster performances where you just wouldn't drop points. I don't know how you're undefeated, not even Pep could do that and the league was worse back then. I guess all the good luck Real had last year turned to you."
dx6gpbn,GranaZone,Then it was the same with neymar
dx5blt1,goosedood,More like we pulled a PSG and found a way to fuck up the unfuckupable. Roma was also fantastic tonight
dx5g3ks,Unlucky_Rider,"I massively respect Roma for this performance. I'm pissed at my team, but Roma showed balls that we just didn't."
dx5bpts,Potato_Trainz,That was one of the best games I've ever seen from a centre back from Manolas
dx5celr,ILookLikeKristoff,Honestly impressive from a mental resilience standpoint too. Such a reversal of his first leg game
dx5cjox,Hwoarang7,Dzeko was unplayable. Absolute masterclass over two legs.
dx5bqce,Steelkatanas,Raised by Wolves those players

dx5bquf,Knopfmour,"Tell.me about it, heard they threw away another lead to lose the game in the last 20 mins hahahaha that must be like the 6th time they've done that this season"
dx5cjue,TheJeck,Heard they spent more on a striker they don't use than every defender at the club combined! How stupid!

dx68i5k,redblueninja,"feel for you, man! I'd be sadder watching my captain go to everton though. Oh wait...."
dx6exdt,BoredBorderlineGeniu,"That wasn't even the worst. We lost Davinson Sanchez to Spurs, Traoré to Lyon, and our revolutionary manager Bosz who was probably the main reason for our success went to Dortmund. Klaassen going away also sucked, but he already played for Ajax for years and a transfer at this point was only logical, and he wasn't as irreplaceable as some other players."

dx5djul,Ghost51,Had no idea Pep sent Van Gaal down when he got banished from the touchline
dx5d3sm,ZeugeYeboahs,The Pep way
dx5d72v,isoldmywifeonEbay,"They all looked to De Bruyne to play the killer pass. It's like some of them lack the confidence when in a pressured game. Jesus was pretty absent most of the game. Aguero comes searching for the ball more often and can act as a CAM as players rotate and stretch opponents. Jesus doesn't quite have that.Understandable though, a lot of city players are having the best season of their careers and it must be tough to play naturally when that gets shaken."

dx5l2h7,chak100,"By the way, and with a lot of respect: I hope that Juve doesn't have this kind of comeback tomorrow"

dx5b4rx,MmmBappe,"What an incredible game by Dzeko, a very underrated striker. His away goal was crucial then today he scored and won a penalty, as well as being present in all areas of the pitch. Manolas was fantastic as well, stopped everything coming from Barca's attack. Whole team played incredibly well really, all credit to EdF."
dx5bq6p,Philostotle,He single handedly emasculated our defense.

dx5d061,nico130,Dzeko's hold-up play today was IMMENSE!!!
dx5feev,azzurri10,Remember when Dzeko was doing shit like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yTHyVcD40zQ). Funny thing is apparently he got contacts cause he couldn't see right then just turned straight beast. Great buy for Roma.
dx5x52v,qqqjel,great buy for every club hes played for. ill never forgive pellegrini for replacing him with bony.
dx5j4gp,demxala,"Manolas is on my FUT, he has earned a permanent spot!!"

dx5ccr2,MmmBappe,It happens. Suarez went a year without scoring in the CL.
dx5cjnf,AjaxFC1900,"CL is not the league where they faced among others Crotone, Spal during that period I mentioned"

dx5d1h2,AjaxFC1900,"So if youre Madrid, City, Bayern, PSG or any other team with money would you spend 60 mil on a guy who is 33 and goes on some 3 months dry spell?...guy played amazingly tonight but cmon...he's not underrated...Immobile, Icardi and Higuain are way better than him if we're only talking Serie A"
dx5ddvf,LeftHookTKD,">Immobile, Icardi and Higuain are way better than him if we're only talking Serie AThe only reason they would be considered better is because of their age. Skill wise Dzeko is definitely up there. If you don't think Dzeko is at the very least similar skill level as immobile then you don't watch football"
dx5defz,MmmBappe,">So if youre Madrid, City, Bayern, PSG or any other team with money would you spend 60 mil on a guy who is 33 and goes on some 3 months dry spell?...guy played amazingly tonight but cmon...he's not underrated...Immobile, Icardi and Higuain are way better than him if we're only talking Serie ANo, I never wrote that, lol. By the way, RM actually bid for him over the winter, so yeah...Immobile **way better**? What? Discussion over. What a ridiculous thing to say. When Immobile becomes the first player to score 50 goals in 3 of Europe's top 5 leagues, leads a team to two league titles (one of them being the first in 50 or so years), leads another team to their first and only ever title against heavy favorites Bayern Munich becoming top scorer in the process, becomes one of the highest scoring European players on the international level with 50+ goals, knocks a team like Barcelona, one of the best in the world, out of the Champions League with a 3-0 demolishing at home, then you can say he is 'better', but he is nowhere near ""way better"".Also, why not mention the season in the Bundesliga where Immobile scored only 3 goals in an entire year and was one of the worst strikers in Germany?"
dx5ebs4,AjaxFC1900,"You're talking about the past, Dzeko **was** worth 60 mil , hell even more after the title season at Man City, now you're saying he's underrated, I don't think so, you say teams bid for him in winter , 35 mil if the reported figures are correct. That's his value, I don't see any underrated guy, but a player which is properly priced"
dx5bkdr,pentrutaramea,no bias at all yeah ?but on the real. he played well
dx5bann,Octopus69,"Unbelievable. Barca looked so disjointed and quiet, Roma as a whole were very impressive. I watched the wrong game"
dx5detx,jeezijonne,That's what ypu get by playing defemsive against strong and physical side when you are one pf the best attacking sides. Also not doing chances until it was too late was good. Thanks Ernesto
dx5clyy,ti9a,Manolas and De Rossi scored own goals last week. Today they scored to knock Barca out. Elite mentality. Warriors

dx5biv8,anu2097,He was not going to get CL medal anywayEdit: I just realised Coutinho is a fucking ~~genious~~ Genius.
dx5bt1k,Prompus,He might now
dx5cmtl,OldFakeJokerGag,Imagine a petty revenge of actually sending him one if Liverpool wins lol
dx5e4lj,ritamk,"I think he would get a medal anyways from uefa itself, Revenge is best when served cold."
dx5t42x,ayotui,"He wouldn't, the medals are given to Liverpool and it's up to the team to distribute them how they see fit."
dx69ryc,thetouristsquad,Was his departure that bad?
dx67o9y,ritamk,"I mean, out of fair-play they might right?"
dx5gsj9,SZJX,Nah. He's entitled to get it per the rules actually.
dx5d4s1,boxhunter91,Does that actually apply? He gets a medal for starting with them in champions league group stage?
dx5oohr,Fortrick,"yes, same as Benitez who got a Champions league medal when zidane won it in 4 months lol"
dx5cljx,liokist,Liverpool choose who to give them to
dx5c87b,Koulditreallybeme,I've been wondering this. If we won would he get one?
dx5dmwc,Golden_Draco,Yes he would actually
dx5etzb,oohlapoopoo,Would or could ?
dx5gamg,Golden_Draco,Would. It's guaranteed he's get one if L'pool wins cause he played the beginning of the CL this season with them
dx5h1h2,oohlapoopoo,I figured uefa would give the medals to liverpool and itd be up to liverpool if coutinho's medal goes missing.
dx5hxed,Derole,"He scored 5 goals and assisted 2 for Liverpool in the CL. He's a snek, but he still deserves it somehow imo."
dx5w9ih,shadowoak,No rule regarding who gets a medal. Rule books just say the club gets 40 gold medals. I'm guessing its up to the club to decide.
dx5kidw,KlingonAdmiral,4D Chess
dx5g516,SloatThritter,"He's club tied to them in the competition, ya"
dx5vy8s,skapuntz,the only way for him to get one is if Liverpool wins. of course he would have the right to one since he player for you guys. he couldn't play for Barça
dx5buau,mrsocool,He actually has a better chance given our result
dx5c3gn,guiltbyc,He'll if you win
dx5bwl2,Reddits-Reckoning,He might still get one
dx5c0vg,anu2097,He will get one.
dx6hwp4,surehavealook,*genius
dx5bz4w,Banjo-Dog,He will when we win it for the 6th time
dx5vv39,skapuntz,I am pretty sure a player can't play in the champions league for two different clubs in the same year. So if Barça won the CL he wouldn't have the right to a CL medal since he can't even play for Barça
dx5byy3,Mightier-duck,"If we were to win, we should definitely give him a medal."

dx5c5j0,MoTheEgyptianKing,"Meh.. he will still ""win"" La Liga. No one will remember in 10 years that he actually didn´t do anything to win it so it doesn´t matter."
dx5cfmk,spareMe-please,Gold digger!
dx5mjtl,sirwolfeye,Emerson?
dx5d831,Igloo433,At least he'll win a league before Liverpool do
dx5b4rb,izcaranax,Great. Argentina needs Messi well rested.
dx5beug,marianodan,"Yes, now he will join the squad much earlier, same for the city players. It's bad for his confidence but we absolutely welcome any rest he can get."
dx5c6dh,miguel_is_a_pokemon,I don't think the player everyone seems to be calling the best of all time knows what lack of confidence feels like anymore
dx5d6yu,baldfarmer,Watching him play the past month you can tell he's not at 100% because he doesn't want to get injured before the WC.
dx5fzxr,miguel_is_a_pokemon,"Is that lack of confidence, or just lack of recklessness? It could also be neither, and just other psychology at play."
dx5cwiv,T-Rigs1,"I can't tell if you guys are being serious or not, he's only missing out on 3 (potentially) games."
dx5edck,marianodan,"Last league game is May 20th, UCL final is May 26th. He will now join squad one week earlier, maybe more if he can ask club to skip last game (since Barcelona will secure the league title soon). Having Messi an extra week makes a world of difference for us since Sampaoli is still trying to find the best formation."
dx5e3mk,flashywinger7,True. But they train with the club teams in preparation for longer than players who finish the season without cup finals.
dx5d5ve,xsonwong,It would be good news for his world cup dream.
dx5bl8f,,[deleted]
dx5bup6,Theart_of_the_cards,What?
dx5c3xy,EdgeFC,Wtf did I just read?
dx5biek,AnthonBateman,https://twitter.com/Akillo1981/status/979835643663667201
dx5fsah,stvrap79,That has to be the hands down funniest tweet I've ever seen!
dx5dlwt,Cheesebro69,And Otamendi will be well rested too!
dx5bn4i,GoldPisseR,Lol I don't have any expectations from that team.
dx5buq3,ZuReeTH,"Me neither, i have expectations from Messi"
dx5cj9o,GoldPisseR,There have many big matches in the past few years where Messi has went missing.He can not lead a team that disoriented to a world cup victory.The whole team has to up their game.
dx5cvv3,ZuReeTH,"Tbh no one can. Every world class player had help to win stuff,eventhough this team seems to be shit i still have hope they can actually be decent. I still consider is hard to be a playmaker and even carry your team,no one makes the play for Messi."
dx5eu68,yhelothere,This is good for bitcoin
dx5calq,EdgeFC,"Argentina also hopes that he doesn't play like shit, as he did today"
dx5cjdq,izcaranax,"This WC will be his last (at least as a starter), and last time he played for Argentina he made a hat-trick and got the team qualified virtually by himself."
dx6e5zk,GosuJaz,Nah by the next WC Messi will just play deeper. Maybe not at GOAT levels anymore but he will still be a top player.
dx5cpuz,EdgeFC,"Nothing against that, only saying that Argentina is expecting that kind of performance from him, hopefully not the one we saw today/last week."
dx5en3k,marianodan,"Are you aware he's been playing half-injured for the last 2, 3 weeks, right?"
dx5ddyj,izcaranax,We also expect a better performance from the rest of the team. Messi sometimes seems like a magician but he is not. Maradona didn't won the 1986 WC by himself. That team had a solid defence and 2 pretty effective forwards (Valdano and Burruchaga).
dx5cs95,solarandlunar,"This is something that is understated in my opinion. People assume Messi just can't be criticized or that he doesn't play badly enough to warrant saying he's in a slump but this is the type of game that demands things from Messi that he isn't able to give his team, which is defensive positioning.You can see Messi walk the field whenever Barça lose possession. Barcelona was attacking with 11 but defending with 10, Messi just doesn't give much in terms of defending. I know this is CRAZY but I think including Messi in a game like this was what cost Valverde the game. They were completely outplayed in the middle. With Iniesta and Messi on the field, that's HARD to do."
dx5enrk,ketzal7,I don't think playing Messi is ever a bad idea. Sometimes he's not at his best but you can't always expect him to bail his teammates out.
dx5oy47,solarandlunar,"I mean, you can't really argue with results. It's easy to say Messi shouldn't have played the game after the fact. I would have started Messi - I'm not saying that I'm a soothsayer and that I foretold that Messi was gonna choke all game long but when there's a problem in your sector, something's gotta give.I think this game proved that sometimes subbing Messi is the best thing a team can do. I don't think that's a controversial thing to say."
dx5kchs,HakunaMatata69,This was sounding sensible until you mentioned that Messi should not have been in this game.
dx5x72t,YourCrosswordPuzzle,Definitely the most insane comment I've ever seen upvoted on here
dx5xgop,solarandlunar,"Really? It's 'insane', is it? It's literally beyond the realm of human comprehension to suggest Barcelona might have functioned better defensively without Messi? PSG buys their way into a world class squad that folds when confronted by another world class team and they're a laughing stock... How's Barça different?"
dx5y3ts,YourCrosswordPuzzle,"Dropping Messi to focus on defence would be ludicrous, yes. Any manager that did this would be sacked shortly after I imagine. Who would come in to replace Messi, out of interest?"
dx5ywdp,solarandlunar,"A manager who blows a 4-1 lead with Messi and Iniesta on the field should be sacked anyway. Obviously something didn't work, I don't know why you're arguing with me.If I knew the solution, I'd be a world class coach. I don't know how to fix Barcelona. But it doesn't make Messi any less of a player to be subbed. And it doesn't make you less of a fan by admitting that maybe he lacks qualities that Barcelona could have used in this game.Iniesta was also shockingly ineffective, is more of a defensive player, and even he got benched. It's like I'm living in bizarro world, what are we even discussing? Barcelona played crap football today."
dx5z4y2,YourCrosswordPuzzle,"> I know this is CRAZY but I think including Messi in a game like this was what cost Valverde the game.I haven't said anything about Iniesta or the Barcelona teams performance. Just that this sentence is crazy, you were right."
dx5h3ei,is_pissed_off,"Messi wasn't shit today, he got no service whatsoever and almost made a goal by himself."
dx5jtd1,gonnacrushit,"Messi is a targetman, he doesn't get service."
dx5bna8,goosedood,This is the only thing keeping me from punching a hole through my wall
dx5ktni,TheKatzMotel,Not that it would really matter...
dx5svoh,Mywoodinbush1510,mans got blood in his eye
dx6p40g,ncocca,"The only solace I can find in this, thank you for pointing it out"
dx5cdp5,Tacticalfan,"so he can let down the NT one last time? For what? The fact that he has not won anything with Argentina and never moved from FCB will always be a stain. They have Otamendi, Di Maria, Higuain, Rojo, Mascherano and so many other players and still could not win. Last chance for him"
dx5d0tg,justafanpassingby,Messi will lose you your world cup because he prefers friends over talent.
dx5vmtz,CruyffsPlan,AHAHAH tell us more about what Messi wants
dx6626z,justafanpassingby,"He wants Aguero over Icardi, He wants Higuain over Dybala. He wants his friends instead of players who can't perform in NT shirt to save their lives."
dx66sss,CruyffsPlan,"And what about the Argentina midfield who does Messi want there? What about the warm up kits, who does Messi want as a sponsor? While ur talking to him find out how he feels about this whole Facebook/Mark Zuckerburg thing as well."
dx5dio1,izcaranax,Just sports tabloids talking. Messi wouldn't sabotage his own opportunities of winning. He is not an idiot.
dx5c89o,S3DaNGeR,"Messi is so overrated, always disappear when needed"
dx5d5rb,TheAllbrother,So they can get knocked out in the quarters too?
dx5dnfq,izcaranax,At least the team would play better. Did you see the results of playing with Messi and withouth him?
dx5eqgi,marianodan,At this point I would take an honorable QF exit tbh.
dx5b502,PegaponyPrince,Liverpool and Roma in the semi finals. Didn't expect both of them to knock out two of the favorites! Wonderful performances by both!
dx5bpzh,Yorkeworshipper,"Now, if only Juventus could wreck you guys tomorrow."
dx5dmeg,ks00347,I would just forget that today ever happened
dx5dul1,Hi_Im_zack,Well today I forgot that our last match ever happened
dx5iq0o,edca5,Don't worry I won't
dx5dsth,iEatPorcupines,This is CL Juventus though and it's CL RM.
dx5efs3,Bulgerius,"Stomp us in league, embarrass us in Europe. The classic Juve."
dx5inwr,GiovaOfficial,"Ok, to be fair we are ok in Europe, just not as good as in Italy when it comes to finals. Losing to Real is acceptable, although the result is embarassing and probably worse than the performance suggests (at least before Chiellini's fuckup and Ronaldo's beauty)"
dx5x7bu,Bulgerius,"Haha, I know. You usually rep well and then choke. Choke is probably a better word than embarrass. It's just crazy that Buffon has been to what, 4 finals, but has never won."
dx6p69z,ncocca,2 finals in 3 years is hardly embarassing
dx5ipng,GiovaOfficial,A man can dream… at least until the game begins
dx5bhe8,LordVido,Yeah great performane and now free way to 3rd Champions in a row...
dx5bn67,Really_Quite_Boring,Pray to Salah
dx5chbm,SchrodingerE,lol... Salah means Prayer.edit: spelling of prayer
dx5dbcc,iAmTheRealLange,It all makes sense now
dx5h5w3,THE_JEDI_SUCK,Pronounced differently but same spelling in English sure
dx5moxe,sirwolfeye,"Technically it means ""to be a good boy"""
dx5qwh4,SchrodingerE,"Salah:- when said like Sala-th = prayer (Arabic)- when said like sal-ah = advice/ being good/ following the right path (not really good boy) (Arabic)- when said like sa-la (not arabic, just Urdu/Hindi) = bastard (if said pejoratively) or brother in law (actual translation)"
dx5rrgn,sirwolfeye,"It's not that I don't know, I wanna make Salah look bad (mind the flair). صلاح (read Salah with ""h"" not really an ""h"" )= righteousness صلاة (read Salat) = Prayer"
dx5cgz2,ImSuperManly,He'll just pass the prayer to Allah. You gotta insist he deals with it personally.
dx5bya9,MoTheEgyptianKing,Well there is a reason they are favorites to win the CL every year. In the CL they would have been favorites against you too :)
dx5bw6l,ahmedalaba,Servus aus München
dx5byqu,aquadamn,"Roma just beat you guys and Bayern is still out there, Real are the scary beast but they aren't unstoppable"
dx5c97g,MadRedX,Liverpool v Roma. Fox only. No items. Final Destination.
dx5ell2,Bulgerius,Wouldn't it be better for Salah if that was the final? More intriguing final.
dx5ih28,NotEnoughFire,top tier comment
dx5hy3h,The_Ass-Crack_Bandit,Real wouldn't play with a mentality like ours today even if they had a 6 goal advantage
dx5f1nl,kratos61,Roma would get shredded by Real. Barcelona lost today because of their mentality going into the match.
dx5c1bh,ExcellentFinMoSalah,"We're a better team than you, leave it to us"
dx5eigt,Bulgerius,"I'd be scared as RM if I got Liverpool in 2 legs. I think they should be praying to get anyone else next round. They would surely be the favorite in a neutral venue one off, though."
dx5csc4,preddevils6,Hardly a free route. Roma just beat you lot over two legs.
dx5c086,FCB_Rich,Don't worry we got this
dx5cqs0,LordVido,"I hope so, but you gotta win Sevilla first!"
dx5ccar,Le-Padre,">now free way to 3rd Champions in a rowLOL it would have been a free way even if Barca had qualified. Y'all just got fucked by AS Roma fam, how do you expect they had any chance at all to beat CL Ronaldo and Madrid? That's delusional>But next year, come back with Coutinho and all those other cats, let's see if that makes any difference. Good luck to y'all"
dx5dqx8,gee_what_isnt_taken,Somehow you don't seem to be from Spain
dx5gprq,RealMadrid4Bernie,Who cares let him talk shit or are only barca fans allowed to do that?
dx5c3fv,-Thame-,im sorry what
dx5fhrc,Marcoscb,Your own fucking fault. Not RM's problem that all the 'actual teams' are taken out before even reaching them.
dx5it3l,candyman236,Do you not consider PSG and Juve ‘actual teams'? I don't think RM had an easy route at all. Dortmund and in-form Tottenham in groups aswell.
dx668xt,Marcoscb,"I do, that's why I put 'actual teams' between quotes. It's the guy saying RM have a free way that apparently doesn't."
dx5cwwj,EViL-D,1 of the favorites
dx5bras,mrsocool,City were never favorites
dx5cu5a,BSchoolBro,"Funnily enough, yes they were. Throughout the last couple of months I looked, bookies put them as favorites winning the CL. Obviously before the 3-0 at Liverpool."
dx5ybpy,not_old_redditor,"Yeah because bookies adjust their odds based on what people will bet, not necessarily based on reality."
dx6eeys,BSchoolBro,"That's not the only thing they use. Let's say some dumbass wants to bet a billion on Sevilla at Bayern. Yes, it will move the odds, but Bayern will always be favorites."
dx5d0nz,mrsocool,"That's absurd. Anyways, bookies don't make them favorites. They have never beaten a top club over two legs"
dx5ek40,BSchoolBro,"Bookies simply work the numbers. I don't know what you mean with ""don't make them favorites"" but statistically all bookies found that City was most likely to win. Probably due to league form, CL group form, people heavily betting on them, etc etc."
dx5euw1,mrsocool,"They were never in better form than the other top teams in the CL though, those numbers never accurately predict a match. For me, a team that has never accomplished anything in Europe were never anything close to favorites"
dx5fyod,Cheeseking11,You got downvoted but you are right. Bookies don't know jack shit outside of their odds predictive algorithms. People who watch football would never ever put Manchester City as favourites regardless of how well they played earlier on in the season for the simple fact they have never won the CL ever. Also their previous performances in the competition make them bottlers in the CL than anything.If Man City won the CL then that would be an upset not expected.
dx5g0td,mrsocool,"Thanks, my thoughts exactly"
dx5mu6l,Move_Over_Rosa_Parks,Then why didn't you say what he said before
dx5cal9,98smithg,Liverpool just get unlucky in the PL then? Like every other week apparently.
dx5cnxe,mrsocool,I'm not sure what you mean. My point is the CL is a different kettle of fish than the league. Liverpool lives for these games and City is quite unproven on this stage
dx5y9wh,not_old_redditor,"Liverpool Roma Sevilla Juventus, what a dream."

dx5c94v,raney24,"How does it make it worse? Barca was good enough to have the lead.Edit: Since I'm getting downvotes, I want to explain how your logic is terrible... Just looking at facts, Barca scored 4 goals and let in 4 goals. MC scored 1 goal and let in 5, how can you say Barca is worse after that?"
dx5coqs,crusty_musty,Yet not good enough to retain it?
dx5djw6,AlexDimitrios,"Don't worry give Barca fans their time, I'd be salty and irrational too if my team just blew a 4-1 lead. I just got banned from r/Barca for commenting I'm there to witness the meltdown, salt level on max right now."
dx5fc4m,raney24,I haven't heard any rational reasoning as to why I'm wrong...
dx5cxuo,raney24,"Right, but it can't be worse because both teams lost but one team had to be good enough to gain a lead."
dx5d547,HyperGlitch1108,Point. Well this could go either way so you're so bad you couldn't retain a 4-1 lead but you're so good you had a 4-1 lead
dx5dld1,xanot192,I'd rather just get rolled over than have a lead tbh. More heartbreaking and infuriating having a lead
dx5d4oj,iAmTheRealLange,Everyone makes jokes and memes about blowing leads. Nobody ever makes jokes about losing outright. It's a little weird

dx5b5my,thoth2,"How the fuck did we bottle this so badly? We played our strongest team FFS! This is embarrassing.Congratulations to Roma. You deserve to go through. Hopefully you, Bayern, or Liverpool stop Real if Juve don't.Edit: actually, it wasn't the strongest. We should've played Dembele and attacked from the start. Disappointing from Valverde today."
dx5bl0o,passivelyez,"EV decided to defend the entire game. Our team isn't built for defense, and when we do we concede multiple times. Like today."
dx5ccxv,7Thommo7,"Both legs he plays both rb options instead of using a right winger, and Dembele sees about 8 minutes of play. I might sound stupid but I had absolute faith in EV until this tie and now I feel like I have very little. He seems to be a consistency manager that can't step up to the occasion."
dx5d8en,justafanpassingby,"He fucked up before the game begin by not resting Suarez & Rakitic. He fucked by not resting Messi. He fucked up by not resting Roberto.During match he fucked by not bringing on Paulinho & Gomes. He fucked up playing tired Suarez, Rakitic, Roberto."
dx5f1lu,Huzzahd,"Biggest mistake was not playing Dembele earlier.Or rather, as a starter."
dx5ievh,The_Ass-Crack_Bandit,Agree 100%
dx5cj9w,passivelyez,I am in the same boat.
dx5idfy,The_Ass-Crack_Bandit,I find it so similar to Unai Emery's mentality last season against us.Maybe he just isn't fit to coach a strong team with a lot of pressure?
dx5d9lx,KamSenny,I'm so unsure of EV now! Could Barca bottle the 11-point LaLiga lead?
dx5dne4,7Thommo7,Nigh on impossible given it's all (and 1 cup game) they need to worry about now. I'm just hoping - since it's all they have at this point - that they manage the first ever invincibles and maybe a semi final team turns up against Madrid to stop them in the semis. Liverpool or roma go on to win the ECL in a refreshing and different outcome and I can be content with the season.
dx5eg8g,Darksider123,"> I might sound stupid but I had absolute faith in EV Yeah, that does sound stupid"
dx5fddj,7Thommo7,"I figured from all results so far that, whilst not playing the best football, he knows how to grind the result out of any situation. That hypothesis fell flat on it's face here."
dx5fqsn,Darksider123,> he knows how to grind the result out of any situation.He knows how to put people in defense and let Messi drag his piece of shit tactics to victory.
dx5cjr5,BiggJj,Yet Barca has defended super well the entire season?
dx5ct5o,passivelyez,"We defend well when we are applying pressure on the other team by attacking. Then, our defense doesn't have to deal with as much pressure and performs better. Furthermore, the other teams can't throw as many bodies forward as Roma did, so we have some breathing room. Whenever we play defense only, we get thrashed because we aren't a team that can park the bus. Our forwards can't defend for shit and our midfield isn't very good when playing defense either."
dx5egch,BiggJj,Interesting. Are there any other examples of this happening? - If you aren't too gutted to tell me at the moment that is
dx5ejgw,passivelyez,"I don't really have any off of the top of my head. But last season, LE tried it multiple times. Every time we would concede and most of the times we would lose/tie."
dx5cfhq,Alfrredu,Nah dude Rome were just too good. That pressure killed us
dx5clyr,passivelyez,"They were, but that doesn't detract from EV's ridiculous tactics. Just because they were too good, doesn't mean he read the game wrong and we played like shit."
dx5daeg,baldfarmer,"Yeah we should have gone 4-3-3 with Dembele playing and Sergi covering for Busi. And we shouldn't have sat back, like we tried a Mou bus and got fucked."
dx672k7,mutheadman,Barca were horrible and let Roma do whatever they wanted
dx5dyir,rodinj,Parking the bus worked out fine for Mourinho in the CL makes sense for EV to to the same /s
dx5ezya,SkyFoo,"First time since the RM supercup game that they concede more than 2. Barca have been really solid on defense overall this seasonI just think your reasoning takes too much credit from Roma, scoring 3 against this Barca is a very difficult thing to do no matter how bad they played"
dx5fa5j,passivelyez,"Have you seen us play this season? Because I watched every single game. This was the first time that we were trying (miserably I might add) to park the bus and run out the clock. We NEVER played a full game like this, this season. We always attempted to score, put bodies forward and applied pressure. In the first 83 minutes of today's game we didn't do shit. Then, all of a sudden we started attacking. I'm not trying to take away anything from Roma. They played brilliantly, but we were abysmal and it was because of the EV approached this game."
dx5fp9k,SkyFoo,"Yeah thats fair, EV probably got overconfident about his defense and the result"
dx5bfrn,Morgan_Freefarm,i scrolled down a fucking long time there to find that flair loool fair play to you for turning out mate

dx5eamf,what_the_frank,"Just this once, for the memes?"
dx5bt8v,scarecrowslayer,"Half the players looked exhausted, the referee allowed a very, very physical game, and Valverde's tactics were ultra-defensive when one goal would have finished off the tie. Two of those three things are on Valverde, and they should be used to the third because Barca have not been protected by refs in La Liga at all this season. So, really, it's all on Valverde being a coward and doing a shit job of managing players over the last week."
dx5bi9g,desert40k,I would assume your tactics. You started playing when you were 3-0 down.I don't know why Barca didn't play like this when the second half started.
dx5c0qf,PM-Me-Your_Desktop,Have one of the best attacks in the worldOnly uses full power after you're 3 goals behind
dx5f2km,Huzzahd,Tbh Suarez is in terrible form

dx5ikqn,The_Ass-Crack_Bandit,Valverde was contradicting himself in the Post-game interviewI think he just had no clue
dx5cexq,roxy031,"No attacking whatsoever until we were down 3-0 and with 6 minutes left. Really awful decision to give up their style and just play defense. We didn't deserve to win, congrats to Roma on a well-played match with lots of heart."

dx5d4gz,yoshi570,"I don't understand, your squad is better without Neymar, isn't it?!"
dx5btr5,Newklearish,Question for Barca fans: do you think a managerial change should be considered at the end of the season?
dx5by9w,Kayhead996,I personally do
dx5cr4g,yummycoot,"yeah, EV thinks he's still at Bilbao, reliant on one player only. He expected Messi and iniesta to get a result out of it but they were not even playing in their proper position, defending like crazy. ultra defensive is not barca's style. 442 sucked to 352."
dx5cf7t,ceaguila84,"I do. He's getting results because of Messi. But his style is too pragmatic for this Barca, too defenseive at times and he doesn't fucking rotate. The players are exhausted"
dx5dj0w,crnimidzet,"I would say so. Valverde did amazing job in la liga, but the way this Barca plays is not the way I'm used to and not the way this players should play. I don't feel excited watching this Barcelona and only player that excites me is Messi. Valverde can stay, but he needs to stop playing so cowardly and rotate much much more (everybody looked exhausted today). Also I would say that Valverde hasn't tactically outplayed anyone this season it was all individual brilliance."
dx5dd2l,Igloo433,"No, we haven't lost a game in the league."
dx5cek2,passivelyez,"I think it should be considered tomorrow if not today. EV is done and should resign. blowing a 4-1 lead isn't something that should be tolerated by our club, especially with our squad."
dx5cqro,mixlpixll,Considered? EV should pack up his bags and leave the club ASAP.
dx5bxff,triplechin5155,Shouldve played Dembele. Half the team is exhausted
dx5c4mv,irishcule,"The team look extremely tired and deflated, I'm not really surprised by this. We were actually pretty lucky in some ways against Chelsea but nobody seems to acknowledge that."
dx5cg3n,Radinax,Tired team.
dx5cm5p,yummycoot,"its EV, he saw the team was struggling but didnt make any change until 80th minute and who he brought on? GOMES! the player with the least contribution since we bought him"

dx5cfcn,passivelyez,"> I think it should be considered tomorrow if not today. EV is done and should resign. blowing a 4-1 lead isn't something that should be tolerated by our club, especially with our squad."
dx5cfoa,MandingoPants,"Having Dembele in the starting XI would have been our strongest team, IMO. You can't press all game if you are being choked in your own area. This was a worse performance than the first game against PSG. I am embarrassed. Granted, exhaustion is probably an underlying cause to shit fucking shitshow we just witnessed."
dx5cupe,Source_Wiki,"No, the strongest team is 4-3-3 with Messi Suarez and Dembele playing in front. Not 4-4-2 where Roberto is playing RM (or w.e the fuck he was playing, he seemed absolutely lost)."

dx5ca7n,GloryKnight,I have no idea how Fazio didnt get sent off after that two Hits on messi and iniesta or Jesus after his face on suarez. And what was that penalty? Dzeko is Holding Piqué like a mad man and pushes him through the Box.

dx5fyrg,ShadoAngel7,"No. Deportivo, Barcelona, and Roma all lost the first (away) leg and then won the tie at home.Juventus would be doing the opposite, trying to lose at home and then win away. It's certainly possible just so incredibly unlikely. 3-0 would go to added time and then penalties. 4-1 or 5-2 (etc.) sees Juventus go through on away goals."

dx5coqb,ShomaliParty,No

dx5ce4r,gandhihasagrapehead,I can imagine travelling to Las Palmas is quite enjoyable tbf. It's not Sunderland.

dx5ddkv,HistoryofLord,Your own coach has stated his desire to win the domestic title that eludes him and emphasized the difficulty of a domestic title over a European cup. But keep on being the stereotypical ignorant madrista.
dx5doen,zyndr0m,LMFAO how fucking salty can you be?
dx5gagn,ChinggisKhagan,Messi is more than a class above Ronaldo
dx5xd3u,Philostotle,Barca is indeed at the moment only a QF team but Messi is still a class (or two) above Ronaldo. Madrid being a better side doesn't change anything.
dx692jm,OnceUponATimeInMars,Don't waste your time arguing with imbecils. Most of us know Messi is on another level compared to any other player. It's so easy to notice that.
dx5bdb7,farzadviper,Well you haven't qualified yet either sooo
dx5bpv6,callzor,But Real has won 2 times in a row. they know CL football. What have barca done since '15 except getting spanked by Atleti
dx5chrx,NeoLies,I love to shit on Barca (and more so today) but you talk like 2015 was 20 years ago or something.
dx5cvwk,callzor,It was 3 years ago. And no team except Real has been the European Champions since then. Also Real won it the year before Barca.I just fuckin hate barca
dx5d27n,NeoLies,"> I just fuckin hate barcaThen it's all good sir, carry on"
dx694le,OnceUponATimeInMars,Liverpool fan talking about getting spanked. God damn. Get off your high horse for fucks sake. You don't deserve to mock a much better team.
dx6hrpw,Pardonme23,Watched Messi put in passive performances because he likes to play deep instead of watching him going up front and scoring goals.
dx5e049,y0uveseenthebutcher,wtf are you talking about spanked? Barcelona have won more CLs in the last decade than you've won trophies total.
dx5g2eu,Marcoscb,TIL 2 is bigger than 5. Liverpool and Barça are tied in total trophies.
dx5l2nu,y0uveseenthebutcher,"Liverpool trophies in last 10 years:1 League Cup 2012Barcelona CLs in last 10 years:2009, 2011, 2015Next."

dx69m0i,thetouristsquad,"that Barca loss is a good warning shot for Madrid. I could imagine that they would have played below 100%, but now they have been warned and will play 100%."

dx5bfbx,neelr7,I'm more happy they don't have the chance of getting their treble though

dx5bpi0,ITsLoverBoy,Bruh you havent qualified yet either.
dx5cbjb,Greaves-,You've still got Juve to beat man
dx5bjqr,GoldPisseR,Ronaldo is coming for that 6th Ballon d'or.The man has the champion gene unlike any player in his era.
dx5fmd1,signed7,Whos the oldest ballon dor holder so far (at time of award)? Feel that he can give it a shout imo
dx5wzgg,BanterMasterGid,"I think Cannavaro in 2006 was like 34, so Ronaldo is close by. Man that's impressive."
dx5bng1,funkyfish,It would be hilarious if this bites you in the ass tomorrow.
dx5c16v,SwarlesSparkleyyy,"An absolute disgrace. Makes Alcorcon look like a normal loss. I hope Valverde is fired. I don't mind not winning the CL - and his league stat is unpredencted - but the game has been fucking dire for most of the season. I'd rather take a chance with Paco Jemez and watch beautiful football than watch Valverdes boring football. It's fine if the comments is calling me out on being spoiled, but it was supposed to be about how you played at Barca, not just the result. That's gone. It's all about the result. And when EV doesn't have that, he's in trouble. Basically I'd rather see Paco Jemez play 3-4-3 than watch another 4-4-2 match."
dx5bi98,Bobb_o,Might want to watch that hubris.
dx5blwv,Zimbelboi,I don't want to make you anxious or anything but we will ~~not have any CBs for~~ only have Varane who's 100% fit tomorrow
dx5c2gk,Radinax,Vallejo will play
dx5d3xx,Zimbelboi,Most likely but he won't be at his best and that's what we need from him when neither Nacho nor Ramos can help
dx5bpju,ReddTor,Zidane must be SMILING
dx5bxon,SgtPepe,You qualify first too.

dx5d5mb,styles__P,I'm a Barca fan I'm this made me lol cuz it's true
dx5kjep,TeKaeS,Can someone find the thread were Barça and Madrid fans wanted to draw each other in semi ? They were sooo many cocky Barça fan in that Thread. It was before the first leg against Roma btw
dx5ci11,Dyalibya,You haven't qualified yet
dx5b4ql,malcono,I'm just here for the memes lads.
dx5bku8,grawlyx,> implying /r/soccer has any value otherwise
dx5c4nj,dekszter,"You can get updates fairly quickly here, and ...... yup that's it."
dx5d24y,Bobojack,Instant Goal replays are nice too
dx5cn0p,Dyalibya,You can get the goals for matches you aren't watching much better than most places on the internet ....but the memes are the best
dx5bj6m,Source_Wiki,"The single worst decision of Valverde managing tenure is to try and hold a 4-1 lead going into tonights match. He should have never put Sergi Roberto and Semedo on the same side together. That's just more proof he tried not to lose rather than try to win. Dembele should have started, and if anything should have been on over either Roberto or Semedo at half time. Hopefully he learns from this, but that was absolute atrocious managing."
dx5bzxs,Fruit_Pastilles,"TBF, if this was any other team, no one would've seen anything wrong with it. Going into an away match three goals up, sitting back and playing defensively would've been the obvious thing to do, right?"
dx5c7eu,Source_Wiki,"You would think right? But, Barcelona proved this not to be the case last year when they beat PSG. PSG came in thinking that the 5 goal lead was enough, and they just parked the bus for the whole. Absolutely backfired on them cuz they didn't put any pressure on Barcelona to try and defend. This let Barcelona have majority of possession (think it was ~70%), and they had like 15+ shots. Always play to win, doesn't matter if you're up 1-0 or 4-0."
dx5czwg,Fruit_Pastilles,"True. At the same time though, Roma aren't Barcelona.Even looking at the other match today, Liverpool only had 31% possession and five shots, and they won 1-2."
dx5desp,Source_Wiki,"Looking down on teams is exactly what lost Barcelona this game. ""Cuz they're not....."". The difference in that Liverpool vs Man City game is that Liverpool didn't just park the bus all game and actually played aggressively trying to score more."
dx5dpkm,Fruit_Pastilles,"City were all over Liverpool from what I saw before switching over. And considering Barca had 57% possession and nine shots (I didn't see the full match so this is what I have to resort to), it's not like they just parked the bus all game either."
dx5fezi,marko911,More like valverde needs to be sacked for this garbage. Out team needs a big personality as coach and we haven't had it since pep.
dx5frhp,TheZunker27,Mate youre undefeated in the league and in the cdr final. This may genuinely be his first mistake so far and you want a new manager. Also pep hasnt won the cl since he left
dx5ix7t,The_Ass-Crack_Bandit,"Well, his first mistake is when he really shouldn't make one but I agree that sacking him would be too much"
dx6iav4,marko911,This was a mistake so grave by Valverde that it said everything we needed to know about what kind of manager he is. Thats why I want him out

dx5nn37,_dkb,"What kind of banter does that mentality bring? ""Oh, I better not say anything now because tomorrow is our game so I better play it safe. Oh, in fact maybe I should just wait til we maybe win another CL title and then I'll talk all the shit I can. But wait, there is always next year so better not laugh until....""This happened today, therefore you laugh and banter today. Tomorrow is tomorrow's problem. We're doing banter, not deciding on our yearly budget."
dx5by2z,James12052,"""We want Madrid in the semis. We're the only team who can beat them"" JAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA"
dx5c27h,Dentingtea,You guys really shouldn't be all that relaxed. You could spill a 3 goal lead like Barça. Dont laugh till it's over
dx5c7va,James12052,Sure we will! JAJAJAJAJAJAJA
dx5cdv1,Masterpicker,It's Real and CL. They'll somehow find a way to make 3 more goals in last 10 minutes.
dx5dp1v,AlexDimitrios,You would make a great Arsenal fan!
dx5dpun,Dentingtea,Why's that?
dx5dr7j,AlexDimitrios,Have unrealistic hopes
dx5i1xs,Dentingtea,"Eh, is it that unrealistic? I'm not saying you're gonna struggle or something, but with football, you don't know who'll win. Also, I fucking hate Juve. Why would I hope that they'd beat you? Hell, I wish Ronaldo would score 10 bicycle kicks tomorrow. It's fun for me to watch them get knocked out."
dx5bpja,xNateDawg,You mean like they did last year? And a week ago?
dx5by02,Dentingtea,"Yeah. Who knows what'll happen? They might lose, you don't know."

dx5f1gw,DemetriusXVII,What is he referencing here?
dx6lri9,zidaninho10,Madrid fielded Cheryshev an ineligible player in a Copa Match and were subsequently disqualified.
dx5bpyf,prashantchvd,Fuck my life. It was our poorest performance and we chose the wrong day for it. They bossed us from the first minute. Pathetic. Roma deserved it fully.
dx5b5n7,Mattilo232,PSG send their regards
dx5b6cv,thlimreaper,"Roma absolutely deserved to go through, that was a heroic display. They attacked Barca all game with Dzeko bullying Pique and Umtiti. Credit to Roma but that was also one of the worst games i've ever seen Barca play. There were absolutely no creativity in their midfield and forwards but usually they get away with it this season due to Messi's brilliance and a rock solid defense. But when this is the result when they played such dull football and hope to ride out the first leg's result."
dx5cd75,somario14,Thanks for giving some insight into the game. I am at work missed it but wondering how it happened. I had to scroll down an insane amount of useless comments.
dx5ikrl,thlimreaper,"yeah no problem. it's fun to make jokes but there're a lot more to take away from a game like this. Roma got their tactics spot on this game especially with the way they bypassed Barca's midfield by sending balls over the top to Dzeko and Schick. They also punished Barca's lack of actual wingers by pushing their fullbacks forward in support. This particular result for Barca has been a long time coming though. They have been playing really really dull football recently, just uninspired. It was just a matter of time before a team punishes Barca for their complacency and Roma did just that today."
dx5c1cq,triplechin5155,The midfield looked absolutely lethargic and the tactics were all wrong. Played afraid up 4-1. Dembele was needed to punish Roma pushing up so high
dx5iswf,thlimreaper,"Yeah I don't know why Valverde insists on playing the Roberto+Semedo combo on the right, it just doesn't work. There's no attacking threat at all from that side with that combo."
dx5jpjs,triplechin5155,Yeah Roberto is gassed as well. Hes not as sharp further up the field right now. Dembele could've punished Roma when they were stretched
dx5bzw4,StopMakingScents,"Defense was shambolic. Horrible mistakes from Pique, Umtiti, and Semedo all led to goals."
dx5cvyt,trashfu,Absolutely deserved. They were unlucky to not score more in the first leg aswell.

dx5b50a,Kold_Blooded_Killer,Barcelona feel how PSG felt
dx5b4re,AlgosForCryptos,and the winner is Real Madrid...
dx5bg4x,Bobb_o,You don't think this gives Juve more confidence that they can pull the upset?
dx5bw3b,Darksoldierr,"This also wakes up Madrid to not to take it easy, its a double edged sword"
dx5lmj2,Rakulon,Frosted tips never take it easy
dx5mze2,Schwiliinker,Oh god my sides
dx5lgq2,s1me007,Everything's a double edged sword
dx6b2ln,JuventusFootballClub,Real Madrid never takes it easy
dx5brtn,Ned84,Quite the contrary. This gives Madrid the biggest boost to push on. Barca were the only team that could beat them on paper.
dx5c6bw,aquadamn,"Bayern is out there, Liverpool just trashed City, Roma came back after an heavy defeat versus freaking Barcelona and Sevilha tough tooAll of them have teams capable of challenging Real Madrid, Ronaldo is something else right now though"
dx5c8bm,Ned84,Non of them could challenge Madrid like Barca. Don't get ahead of yourself.
dx5f4aj,ahovahov8,"Bayern could definitely challenge Madrid. I agree though, Barcelona is the only megathreat on paper"
dx5f7sr,Ned84,I have my doubts. Bayern under Pep were stronger than today and ate humiliating losses home away.
dx5gng8,ahovahov8,"Bayern with Heynckes have beaten Madrid before, so I'm confident they'd at least put up a fight"
dx5golp,Ned84,That was almost an entirely different squad that was built by hyenckes himself vs a Madrid that was not even half the Madrid under Zidane today though.
dx5iq3p,prime710,"No Mourinho's 11/12 Madrid could definitely match Zidane's. 100 points in the league, 120+ goals scored, prime Ronaldo being fed by inform Ozil and Di Maria, and the team that beat one of the best teams of all time to the league title. We were way more consistent in the league in 11/12 then right now."
dx5lsyt,Rakulon,The thing is that while that team was amazing....CR7 walks around in knockout games these days like a fucking specter hanging over the other team. They start mentally defeated and only Barça could point to Messi and say “we've got this guy it's ok”
dx5d7t0,Electric_Pegasus,"Barca just blew a 4-1 lead to Roma mate, they might not be that good in the CL."
dx683tk,TimeFingers,"It was a bad game, bad tactics and bad mentality because they thought it's won and just tried to defend. We could still beat anyone in the UCL on a normal day."
dx5d6lh,tanney,Crisitano ballon dor
dx5ca59,naroays,I'd pick Klopp's Liverpool to beat Real (or Barca for that matter)Klopp is a genius.
dx5cbgy,Ned84,Not impossible but unlikely.
dx5dim5,Lionsman3,What the fuck are you people smoking? Klopp knocked out Real with BvB in the semis once already... Are you guys all football fans since 2016?
dx5e1sz,Commandophile,> Klopp knocked out Real with BvB in the semis once already... And then the reverse happened a short while later...
dx5e3xt,Lionsman3,"Did i say he would surely dominate them or did i answer to a guy calling it ""unlikely""? It's far from that."
dx5ead0,Commandophile,and maybe BvB coming out on top over Real was an unlikely result.
dx5dl3g,Ned84,TIL Klopp is the guy playing on the pitch and not the players.
dx5dt03,Lionsman3,"... I see, you can't reason with stupid, so have a nice evening."
dx5dz4c,Ned84,Stupid? What are you 12? Go to bed.
dx5cgcz,PrrrromotionGiven,"Well if we're doing it like that, why not just skip straight to a Barca-Real final every year and do away with all the early rounds? After all, any other team is unlikely to beat them. Stupid outlook."
dx5dzrd,Commandophile,"O_oAll he was saying was that for Madrid, the team most likely to defeat them went out so they will be all the more spurred forward. I don't think he at all was saying that other teams participation is pointless- clearly upsets happen- but it's no lie to suggest that barca are overall more likely to progress far in the competition than most other teams in Europe."
dx5dayb,naroays,In Klopp and the Gegenpress we trust
dx6fdne,Conspiranoid,"Let's be real, tho... It just takes 90 awesome minutes for the opponent, and/or 90 shitty minutes (see: many 17-18 Liga games) for Madrid.No matter how godmode-y they look this year in the CL, their performance in the Liga/Copa has made me not trust the team enough to think they can't screw up and fail miserably."
dx6gq3m,Ned84,Nobody is saying ohtherwise. We are talking about the likelihood of that happening.
dx5f990,educatedfool289,They did get beaten by Spurs
dx5fbgb,Ned84,Who got shit on by Juve who got shit on by Madrid. Doesn't work that way mate.
dx5g0r7,educatedfool289,"I was more hinting that ""Non of them could challenge Madrid like Barca"" is not entirely correct."
dx5g889,Ned84,That's factually correct if you have seen their recent head to head and what Messi has done to RM.
dx5mxk0,Rakulon,Knockout frosted noodle Ronaldo tho
dx5g374,aquadamn,"Bayern can if players don't get sent off. Either way that doesn't matter, the other teams have a chance too"
dx5mv0k,Rakulon,I hear you in principal but in reality everyone is out there hoping to dodge apex predator Ronaldo
dx5dupu,jorsiem,"Bayern got wrecked last time they faced RM in semis, they struggled against Sevilla. Liverpool might be good but not enough to beat RM in beast mode neither is Roma, but then again anything can happen so there's that."
dx5cjsl,dnbVice,liverpool didn't trash city at all.
dx5fw4u,BludFlairUpFam,5-1 is a thrashing
dx5hcck,Chuuni_,"City had crucial decisions go against them at key moments. In the first leg, Salah's goals was slightly offside, Sane's goals at 3-0 to make it 3-1 was wrongly rules offside and another wrong offside call against Sane just before halftime in the second leg which would have made it 3-2."
dx5iugy,BludFlairUpFam,"Salah's goal was offside and that is fair enough bit only one Sane goal was wrongly ruled offside, I'm not sure what the other one you're referring to is"
dx5cixa,ShadoWalker3065,"Liverpool admittley got lucky on a lot of calls. No one can know for sure what will happen now. Bayern, Liverpool, Roma, and Juve will probably be the semis and any two of those teams can make it."
dx5ivgd,Dylz919,Lol.
dx5cpkt,BiggJj,Bayern and Liverpool certainly have a shot imo
dx5j0gb,trlababalan,> the only team that could beat them on paper. Roma cannot beat Real on paper but it also could not beat Barca on paper.
dx5rvpw,ppc127,It kills me a little inside to say this but I wouldn't underestimate this Liverpool side. They've got zero fucks to give or lose and are comparable to Athleti or Dortmund at their best in recent years. There will be departures this summer and I can't help but think they'll consider the nostalgia of this moment as they throw 110% behind every run.
dx5e3xd,xanot192,Real Madrid players walking around with massive boners atm eyeing 3rd win in a row
dx5djpo,ardothewan,100% agree Barca was the only team I feared. Only fear AM more than them tbh
dx5c4zh,fuckdillyding,Juve got battered at home tho
dx5bm7d,AlgosForCryptos,i want to watch a great game and fair play. otherwise i though Barca would have the best chance to eliminate RM over two games.
dx5cn5w,rinnagz,They are playing away without Dybala
dx5g5nj,Alarie51,Lol
dx5b9nl,DoJu318,I'm a simple man I see Barca lose I upvote
dx5bipk,scarecrowslayer,Ronaldo just won the Ballon D'or.
dx5gj0o,conffra,"You'd be 100% correct, was this not a WC year. Since it is, still three to five heavy contenders."
dx5gpa1,scarecrowslayer,"Since neither Portugal nor Argentina are going to win it, the World Cup can be ignored and Champions League becomes the most important."
dx5h2d7,conffra,"That's not how it always works fella. Remember Cannavaro. Zidane almost did it as well. You win a WC playing mad ball, your odds are good. Neymar, at the very least, is **really** alive in this race."
dx5hkxz,scarecrowslayer,"Ok, Neymar does have a shot, but the World Cup meant nothing in 2010 and nothing in 2014 due to Messi and Ronaldo being the cash cows that they are (not that they weren't the best players), so a Cannavaro is much less likely than a Sneijder, Xavi, or Neuer if anyone other than Brazil win."
dx5bdtu,EnergetikNA,the threepeat is gonna happen isn't it lol
dx5c53d,nixzorr,Bayern save us please.

dx5bkuu,Shwily,"Ballon D'Or is gonna go to Ronaldo again after he was ""finished"""
dx5e7tm,-MCMIV,I fucking hope he wins it. Imagine this subs reaction if Ronaldo has more Ballon d‘Ors than Messi. You would probably read that that award is useless and that nobody cares about it more often than any other comment ever.
dx5c653,EnergetikNA,lol Real playing well and winning a trophy = Ronaldo winning balon d'or. Nice. What a great and prestigious award.
dx5cbcq,Al_Mondega,"Ronaldo is carrying RM through the CL, like he did last season."

dx5bxuk,Dr_Rosen,Bayern look really good. I'm jumping on the Roma train.
dx5c2o7,AlgosForCryptos,all the teams are great. it will be a joy to watch them. i just though that Barca was somewhat RM's kryptonite :)
dx5cvhs,titooo7,So people still didn't learn that being the favourite means shit..
dx5bnad,spareMe-please,I wish what you have said come true.
dx5cotq,Haqadessa,"Man, football can be so shit sometimes. Real Madrid winning the CL is literally the worst of any club winning it, and now they're going to win it again. The universe truly is cruel."
dx5cs6z,AlgosForCryptos,"i just wanna see fair play and goals. also, preferably that the better team wins."
dx5beyc,Rudi_Reifenstecher,imagine leaving dembele on the bench for 85 minutes when your opponent has to score goals and you only need one to see the tie through
dx5c0ff,reda_tamtam,Valverde was atrocious
dx5ccsc,doodlediego,Pique umtitit and semedo were atrocious
dx5cggj,reda_tamtam,"Exactly, it's his job to fix that. Also the pressure they got was huge. Why the he'll didn't he sub in an attacker of someone that can hold the ball, hell Paulinho would have been perfect."

dx5fy64,18Zuck,Goals when the teams are losing in the CL:Ronaldo 22 Messi 4

dx5eqdc,saiko124,Can I just ask a simple question? Where has the GOAT been in the last 3 quarterfinals?
dx5fczp,-WhiteBear,You lot clearly have a much better squad. It's not even a fair comparison. The fact that he's single-handedly winning the league for Barcelona in what was supposed to be the start of Madrid's domination in Spain is one of the reasons why he is considered the GOAT.
dx5h3gp,saiko124,"This has nothing to do with Real Madrid. I'm just asking for a guy that is considered a GOAT, he seems to disappear in awfully a lot of big games, whether that be in the champions league or international tournaments. Its just funny when Barca win Messi gets all the praise and when they lose its never Messi's responsibility."
dx5xggq,Philostotle,How the fuck is blowing a 4-1 lead Messi's responsibility? FFS you Madridiots are something else
dx644be,NjFERXZZ,"not scoring or assisting a single goal in 180 mins against roma in qf of ucl ??? and above that a below average performance. he's no different than the other 10 barca players today and their coach, in fact the only one who should not be criticized is ter stegen."
dx6ocfy,Philostotle,"Messi was heavily involved in the buildup to 3/4 goals in the first leg. If you watched the match you would know he spends a lot of time in the middle of the field to make something happen because no one else does shit. This is contrary to Ronaldo is lives in the box. But hey, why have a nuanced view when you can just suck Ronaldo's Dick all day long?"
dx5xhoq,Philostotle,LOL at the fact that you're getting downvoted. Fucking madridiot roaches have come out of the closet.

dx5cxpc,Philostotle,"dont bother, thr trolls who didnt watch the game will pin Barca blowing a 4-1 lead on Messi"
dx5iuiu,comehonorphaze,Now you know how we felt in the beginning of the season. Ronaldo played great and everyone went on about how hes done because he wasnt scoring. Messi is a beast no doubt. But it just looks like the tables are reversed.
dx5we58,BillionExtermination,"I'm sorry but Ronaldo didn't play great. 2% conversion rate is hardly great. I'm not even saying messi played great, he isn't at fault though"
dx5encx,AdamNJH,"with a team set-up like that, what do you expect him to do. He does not get fed the service like ronaldo does. He practically has to create his own goal scoring opportunities every game,"
dx5hqea,Chuuni_,"Ehh, idgaf, Messi seemed pretty content winning 4 Golden Balls in a row when Barca had a better team than us from around 09-12. If he got all the praise then, he has to take the criticism now.Ronaldo was criticized by Barca fans during that time a lot but he has an elite mentality, and now that our team is better, it's showing."
dx5eqnm,rod333,"To our r/all friends:Barcelona was having a great season. They haven't lost a single game in La Liga \(the Spanish league\) and they were playing the Champion's League, which pits the best teams in Europe against each other.In the Champion's League, you play two games: one at home and one visiting. In the first game, Barcelona handily beat Roma 4\-1.In this second game, Roma won 3\-0. This puts the overall score at 4\-4, which tied the teams. The tiebreaker is the most away\-game goals \(since it's harder\). Since Roma got that one goal in the other game, they beat Barcelona.No one expected this. It's kind of like the Patriots having a perfect season in 2007 then losing to the Giants in the Superbowl. Except, imagine if they lost in the quarterfinals to like, the 2007 Jaguars or something and the Jaguars came back from a three touchdown deficit in the second half. And if NFL teams played four times as many games, so perfect seasons were even rarer.**tl;dr \- HOLY FUCKING SHIT**Edit: Also, Barcelona had a similar comeback last year against PSG, making up a 4 goal deficit by beating them 6\-1. So this is extra schadenfraude for all the Barca haters out there :\)Edit 2: Barcelona is 24\-7\-0 in La Liga. They have 7 games left, so they can still lose the perfect season. Regardless, they won't set the win record \(32\), but they might still not lose.Edit 3: Removing language on them being a tournament favorite :\)"
dx5hoc0,Luiz-Fro,How are they tournament favourites by far ahahaha
dx5iuyb,rod333,Fair point :\)

The American sports commentators they do not know rules very much either and I suspect they make up much false talk and we can not tell differences. The only time I knew they lie to me was when they said this year Barca blew a 4-1 lead in the Quarter Finals. I laugh, no team would bring that much shame on their home."

dx5btjc,ajxdgaming,Barca is just a shit PSG
dx5cr59,-WhiteBear,Valverde doing a full Mourinho away from home.
dx5d0rz,realityfilter,"I honestly can't stand Valverde. He's neutered this team and gotten away with it because of how good Messi has been throughout the season. The lineup today was terrible, waited 81 minutes to bring on a sub - and seriously, what was the point in spending all that money on Dembele to leave him on the bench for 85 minutes in the biggest match of the season?"
dx5dij5,-WhiteBear,"Valverde has won the league with the most average Barcelona squad in years. Although Messi has been in GOD mode throughout the season, some of the credit must surely go to EV. Umtiti and Pique have improved so much. You guys should trust him for at least another season.Pretty sure all the Barca fans would've taken a double after the Super Copa."
dx5ecl9,realityfilter,"Credit is due, for sure. But a lot of the team's results have been a bit fortunate, especially as of late. In August a lot of people were very much doom and gloom, but as the season's progressed, expectations amongst supporters have changed a great deal. Defensively the team has been exceptional, but there have been massive stretches where the attack has been almost non-existent, especially in matches where Messi is unavailable, or just not playing to his abilities. Then you've got today, where the team comes out and plays like a scared, small club. It's only one game, but it's the only game that matters. CL matches are where judgement is passed, and I can't picture many Barcelona teams coming out like the one that played today - conceding a lazy goal almost immediately like they did today, especially without immediately answering back."
dx5iiik,stevefingmadden,He's fucking invincible in the league and yet apparently he's neutered the team
dx5cxrb,ceaguila84,"with fucking Barcelona, unbelievable, jesus christ"
dx5jlnd,dearpisa,"Eusebio Di Francesco deserves more credits than you guys are giving here.This season is his first with Roma. Before Roma he managed Virtus Lanciano, Pescara, Lecce and Sassuolo. UCL semi-final? Check.Biggest game of the season, having nothing to lose, he played a system that is literally never used for the whole season at Roma. Roma is basically a copycat of Barcelona (lol) under Enrique: always a front three, either 4-3-3 or 3-4-3The three star players of the game, based on xG chain are respectively a Tottenham Hotspur reject (Fazio), a 35-year-old lad who is close to retirement and a Manchester City reject (Dzeko).Roma somehow dominated Barca for the whole 90 minutes, giving them two free own goals in the first leg and still got through.Really, some balls right there."

dx5el0s,thebreye,"We were outplayed vs Chelsea in the first leg of CL Rd of 16. We were outplayed in BOTH legs of the quarterfinals vs Roma and were frankly lucky to even have a lead going into today. Messi didn't show up to either leg against Roma. He deserves to be criticized. For whatever reason the quarterfinals seem to be his and Barca's kryptonite. That's 3 straight quarterfinals exits and 4 in 5 years. Roma deserved it. They were by far the better team. Maybe this will wake us up for next years CL but for now, us Barca fans will have to sit back and watch Real Madrid win a 3rd straight CL and Ronaldo win a 6th balon d'or unless Messi turns up for the World Cup."

Well, Ronaldo's gonna keep scoring in CL and has a good shot at yet *another* final in the most important club competition so.... sorry about that treble/unbeaten streak.(Each downvote I will count as an angry FCB fan, so please, rack it up. Words cannot describe the joy your pain brings me 🥂)"
dx5cs5y,claptunes,What if I told you (Morpheus meme)Real > BarcaButMessi > Cristiano
dx5dlgc,Osceana,"I'm already having this conversation in another thread lol. I'd ask what your criteria for that assessment is. If it's a personal opinion, cool. Fair dues! If you want to convince me Messi is objectively better, you need to have quantifiable evidence, that's how objective comparison works.That said, I'd actually reverse the two. No way Real has been better than FCB over the past decade."
dx5e1vx,claptunes,"Regarding RM > Barca, I mean mostly as a team for the past 2 years. The midfield of Kroos Casemiro and Modric is so good its unfair, and you got super subs like Asensio and Lucas VazquezMy criteria for Messi > Cristiano might not be 100% objective, but its because Messi is a playmaker while Cristiano is a poacher. Cristiano is the best poacher to ever play the beautiful game I will give you that, but he relies on your other great players (Asensio, Marcelo is a beast, even Kovacic) while Messi creates more and in my opinion takes the Barca team to another level"
dx5epva,Osceana,"I don't totally agree with you, but I think you got some good points that actually sound rational. I mostly don't agree with Ronaldo being a poacher (more particularly earlier in his game, but now he *has* evolved a bit, and is more of a poacher, but I wouldn't call him one outright). I think Messi relies on his team a lot, but certainly creates a lot, but Ronaldo does as well given the amount of assists he creates (all-time in CL). That area of his game has really developed more in the recent years. So I'll split the difference with you."
dx6hfob,claptunes,"I really admire how Cristiano was able to as you said evolve his game as he aged. Shows that it takes a lot of intelligence to be a top notch footballer. Messi should start to do the same in a sort of opposite fashion, lying deeper.Truth is the day either of them retires will be a sad day for fans of the sport."

dx5eli1,mpinzon93,"Valverde did a shit job this game, but it wasn't just his fault. The defense was bad, Iniesta was a liability even after being rested a lot lately, Sergi was terrible, and Suarez is declining back to his beginning of the season form. Valverde was nonexistant and such late subs were just useless, we needed Dembele way earlier. I feel like Barca got way too cocky with the lead, and not losing a game this season and I really hope this is a big slap in the face for this team and Valverde. Can't just blindly rely on Messi saving games every single time in the attack. I can even understand playing defensive witht he 4-1 lead, but as soon as the team shows the defence isn't in form, EV should have changed the game plan to our normal style.IDK, i'm livid but I hope this is a wake up call and at least Barca can win the double now that the league is basically wrapped up and only the CDR final is left. Maybe next season with Coutinho and Arthur it'll be better, and maybe with an EV that hopefully learns from his mistakes."
dx5ozor,opacino,"> I feel like Barca got way too cocky with the lead, and not losing a game this seasonPut yourself in their shoes. How would you approach a game if you haven't lost at all, not even 1 game in 1 year and you have a 3 goal advantage AND messi"
dx5py0j,mpinzon93,"I mean sure, but I expect them to wake up after a while and start playing half decent at some point in the game. I've been arguing this too, Barca has had visible weaknesses all season but they've never been punished for them so the team has had no reason to really work through them. I really hope this is a big slap In the face that this team is not perfect and needs work."
dx5f8cq,tonymontana96,"I cannot imagine a first division team containing some of the best players of all time playing like they are out taking a stroll in te park walking their dog, where is the passion? as a Barcelona fan it pains me to say that this is why Real Madrid have won it 12 times, because they would give their blood, sweat and tears till the last second."
dx5fi57,Ascz,"Roma manager Eusebio Di Francesco proudly waited outside the home loker room after the final whistle to give Daniele De Rossi and the players on his victorious new-look team an appreciative fist pound on Tuesday night. Injured forward Diego Perotti yelled out, ""There you go! There you go."". Winger El Shaarawy gave a look of pleasant surprise. Defender Manolas yelled out, ""We got a squadra del porco dio, ora"". And before Dzeko hit the locker room door, former Serie A great Francesco Totti hugged him and said, ""Y'all look so different""."

dx5h3x5,ceaguila84,of stfu. He's won 4 CL with him being decisive in all of them with the last one being in 2015.It's true that Madrid has been better the last 4 years but this is a cycle. He has nothing to prove. They are both incredible
dx5hcsi,LeChadAussie,"Decisive in all of them? Can tell you have been a fan since 2010. He didn't play in the first Ucl final so how can he be decisive in that? He did not play in that final, get your facts straight. In the finals stage of the Ucl Messi has a shocking goal to game ratio when compared to the group stage. Ronaldo has a better record in the knockout stage than group stage. It's about when and who you score against that counts."
dx5h2yd,familyguyisbae,"Thank god for this season. Our lose to Bayern is being covered up, our bad CL performance is being covered up, our drop to the EL is being covered up. Our bad EL performance is being covered up. This is the best season for a team to be garbage."

dx5xcfu,ceaguila84,"I don't want to see this goddamn 4-4-2 anymore. We need our DNA back, I still can't believe we didn't react and tried to held a 4-1 lead.Several things are clear: We need someone on midfield who can create and let Messi go back to being a false 9. Coutinho needs to move to midfield, if not we're going to be severely exposed when Iniesta leaves. oh and hire GriezmannRoma played with heart and conviction, congrats."

dx5ci5m,Jace279,I'm still in Disbelief Valverde really messed up formation wise this Semedo was pretty much invisible and Roberto didn't have the pace to play in the wing. I just hope that this doesn't translate into the league game this Saturday. I can only hope we can still claim both the league title and domestic cup. Only silver lining would be if Juve can pull a comeback against Madrid Tomorrow.

dx5bfee,Eglaerinion,Sigh.
dx5we9f,ArsenLOL,"not even sure why this is controversial. Messi´s barcelona has chocked in the last 3 years in champions, ronaldo won 2 lol. Messi has had 4 goals scored in champions when the team is losing, ronaldo has had 22 when his team is losing. Cristiano is a leader and a strong athletic footballer with no match. Messi is a shy player with a lot of talent but he doesnt have the balls in the big matches and that is why ronaldo will always be considered the best in history no matter what messi fangirls think. Also lets not forget this isnt a controversial opinion. Cristiano has been named the best footballer aka ballon d or for the last 4 out of 5 times. Only in reddit this season messi is the ""Goat"" because he scores against noname teams in unimportant matches. Sad but true, hopefully argentina can carry messi in the worldcup so his career doesnt end in this embarrasement."

Giving Barcelona an absolute shoeing at home to reach the semi-finals is brilliant, and it was a dominant performance too. Barcelona looked clueless in the second half, they barely did anything after Roma got their third. The atmosphere was superb too. Amazing performance by Roma, fantastic result for Italian football and I hope we get them in the semi-finals..."

Manolas and DDR both made up for their own goals today. I'm so proud of the whole team. To all the salty Barca fans who said the own goals weren't luck, enjoy watching the CL as a neutral.

dx5bkjo,Ursus-shock,"Can someone explain to me the difference between Mourinho and Valverde ? except the obvious difference in the level of the players ? Because i think that if you put Mourinho at Barca he does the same thing. Put 2 good defending and quick players on the wings, solid midfield and have Messi Suarez be free. I don't get his tactics ? Against a block like this you don't sub in Dembele before? The guy can run the lane and make openings like he did everytime he played"

Valverde should bear most of the blame, 442 with Roberto as RW did not work well in the first leg, Barca was truly lucky with 2 own goals. With Roma defending compactly Barca needed speed on the flanks. Dembele should have started or subbed in way earlier. Suarez has been off form for a while now, makes sense why Barca is looking to sign Griezmann. Hell, stick Messi back in the false 9 role like earlier in the season."

dx5cahj,AnnieIWillKnow,"Vastly different manners of exit in the end - Barcelona had a comfortable lead and outrageously blew it, whereas Man City were blown away in the first leg - but both City and Barcelona represent teams who have absolutely dominated domestically, and both essentially had their leagues wrapped up for months... and now come to struggle in the latter stages of the Champions League.It was something noted about Pep's Bayern teams that as they were so comfortable domestically, they struggled to be able to raise their game and bring their absolute very best for the crunch games in the Champions League - because they weren't in a situation where they were having to be their absolute best every game they played, so lost an edge. I wonder if this is part of what has happened to Barcelona and Man City, too."

dx5e7kw,MattyBTraps42069,"Congrats to Roma first off.Take nothing away from the Roma players, they were fantastic from the start. Too many big names for Barça played absolutely shit. Pique played like absolute piss. Umtiti, as much as I love him, is a big factor in the loss. He completely gave up on the first goal, he could have prevented it. Pique and Umtiti played absolutely woeful, along with semedo. The entire midfield lacked any kind of creativity. There were no good passes strung together, and no type of good incisive runs to be seen at all. Suarez was invisible, we would have been better off playing paco if you ask me. Messi had an off game, which he will be unfairly slammed for, considering he brought the team this far on his own. Alba wasn't so bad, however his distribution was obviously bad. The only time in the entire match that I can say we even played decent was in the end when we were trying to push for the win. Even that was obviously nowhere near good enough.That brings me to this final point. Valverde. Why? Just why? The home leg against Roma was not a good performance, just a good result, and he plays the exact same team. He plays Sergi at RB the entire season, and in the UCL quarter finals, decided to experiment with him at RM. I know he's a natural midfielder, but out wide is not where he needs to be in the mid. Down by one, not so bad. Down two, obviously a bad situation, should make a sub. Down three? Changes need to be made. However, he waited until the 85th minute to make the second and third changes. Dembele should have STARTED, or at the very least should have come on far sooner than he did. He should have been an early second half sub. Paco as well, maybe just a bit later in. The persons who came in and out I can't argue with, it was the timing. Roma played excellent. The ref had a good game as well imo, and we played shite. Can't change it, still love the team and all the players we have. Forca Barça."

All I know now is that I hope Liverpool wins. The Egyptian Messi is writing his own story."
dx5f0z3,xTimpi1,"Everyone was just fucking awful, weird team selection, no preparation it seemed like, bad game plan.

dx5bs0j,bugxter,"If you can't score a single goal against Roma away, you deserve to be out.What the fuck, Barcelona."
dx5bvlw,themsuboy,There's a lot of people with a Manchester United flair here making fun of Barca. Its kind of hilarious seeing the season they are having.
dx5cbb4,carrick1363,Hope you know you're not going to win the UCL or your league
dx5ceem,themsuboy,We are going to win our league and the domestic cup. Which is a lot more than Manchester United is going to be able to accomplish.
dx5cljd,carrick1363,Haha. Keep dreaming. Forza Juve.
dx5csd0,themsuboy,What do you mea keep dreaming. We are at the top of the table and will win again.
dx5cxe7,carrick1363,Thought you where a Roma fan. Seems you changed your flair
dx5d40l,themsuboy,You can look at my post history. I have always had the Juventus flair and my posts show it. Try again next time buddy.
dx5bvq9,NeoLies,I love this game
dx5c6rq,aalupatti,"If the aggregate is 4 - 4, then how did Roma Qualify?"
dx5c8n7,buzzballads,Roma had 1 away goal and Barca had 0
dx5c8vh,Spizz96,Roma scored one away goal while Barca scored 0 away goals. If the teams are tied on aggregate score the winner is decided by who scored more away goals.
dx5c8zs,Providon,Cause of the away goal rule
dx5caai,wpreggae,"they lost 4:1 at Barcelona, an away goal gives you an advantage if the score is even after 2 games. If it was 5:5 after a 4:1 and 1:4 games there would be overtime and possibly penalties"
dx5cb2k,eddy1245,Away goal rule
dx5ccku,akaneuer2,They had an away goal that the scored in the first leg. Away goals count as more than one if the scores are even
dx5g12u,aalupatti,Got it.. Thanks

dx5dq7z,HumpinGDucK,So many 12-year olds are crying their eyes out now...
dx5e17e,GumerBaby,The good news is Messi has more time to rest now.
dx5euqc,ketzal7,"Be warned, the Messi haters are out in full force."
dx5f32r,fredbogho,Hes an all time great. But GOAT claims are completely delusonial.
dx5luae,darthvader7888,He's the GOAT. Not his fault his coach and team are shit.
dx5nw27,fredbogho,"Everytime he fails, its his team fault? We didnt even see him on the pitch today. He was god awful."
dx649q9,darthvader7888,He basically has to play CM because of our god awful midfield. Put a half decent midfield behind him and... well I think you know the rest. Guarantee you Ronaldo would be doing much worse playing for this Barca.
dx5oipr,ketzal7,It's not “his” team. He shouldn't be solely responsible everytime barca doesn't get a result.
dx5fc1b,RonaldoNeur28,Haha fuck off mate. Messi is the GOAT.
dx5fpnt,fredbogho,Maradona and Pelé are miles ahead
dx5eyd3,VegasFTW,Barcelona pulled an Argentina. Fully dependent on Messi.
dx5f1qq,fredbogho,And Messi pulled a Messi from Argentina NT. Completely irrelevant.
dx5f4j6,VegasFTW,Truer words could not be said
dx5fit9,Fcasillas11,Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich is the final we all want to see
dx5fkzv,rockbottom11,So madrid can tear apart Bayern like they always do? Madrid is Bayern's kryptonite.
dx5l277,hypn0t1zed,wasn't long ago when Bayern was considered Madrid's kryptonite
dx5hmj6,Luiz-Fro,Exaggerating much? It's been Real 2-1 Bayern in the last 6 years
dx5fxlu,Fcasillas11,Didn't Bayern beat Madrid like 4 years ago?
dx5hn1f,bastianism,if madrid wins the ucl I will neck myself

dx5b4k9,JokeercL,Lads...
dx5b95s,lonelyzombi3,...its Barcelona
dx5b6di,Bighairman,PumtitiMarc Andre “better than De Gea” Ter Stegen
dx5bd2r,DJSkrillex,Ter Stegen played well imo.
dx5c0as,Bighairman,I'm just meming bro. Saw 3 goals and decided to take the piss.
dx5dn9e,JJaysNotHome,"""meming"". That's just awful."
dx5dq91,Bighairman,I also wanted to calm the hype around Ter Stegen and Umtiti. Comparing TS to DDG is just farcical really.
dx5e36y,gccrp,No it's not. Have you even watched Barça frequently this season?
dx5e661,Bighairman,I have - he's great with the ball at his feet and a good shot stopper but not as great a shot stopper at De Gea. It depends what metric you use really. We also have a bad experience with ex Barca keepers in the PL - see Bravo and Valdes. Maybe time to exit the Barca keeper hype?
dx5el4n,gccrp,"I don't see how Bravo's or Valdes' perfomances are relevant at all to this discussion tbh. And as you said, it depends on the metric. A goalkeeper can be so much more for his team than a shot stopper, and MAtS has been combining great goalkeeping abilities along with also great footwork to help Barca sustain their possession football. You're entitled to your opinion on the matter for sure, as am i, but saying comparing the two of them is farcical is just wrong. Btw i do agree that DDG is the better one out of the two."
dx5ewoz,Bighairman,"I'm saying Barcelona keepers tend to get a bit overhyped, like Ter Stegen. I've watched him a few times and never been convinced really. But yes I agree with you that the system is important, maybe farcical is a strong word but I believe De Gea is the better player."
dx5fhq7,gccrp,"Very understandable opinion, especially considering he's been United's best player for at least 2 seasons now lol. He really is amazing and imo the best keeper in the world right now."
dx5bi2g,super_caramel_bear,I need a reason to root for Roma and Liverpool in the Semis..... SAME COLOR AS MAN UNITED LETS GOOOOO.please no Sevilla please
dx6egb4,internethjaelten,Fuck off
dx5bhbm,Newklearish,"This is fucking embarrassing. Both legs have been a showcase of mediocrity, and at the end it's been decided when a single man decided to play football. Fuck Mourinho and his petty, miserable, boring-ass approach to this game."

Valverde made the biggest fucking rookie mistake by defending the whole fucking game. We did exactly what PSG did last year and look what happened. What a pathetic performance and that goes for all the players including Messi. Congrats to Roma, you guys attacked right from the first minute and got the results."

dx5bab8,lordtnt,4th place Seria A team defeat 1st place Spanish team.Italy win WC 2018 confirmed.
dx5bgt0,Into_Intoxication,Sensational upset but no fan except Roma fans are really looking forward to the likes of Dzeko in the semi's.
dx5bmln,Skadrys,"Fuck Valverde. Seriously, players are exhausted, he doesn't rotate and plays best squad in every match. Rakitić played almost every match this season. Why the fuck we have 24 man squad and play 15 players.His attack has been shit whole season and only being carried by Messi. He thinks he's at Bilbao still.I've been saying this since 2 months into season. Not coach for such a club."
dx5btd6,GloryKnight,The fact that Fazio finished this game is beyond me. The first Hit on messi was a very Red yellow Card. The second Hit on iniesta should have been after He got warned during that free kick. And wtf was that penalty? Dzeko is starting with grabbing on Piqué and pushing him back all the way through the Box. How in the World can u give a penalty for that.
dx5cgjk,Majukun,"the guy who hit messi hard was not fazio if i remember correctly.also,that was a clear penalty"
dx5ct7m,GloryKnight,Fazio hit messi in the first half. Then He got warned during that free kick near the end. In the second half He Hit iniesta.
dx5i5oo,Belgian_Wafflez,"It was a blatant penalty. Pique holds his arm the whole time, then throws himself over while holding his arm to pull him down, while also trying to make a tackle which trips up Dzeko without touching the ball.I watched it with three other non-partisan football fans and we all thought it was a penalty."
dx6awu6,GloryKnight,So its ok to push off a defender as a attacker with his arm? I dont even know. And whats your point on the two players that should have sent off? Fazio and Jesus?
dx5ca94,Romaniack,"With all due respect to Roma,this game was lost by Barcelona,and second won by the romans.If EV woudnt play defensive game(what was he thinking,Cruyff would roll in his grave for not playing attacking football)maybe there woudnt be any remontada.2 DM(Busi and Raki),Iniesta and Roberto as wings.No change for 75 minutes.Your 150 M dollars fast player who can go on counter attack introduced only in the 85 min.Fucking shame!Anyway,congratz,lads!"
dx5dtey,Nilley123,I really wish soccer in general would clean up all this flopping by far the worse thing about the sport.. I think i saw Florenzi Suarez and Dzeko get sniped by a sniper few times
dx5dwzb,redytosell,Suarez should teach acting
dx5e2ad,Nilley123,not really hes fucking horrible at same with just about every player.. just makes the game so fucking shitty to watch.. Him and Dzeko some of the biggest men out their and they fall on the field everyother attack
dx5evfb,anonymous-658,After the penalty there was a tackle on Iniesta that 100% should have been a yellow and would have been 2nd yellow/red for whoever made the challenge (can't remember which player). That no-call and the timing in the game was really bad for Barca's mood. Really should have been called.
dx5ftzw,Xamtor,All Roma needed was Totti to retire.
dx5ru8z,Y3llowflash1,"People acting surprised, i knew roma were gonna win as soon as dzeko got that away goal, c'mon people it was there strategy all along, they even did it against shaktar, by losing 2 -1 away from home but winning on away goals. like today, they lost away from home, but won on way goals"
dx5b8k0,delta_77,I guess we'll win it again boys
dx5buah,UwotM895,"Ronaldo gets another undeserved ballon d'or now if he's gets a few tap ins against juve. absolutely fucking disgusting how idiots will use this as justification against messi even though it's his shit team and manager that lost, sick of the luck in this sport"
