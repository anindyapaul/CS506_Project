As long as US consumers have an appetite for cheap shit from China and there's profits to be made selling cheap shit from China in the US, it's going to be very difficult to prohibit it effectively."

dwsvsnx,StewofPuppies,Yeah this is what we do at home. Found out a lot of our friends and families buy peeled garlic. Can't imagine why. Firstly it's easy to grow on your own. ANd second the ones you shuck yourself are like 10x better in quality than the ones you get peeled usually.
dwt7x4d,audscias,"Never mind me, I'm just finding out that people actually does use dry peeled garlic for cooking.

If tou still feel that peeling it is a chore just get one of [these](https://www.amazon.com/Ginsco-Silicone-Garlic-Peeler-Kitchen/dp/B01MCRAH5S/ref=sr_1_6?s=home-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1522870777&sr=1-6&keywords=garlic+peeler), you get a perfectly peeled clove in a few seconds."

Then, once they die, you can probably use the rest of the organs and replace him with another prisoner who just made it into general population because of your massive *anti-corruption* drive. Am I doing it right?Then all your former enemies who had the will or means to oppose you are either dead with their organs sold off, or getting there and making you money by shelling garlic. Then you could do something like proclaim yourself ruler for life, no one will oppose you, and in fact, Donald Trump will call and congratulate you.Isn't it great that the US is doing wildly crazy things like standing up for human rights around the world? People can say what they like about past US presidents. I don't recall a PRC leader becoming dictator for life, especially since the west normalized relations with China in 79. It's almost as if Xi Jingping knew that US leadership is incredibly unqualified, ignorant, and powerless, and as such, knew it would be a great opportunity to pull something like this, or else he may have needed to wait 10 years until the next communist party convention."

dwsr9yq,InformationHorder,"Not sure why the down votes, he's right. Honey bees are pretty safe due to the preponderance of industrial agricultural beekeepers who can raise new queens and hives. Now, they sure don't have it *easy*, and are having a helluva time between mites, pesticides, and colony collapse disorder, but it's the native pollinators and wild bees like mason and bumble bees that are getting clobbered, but have no humans who manage their colonies and populations. When a honey bee colony dies it gets replaced with a new split off a stronger hive undergoing a swarm, but if all the wild pollinators die off in an area due to neonictoids...ain't no one bringing in new ones...Source: r/beekeeping"

dwszr1e,InformationHorder,Thanks :) I drive information where it needs to go.
dwsmlba,tried_it_liked_it,According to who? Because I have heard only strongly researched and documented points that would indicate the opposite?
dwsw614,StewofPuppies,"This is because of mis-representation of information in news articles. Specific bee species might be endangered and their numbers ARE dwindling. However, honey bees (average bees you see assuming you live in the same place I live in) are doing perfectly fine. Well... FINE is overstating it. THey're doing OK. Obviously due to climate change, some parts of the world will be affected which will affect these bees. Pesticide use and other chemical treatments as well.The endangered bees in particular started showing up again around my house which means the endanger label is likely largely regional depending on how accommodating the climate is to these bees.A huge portion of sensationalism that convinced people ""all bees"" are endangered is just that; sensationalism. And while you can say what you like about such sketchy methods, it did serve its purpose. Most people around the world care about bees now whereas when I was a kid growing up, most people hated bees"
dwtcjgz,tried_it_liked_it,"Alright . That actually explained quite a lot. I remember hitting bees with flat sticks when i was a youth. Seems like a fucked up game now. Like hunting Dodo birds I'm glad the honeyboys are doing better. If its all the same though, I will continue to let the idea sit that they are in danger. Seems to be benefiting the species to at least some extent. Fear of loss is a powerful tool . One more question? How are the wasps and yellow-jackets doing? Do they have any type of culling event like bees or are most wasps left to their own because they have little to offer the human race as far as raw product is concerned"
dwtdcsf,StewofPuppies,"I think wasps are doing OK generally. Wasps actually attribute to killing off honeybees. I would say kill off all wasps you find but imagine if we go so far in this road in 10 years time some news article comes out saying people who put a witch hunt on wasps ruined the environment.AFAIK, wasps are huge assholes and mainly kill off other life forms it competes food/territory with. IMO wasps are literally the stuff of nightmare they base alien horror movies off of. Even when bees were hated, the consensus was that ""DON'T MOVE OR BOTHER IT! IT WILL LEAVE YOU ALONE!"" Wasps on the other hand was always ""Fuck wasps, kill it."" Honey really is liquid gold. The reason why China's fake honey industry is bullshit is because honey has antibacterial properties in them. I'm not sure if fructose corn syrup does."
dwtducr,tried_it_liked_it,I think every other species on earth thinks we are wasps. Since we are assholes who kill of other life forms for almost no reason at all we are the stuff of nightmares.....we are the wingless wasps
dwtemib,StewofPuppies,"Don't be so sure this is a human exclusive characteristic. What you are describing modern people label as ""modern parasites of nature."" Primarily the focus has mainly centered on people but more and more observation with highly social animals/predators like orca or chimpanzees show this same destructive and almost 'evil' characteristic to ring true in ANY intelligent life form.In fact they actually DID observe a warrior tribe of chimpanzees that hunted, killed, decapitated/mutilated, and cannibalized on neighboring territory monkeys. They waged war and basically literally use a very primitive and almost indigenous strategy of warfare where formations/spacing/intervals are used. They expand territory and will cannibalize on other monkeys like monsters but when the fighting is over, they immediately turn into amicable/lovely chimps to each other.Dolphins, humpbacks, etc also kill/rape brutally.When we look at these animals, who seemingly possess the same morally corrupt violence we humans share, it's becoming clear that this isn't exclusively a human trait. It is a trait of intelligent life. Morality and ethics is a human made concept. Without human kind, rules of Darwinism and laws of survival of the fittest would be the absolute law we obey. Meaning killing off competition's offsprings so your offspring will thrive is not out of the question.We excuse animals because we developed moral code and accepted them while animals might not grasp that kind of concept. But it seems certain animals that are highly sociable and apex predators are not all that different from us. Period. These warrior group of chimpanzees literally reflected what indigenous war-mongering tribe would look like.Anyways I just thought this was interesting read. Maybe you might disagree. It kind of shows that human beings aren't this evil parasitic thing; this is actually just how survival of the fittest is and we see this evident in many other examples. None just has evolved as highly as humans have. But if given the chance, I believe other species of animals might one day get there and even wage war/despicable things that we shake our heads to... because again. Morality/ethics is a man made concept. If we never evolved to this level of intelligence, the concept of rape or murder being wrong wouldn't even exist. Ofc none of this excuses or justifies committing those acts either."
dwsr3tg,bizaromo,"For one, [Dennis Van Englesdorp](https://www.vanengelsdorpbeelab.com/faq.html), an etymologist who studies CCD (colony collapse disorder) and runs the annual US honeybee colony loss counts.> **Are honey bees endangered? Are they going extinct?**> In short: no. The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a species of bee that was introduced to the United Stated by European colonists in the 1600's for honey. The honey bee is the species of bee that beekeepers manage for honey and crop pollination in both Europe and North America; their population is large and worldwide. Because we depend so heavily on the pollination services provided by honey bees, their health status and colony numbers are intensively monitored by researchers. This monitoring effort provides information about honey bee colonies in the United States over many years, allowing trends to be easily visualized. This monitoring effort has allowed to visualize the recent honey bee health crisis; rates of colony losses have been high in recent years and heavy losses place enormous financial strain on beekeepers. But, the overall number of honey bee colonies in North America has been relatively stable over the last two decades because beekeepers have been able to replace their losses by splitting colonies and installing new packages of honey bees. In conclusion, yes, honey bee colonies are dying every year, but because beekeepers can anticipate and replace those losses, the total number of honey bee colonies in the United States is currently stable. So, why then, are there news articles talking about bees being endangered?> What most people don't know is that there are many thousands of wild, native bee species world-wide. In North America it has been estimated that there are about 4,000 species of native bees and the state of Maryland alone is home to more than 430 species of native bees. These native bees include things like bumble bees, carpenter bees, leaf cutter and mason bees, sweat bees, miner bees, and digger bees. These native bees are also important pollinators, and contribute valuable pollination to both crops and many wild flower species. However, most of these pollinators have not been monitored closely like honey bees are and recently, scientists have realized that some of these bee species are facing similar issues to honey bees. For example, the rusty-patched bumble bee (Bombus affinis), one of the 46 species of bumble bee found in North America, used to be a common species, found throughout the Northeastern United States. The rusty-patched bumble bee declined rapidly in 1996 and since then has rarely been seen anywhere in its former range. Because of this population decline, scientists have proposed putting this species on the Endangered species list. > Because there are so many bees in North America and most people are broadly unfamiliar with them, the word “bee” is used loosely and can be used for honey bees at times and other for native bees. Which can be confusing and potentially alarming when “bee” is followed by phrases like: “endangered” or “going extinct.” Before panicking, it is important to look at which species of bee the article is talking about. **Honey bees are not currently close to being endangered and therefore are not close to becoming extinct but this is not true for all native bee species.**"
dwszpvf,threebellies,"Honey bees are being wiped out and experiencing colony collapse in places like North America, and are being pushed out in some cases by the more aggressive Africanized honey bees. If the pollinators collapse in a agriculturally important area, oh let's say the Central California valley. Such an event would send shockwaves through food markets, and suddenly apples and oranges are 10 dollarydoos a piece and it may take years to re-establish pollinators in that area artificially.Sitting around claiming we shouldn't be concerned about the collapse of bee populations in North America is ridiculous. That's exactly what you're implying here with splitting hairs to claim they are not at risk of extinction because there's lots of them worldwide.It's called *extirpation* of a species; and it has huge impacts for any of the ecological settings involved, troll."

The rusty-patched bumble bee declined rapidly in 1996 and since then has rarely been seen anywhere in its former range. Because of this population decline, scientists have proposed putting this species on the Endangered species list.> Because there are so many bees in North America and most people are broadly unfamiliar with them, the word “bee” is used loosely and can be used for honey bees at times and other for native bees. Which can be confusing and potentially alarming when “bee” is followed by phrases like: “endangered” or “going extinct.” Before panicking, it is important to look at which species of bee the article is talking about. **Honey bees are not currently close to being endangered and therefore are not close to becoming extinct but this is not true for all native bee species.**"

dwss3q6,bizaromo,"There's no need to be so hostile. I am actually better informed than most people on the subject... Some native bee species are endangered and will likely go extinct. *Apis mellifera*, the western honey bee, is not even threatened. Beekeepers have increased their number of colonies to make up for the loss rates that the media freaked out about back in 2007. There is a lot of confusion on the subject. But if you actually read the current science and annual colony counts instead of jumping to conclusions based on media reports, you will see the my claim is supported by the facts."
dwslwxw,FCalleja,"He knows some at least. Honey bees are a domesticated breed of bees, so they're in no real danger of being wiped out just as cows or chickens will never be.But it's also true that honey bees are just a (albeit big) fraction of the pollination we need, and other wild bees and pollinators being slowly wiped out is definitely happening."

dwt7p3k,Florida51,Is it really the Chinese fault? People are broke and barely surviving here so of course they will buy the cheapest products they can . If more people we're more well of and we had a actual middle class alot of these issues wouldn't exist but when so much of the economy lives pay check to pay check of course this will happen . I am fortunate enough to be doing ok and I personally would never buy cheap Chinese honey or other cheap Chinese products but many others simply don't have that choice . They buy what they can afford. Instead if a trade war how about raise the minimum wage. Instead of funding trillions of dollars to the military help companys manufacture in the us . Is it America's fault Chinese people buy high end american products instead of chineses products ?
dwt8d5r,Conjwa,"I can't really argue with anecdotal evidence. Honestly my concern is more with IP theft and government subsidized industries in China which make it impossible for non-Chinese business to compete than I am with honey.Economics tells us that rational actors will still opt for the cheapest products, all things considered. ""By American"" has never really worked.>exist but when so much of the economy lives pay check to pay check of course this will happen Then it's good that GDP growth is up, jobs are up, payrolls are up, and at full employment there is now upward pressure on median wages for the first time in decades.Democratic policies are great for helping those living in extreme poverty, and helping them out by creating a metaphorical safety net, but they don't do much to ensure upward economic mobility, and ensuring people aren't living paycheck to paycheck. People making 40k/year aren't getting extra money or relief to help them into the middle class through democratic policies."

dwsgkp4,BigBennP,"True to an extent, sure. We may be working with different definitions though. 1. Things from China are comparatively cheap. Your $800 iPhone from Foxconn in China May will be $1,600 iPhone if it had to be produced totally in the US. 2. There's different levels of expensive. The industrial stuff that is still produced in the u.s. is things like, heavy construction equipment that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and precision manufacturing robots that cost millions of dollars. Not to mention aircraft that cost millions of dollars."
dwshey4,UncomfortableNews,"I just mentioned it, because there's this mood in these topics that China basically produces cheap crap and floods the market with it.

The example several post up comparing an $800 iphone made in China costing $1600 in the US is a gross exaggeration considering the amount of automation involved. The only real benefit is the amount of subsidizing that China does and the location of suppliers. Having said that, Trek use to make CF bikes in the US and they sold for a reasonable amount of money. What it came down to is counting every penny to maintain market share. There's a lot of competition in the bike industry... so much so that I think it has actually caused bike prices to increase due to lower volumes and overhead costs."

dwslpqz,ShrimpCrackers,Some estimates says it costs the USA more than *a trillion in the past few years in lost revenue* from PRC trade theft. You can find cheap copies of all sorts of American products on Aliexpress. China even creates fake German and American car copies.
dwsp3kh,adityang,"That is similar to those claims made by hollywood and music industry against piracy. China can't sell patent infringed stuff to any western economy. And by the cost of goods if they were made in US, most of the third world countries could buy original stuff either. Infact, cheap chinese knock-offs may help US that more people get exposure to them and some want to buy real ones which they wouldn't have otherwise."
dwsqdu3,ShrimpCrackers,"Looking at AliExpress right now, I've found tons of knockoffs of US tools and other tech. Just saying. What about fidget toys? Tons of them are fake. Yes it does hurt US companies. I'm not talking about piracy of movies and music that people wouldn't have purchased anyway, we're talking about actual hardware that people purchased."
dwsrxrg,adityang,"Well, if companies aren't enforcing their patents in US, we can't say Chinese products are knock-offs. There are many ways to legally circumvent the patents or they might not have been patented/expired. But surely US companies can sue US importers if any one tries to import knock-offs right?"
dwszxo4,ShrimpCrackers,"They are trying to enforce it but the flood is insane. Aliexpress is NOT a US company. They're Chinese. Nike literally can't stop them when they're shipping individually. China is supposed to enforce them but lets be honest, they're not going to.Huawei still copies Cisco routers, even the bugs. GreatWall still copies cars from all over. SQNY still freaking exists and still makes fake batteries. Laibao still sells fake Honda CRV's."
dwt2gn7,adityang,"Then ban Aliexpress. Take it to court. Some one needs to order from US for chinese companies to ship. Just because some one is copying something doesn't mean patent infringement. Most patents last for only 4 years or so.. If it is not being enforced, may be it is not worth being enforced.. or there is nothing to enforce. Reverse engineering is a valid business model. US companies reverse engineer too... it is entirely different thing from IPR theft. As I said before, there is no factual basis for claiming any loss due to IPR theft by china..."

dwt9j20,adityang,"Who is selling ""fake"" honda CRVs in US? No one... ever. And that is the point. You can't claim Honda is losing money due to ""fake"" CRV just because people are buying it. They are only buying it because it costs 1/10th of honda CRV, otherwise they wouldn't have."
dwtmdnp,ShrimpCrackers,"Honda sold CRVs in China. So they were not selling nearly as well since Laibao made a cheap copy. Again, cherry picking and trying to reframe the issue by saying sales to the USA. But they're selling tons of fake US items all over the planet. Fake Nike shoes, fake Fidget spinners, fake phones, fake routers, fake stuff all over. That's a lot of revenue lost of US companies.You really want the US to start banning Aliexpress? Internet censorship? And yes they did take it to court, in China where they can't win because the state always backs its own. China has the most WTO complaints on the planet by a long shot for good reason."
dwu6al5,adityang,"This is just a conjucture that people from Africa would have bought Nike from US if Chinese knock offs were not available. Infact, most knock offs aren't patent infringement but copyright infringement. Entirely different thing.

dwuckmo,ShrimpCrackers,"Not to mention companies like JumpFromPaper and FidgetCube and XD Design's Anti\-Theft bag and Cisco are harmed because China flooded the market with fake clones. Now people associate these with poor quality products because people are more familiar with the fake clones than the real thing which aren't. In each of these instances the companies have actually gotten into some financial trouble because of the fakes. Aside from Cisco, they're not even really expensive products and the fakes are half or more of the price of the real thing. Its that most people don't even know what the real thing is and you can even see that on Reddit where people are making comments about the product that are experiences clearly from the fakes.For JumpFromPaper the actual bags expand, don't have a nasty glue smell, etc. But in every thread pointing them out, everyone talks about the fakes. For Fidgetcubes people talk about the joystick head falling off, while its completely secure on the real thing. The fakes have the joystick cubes fall off all the time. In these instances the fakes are about half or more the price of the real thing so consumers aren't actually saving that much. It's that there are tons of fake companies in China direct shipping in and flooding the internet. They have shell companies designed to close and start new ones at first signs of crackdowns. It's not just the USA market that matters, it's the global market as well. XD Design's bags are selling at a fraction that they could have because the market is flooded with fakes that fall apart."

We were in 2010 when there was still more electronics being made here. We'll get a nice test case with Foxconn's Wisconsin factories but I suspect they'll have a lot of quality issues early on."
dwsqlkc,salesforcewarrior,"I'd argue that if the funding was adequate, the US would produce the most high quality products in the world. It's hard to compete with China because of how little they pay employees, and how few work regulations they have. I'd argue that outsourcing our productions was the first step to our economic downfall overall. We used to design and produce top quality products. Now we just design them. That's strictly because of how expensive it is to manufacture them. It's only expensive because of cheap labor in other countries.In terms of cost, middle class employees require way too much compared to Chinese factory workers. I just don't see how cost isn't the primary factor, if not the sole factor. For your scenario of China having superior quality to be correct, they would have to design their own products instead of stealing designs from other countries. Since they don't design their products though, we can't have a true comparison.However we can look at one factor alone. In America, anything can be accomplished with money. Anything."
dwsu1ny,Jaerba,"I disagree almost completely. I'd argue US manufacturing hasn't been the best in the world since the rest of the world recovered from WWII. That was our advantage. American companies ignored Deming, Japanese companies embraced him and the rest is history. Japan was able to subvert the Quality-Time-Cost triangle and beat us on all 3, way before outsourcing complex goods to China became dominant. China makes for a useful scapegoat but US consumers were already preferring Sony to Phillips for their TVs, and US businesses were already preferring Canon to Xerox for their copiers. In fact, Xerox's business was basically built on mediocre quality and expensive service contracts. Once Canon got up to speed, they crushed Xerox on quality and the service contract business dropped in price. Yes, American companies are significantly better at design than Chinese companies today. But we're talking strictly about manufacturing. Wages for Chinese factory workers has been increasing significantly, which has created their huge middle class who want to buy American goods. Eventually they'll become leaders in Design, which is where the most money is anyways.And this isn't even to mention German manufacturing who, as far as I've read, are the only ones able to consistently keep a high level. US manufacturing stagnated and Japan took the helm. Now Japan is stagnated and Korea will take the helm. And at some point relatively soon, it'll be China's turn."
dwswqi4,salesforcewarrior,"I agree with everything that you said, and it is all correct. However...>Yes, American companies are significantly better at design than Chinese companies today.Designing a product is difficult. Manufacturing a product is not as difficult. Assembling a product is not difficult at all. You're basically saying that the US can master the most difficult part of a manufacturing process, but has trouble with the easier parts of the process. We can design, engineer, and draw a plan for amazing products. According to a lot of people here though, we can't figure out how to put the design together. Somehow China has mastered this, and pays people low wages to perform this work. America however giving people high wages for the same work, would not have the same quality outcome, and would in fact have lower quality. If US companies could pay their employees $1 a day instead of $12 a day, you honestly don't believe that the quality would skyrocket for US manufactured appliances? >China makes for a useful scapegoat but US consumers were already preferring Sony to Phillips for their TVs, and US businesses were already preferring Canon to Xerox for their copiers.Sony and Canon both released their products in the 70's. The US began outsourcing to China in the 70's. Xerox and Phillips manufactured in the US, starting in the late 50's. You don't find it coincidental that Sony and Canon [or any manufacturer for that matter] made good products in the 70's, but not earlier? You don't see a correlation between what Xerox and Phillips paid the American workers, vs what Sony and Canon paid their Asian workers at the time? The idea was invented, and designed in the US. It was eventually made in China, and for the best case scenario we'll assume that they didn't steal the designs. Yet nobody here seems to think that China's low pay wages had any influence on these Chinese companies taking over the market? Someone is going to have to dumb down this explanation, because I'm not getting it. Seriously, if I'm wrong, please explain it to me. The explanations so far are ""It's not only because they pay their workers slave wages, but it's because they do a very good job at it too"". I'm not being sarcastic. I have no idea how you can tell me the history of Sony and Canon, while simultaneously arguing against how Sony and Canon became rich in the first place. They became more powerful than Xerox and Phillips specifically because of how little they paid people. The west engineers products. The east copies the engineering designs, and makes a replacement with cheap labor. This is how the world has worked for the last few decades, and how it works currently. Once the west dropped out of the manufacturing market, China lowered the bar. Yet people are saying that China is the bar setter. I am clueless apparently."
dwsycrw,Jaerba,"Design and manufacturing and fundamentally different tasks, that require different cultures and mindsets. Dividing them into easy and hard is wrong.No, Canon and Sony crushed the best of Xerox and Phillips in defective parts per million (one of the primary quality standards) and it is almost entirely because of Japan's quality revolution - TQM, etc. The products from Xerox and Phillips' heyday were the best at their time and satisfied the customer at the time. Then Japan adopted/created modern quality concepts and customer expectations rose and what Xerox/Phillips built were now inferior. Copiers are products that can last for 10+ years. All the previous Xerox copiers, which were built in the US, became too costly to maintain and broke down too often.> You don't find it coincidental that Sony and Canon [or any manufacturer for that matter] made good products in the 70's, but not earlier? You don't see a correlation between what Xerox and Phillips paid the American workers, vs what Sony and Canon paid their Asian workers at the time?No. Sorry to say but you are clueless on this. Xerox and Phillips thought exactly what you're thinking, which is what drove them to try to compete with Canon and Sony on price, and this is what killed them. They were wrong. Yes, Japanese manufacturing beat American manufacturing on price at the time. But it also won on quality and lead time.http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/history-of-quality/overview/total-quality.html> Japan's strategies represented the new “total quality” approach. Rather than relying purely on product inspection, Japanese manufacturers focused on improving all organizational processes through the people who used them. As a result, Japan was able to produce higher-quality exports at lower prices, benefiting consumers throughout the world.>American managers were generally unaware of this trend, assuming any competition from the Japanese would ultimately come in the form of price, not quality. In the meantime, Japanese manufacturers began increasing their share in American markets, causing widespread economic effects in the United States: Manufacturers began losing market share, organizations began shipping jobs overseas, and the economy suffered unfavorable trade balances. Overall, the impact on American business jolted the United States into action.> At first, U.S. manufacturers held onto to their assumption that Japanese success was price-related, and thus responded to Japanese competition with strategies aimed at reducing domestic production costs and restricting imports. This, of course, did nothing to improve American competitiveness in quality."
dwt0cs0,salesforcewarrior,"Agreed. However this is comparing the US to Japan, and Japan has a very high bar for quality. I work for a japanese corporation for reference. So I see your point about America digging its own grave, but still don't see that as a reason to say that we can't reach the quality levels that China produces. Reaching Japanese quality isn't the same goal as reaching Chinese quality. China on average produces low quality products. For example, most of our products at the company I work for are produced in Japan. We have some produced in Mexico, in Taiwan, and in Indonesia. Primarily Japan though. We tried using Chinese manufacturers three times, and all three times they failed the quality test (defective parts per million as you stated). Three completely different parts, and different manufacturers.So I was definitely wrong about Sony/Canon as I figured they were Chinese. However the evidence I've seen points to China taking over the US market after outsourcing became the new craze. The direct reason for that was cost. We could afford to engineer products here, manufacture them elsewhere, and sell good products at a comparable rate to US citizens.If we didn't outsource, and invested in our own economy instead, who is to say that we wouldn't have kept up decent quality?I just have a hard time believing that we can complete the task of engineering complex products, but would fail to compete in the simplest part of the process which is manufacturing them without cost being the sole reason."
dwsrdiq,BlamelessKodosVoter,">. However we can look at one factor alone. In America, anything can be accomplished with money. Anything.Except a well made TV"
dwssln7,salesforcewarrior,https://www.techwalla.com/articles/list-of-televisions-that-are-made-in-americaWould you consider none of these a well made TV? I wonder if these TV's would be of better manufacturing quality if they didn't have to compete with TV's manufactured in countries with ridiculously cheap labor. Seems logical to me.
dwsstxv,Plague_of_crocus,"Dude that list is a reach. Most of them say ""some models are assembled in the US"""
dwstnze,salesforcewarrior,"That was kind of my point. Barely any of them are manufactured here, and only some are assembled here. Yet people are trying to say that the US can't compete when it comes to quality. It's an unfair comparison considering that basically nothing is manufactured here. Factor in the reason that nothing is manufactured here, and it becomes a little ridiculous to say that China produces better products. They don't produce top quality products, it's just that the bar is set low because they pay so little for labor."
dwszd1k,Plague_of_crocus,Ahh OK I see that angle now.
dwslvry,amidoingitright15,"Yes, some manufacturing has been moving to those countries but you're being incredibly misleading implying China no longer builds cheap shit. They certainly still do. What's your field in “operations”? As that's the most broad employment term I've ever heard. That doesn't really describe anything.Edit: downvote all ya want, the dude's comments implied something that isn't true."
dwsn0zt,Jaerba,"I'm a supply chain analyst. The barriers to setting up manufacturing are mostly due to infrastructure and training. In general if you're doing a high run, low cost product, it's better to set up a plant in those countries. You'll have a longer runway and lower flexibility, but it'll be significantly cheaper. If you're doing a small run, you'd do it in China as it's much easier to get those kinds of orders up and running, and they're better at accommodating custom jobs. But again, that speaks to it not being such a cheap job.Yes, low quality goods are made in China but only because of setup barriers. If you're producing enough of something and low cost is your main priority, you're better off moving away from China. Plant space around the ports is getting significantly more expensive and if you go inland, now you're adding in higher logistics costs."

Because the only way these talentless blowhards can increase a businesses' profits is to sell the clothes off its back and the roof over its head.The company goes down the shitter a few years later, the execs get eight figure bonuses, and move on to kill something else.

dwsiki7,AskMeHowIMetYourMom,"I'm always surprised that we don't target wages in countries like Mexico and China when looking at things that can be done to protect US jobs.

I've always been a proponent of tariffs levied on industries that pay shit for wages overseas. When a company can pay five people $4 an hour instead of one person $20 an hour plus benefits in the States, it's a no brainer for them to move those jobs overseas. Even setting overseas wage level requirements to half the average industrial income level in the states would make companies think twice about moving jobs."
dwsj7fm,canttaketheshyfromme,"What you're describing is literally the difference between fair trade (countries of comparable standards of living, freedom, etc trading because they have different resources and strengths that complement each other) and exploitative ""free trade"" where wages and labor/health/environmental standards are seen as obstacles that make more prosperous countries unable to compete with borderline forced labor, child labor, and companies that can just dump their waste in the street. It's a race to the bottom to see which country will provide the most labor for the lowest pay with the least oversight."
dwsjiud,AskMeHowIMetYourMom,I'll look into that more. Thanks for the reply.
dwsjaly,BigBennP,So actually we do Target wages in other countries. A big part of large International Trade deals is attempting to push developing countries into adopting more modern workplace safety standards environmental standards and pay standards.

dwssxfj,my_peoples_savior,"i've always thouht that even though china is wealthy, there are still a ton of people there who are considered poor. that may be why they are still considered developing."
dwt71m4,Turbotroll,"They still are simply because they have so much that needs developing. The divide between the development of the East Coast and Central/Western regions, for example, is staggering, even if the population is mostly in the East. China is cash flush right now but it also has a huge chunk of humanity to divide it amongst. Only 5% of China's population is in extreme poverty currently. That's still 70,000,000 people! Nearly a 5th of the US population!"
dwtaixo,AskMeHowIMetYourMom,"Good point. The issue I have though is they are continuing to develop, while large swaths of the US are regressing economically. We are helping to drive the growth of their economy at the expense of our own. Our wealth gaps continue to grow as the companies that benefit from global trade contribute less to our economy. When an area losses 500+ Jobs because of a factory moving overseas, that area also just lost 500+ tax payers. The companies continue to generate revenue while also consolidating their US workers, which leads to even more wealth inequality."
dwtcjm7,Turbotroll,"Yup, I agree. But I don't see how that's China's fault. American consumers vote with their dollars and so long as they decide to buy cheap overseas manufacturing how are American based companies going to compete when the costs of operating in a developed country are higher?My guess is that if development equalizes across the board in several decades then maybe we'll see these things even out. I seem to recall reading an article on how manufacturers in several industries are returning to the US as the costs of operating in countries like China and Thailand continue to rise along with their quality of life (best anecdotal source ever)."
dwte0jt,AskMeHowIMetYourMom,"I don't mean to seem like I'm blaming China. They're simply taking advantage of the opportunity presented. Trade will always be a back and forth with each party trying to gain the upper hand. China has it currently IMO, and a big reason is because of how cheaply they can produce products. At this point do American consumers have a choice with purchasing foreign made products? If someone wanted all American products, outside of the cost I think it would be hard to even find a majority of things people use regularly. Along the same vein, American companies that WANT to manufacture in the States have issues competing with companies that don't. Corporations have shown time and again that they will put profits over everything else, I believe it's up to our government to ensure that workers are protected. Most unions you hear about now are from sectors that can't move. When unions were legalized, manufacturing companies didn't have a choice but to listen to the workers. Now, they can just close up shop and move production overseas. This is our issue as Americans, 100%."

If you put tariffs, less people in those countries get to work and hence even lower wages."
dwssmdx,AskMeHowIMetYourMom,"The whole point of the tariffs are raising wages, less people get to work at a higher wage (not sure how you figure it would lower) and these countries don't get to exploit their workers to gain an economic advantage. As the costs of wages go up, so do the manufacturing costs, bringing them closer to the levels of production costs in the US, making US companies more likely to consider keeping jobs here. I'm not nationalistic by any means, but I do think it's important for the government to help protect job security. It's not for us to put other country's citizens to work. As much as I hope that working conditions and wages improve for overseas workers, that has nothing to feeling our government should be maneuvering to benefit OUR economy. There is not much I agree with Trump on, but renegotiating NAFTA with Mexico is one of them."
dwt1voh,adityang,"Sorry, no. Higher tariff leads to less goods sold means higher lay-off and higher unemployment. And wages never go up when unemployment rises. But your argument doesn't even make sense as it is not clear what do you mean by good wage? you mean same wage as US? How is that fair when there is huge difference in the cost of living between the countries?"
dwt4xlh,AskMeHowIMetYourMom,"Layoffs and unemployment for who, China and Mexico? Not our problem. My suggestion was clear enough for arguments sake, as many others have added to the conversation. These same companies that threaten layoffs when they don't get what they want continue to pay their CEOs millions of dollars and don't bat an eye. They threaten to move jobs overseas to reduce the bargaining power of US workers, removing that incentive by leveling the playing field gives them an actual fighting chance when negotiating. China is a global power that has ZERO incentive to raise wages and improve working conditions because US companies will keep giving them work as long labor costs are next to nothing compared to America."
dwta48q,adityang,"Sure, it is not your problem at all. But don't say wages will increase if there are more lay-offs. Globalization wasn't started by China, Mexico or India. It was started by western countries who thought they can monopolize third world countries with superior products.. now that third world countries have adopted, you are trying to change the rule again.. trade doesn't work like that. Wage is one such ploy. It is fact that wages in third world countries have been constantly raising. It is simple supply and demand.US companies aren't doing any charity by ""giving"" work to those countries, they are doing business.

We buy them with US dollars. Last I checked, China hasn't switched currencies to US dollars. So they have to put those funds somewhere, and often it's in US debt, which keeps our interest rates low and makes debt available for investing in our country.

Why should they profit from publicly funded work done here?"
dwtmg8i,Rottimer,"I think it's funny that you believe that a structural deficit in your account balance will weaken your currency thus making imports relatively more expensive and exports more profitable, but you don't believe that capitalists will take advantage of that.I agree with the intellectual property bit, but Trumps current course of action doesn't address that. You know what would have put enormous pressure on China to do away with the IP theft? TPP. If you could build your factory in Malaysia or Vietnam with IP protections in place, that's a direct challenge to China's cheap labor that comes with a good chance of IP loss. That “free market” pressure would have brought China to the table on that issue.But now? We'll learn the hard way."
dwtt8n7,TerribleEngineer,Oh I definitely believe that capitalists will take advantage of it. I just don't think that it will be for our benefit. As the dollar weakens the US will continue to borrow to maintain standard of living. This will result in higher borrowing costs and higher taxes. In addition people will enact increased labour regulation to prevent job losses. These factors will counteract the weakening currency and offset any structural advantage.

dwse3d0,Going2MAGA,We were losing that many and continued to lose that many after the tariffs were removed as well. That had more to do with NAFTA than tariffs.Edit: Also China joining the WTO
dwsemqd,BigBennP,"Nice squib answer, but:1. Economists substantially disagree. ([1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9701.2005.00722.x)) and ([2](http://www.tradepartnership.com/pdf_files/2002jobstudy.pdf)) 2. [When you look at the BLS statistics themselves](https://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet) (link doesn't capture settings, I set from 1990 to 2018) you can see that manufacturing jobs sharply plummeted from 2001 to about 3Q 2003. Leveled off, and then sharply declined again in 2008, and have gradually recovered from 2009 to 2018 to about half their 2008 levels. NAFTA took effect 1994 and manufacturing jobs actually ticked up afterward, or were stable at worst from about 1994 to 2001-2."
dwseron,Going2MAGA,Economists disagree on everything. You can get 5 different answers if you ask 5 difference economists. Between 2007 and 2009 we lost over 2.3 million manufacturing jobs. There were no tariffs. We continued to lose more and more. My point still stands.
dwsfe13,Rottimer,"Holy shit, did something happen in 2007 - 2009 that you're forgetting about, maybe? Maybe some crisis to do with housing and mortgage backed securities?"

dwsg1hq,Going2MAGA,Read the rest
dwsj2ej,qazeed,"Yeah I did. Did you read /u/BigBennP response? Because the statistics show two major events that lost jobs in manufacturing. One was the bush tarrifs, and the other was a major recession, so I don't see what your argument is. That tarrifs aren't responsible for job loss because we also lost jobs in 2008 during a huge recession?Edit: right on cue Dow drops 500 at opening"
dwsjo8q,Going2MAGA,"Funny since US govt research agrees with me, pointing to Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China being the primary cause.""This paper uses production and trade data from the U.S. Census Bureau to examinethe relationship between the sharp drop in U.S. manufacturing employment after 2001 and the U.S. granting of permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) to China in October 2000, just a few months before the March 2001 business-cycle peak. While trade liberalization is a prime suspect in the overall decline of U.S. manufacturing employment in recent decades PNTR is notable for having had little eect on the taris actually applied toChinese imports""https://www.usitc.gov/research_and_analysis/documents/Pierce%20and%20Schott%20-%20The%20Surprisingly%20Swift%20Decline%20of%20U.S.%20Manufacturing%20Employment_0.pdfEdit: So this govt research agrees with me and says the tariffs had little effect on imports"
dwsmkne,qazeed,"This is the abstract of that paper:> This paper finds a link between the sharp drop in U.S. manufacturing employment after 2001 and theelimination of trade policy uncertainty resulting from the U.S. granting of permanent normal traderelations to China in late 2000. We find that industries where the threat of tariff hikes declines themost experience greater employment loss due to suppressed job creation, exaggerated job destructionand a substitution away from low-skill workers. We show that these policy-related employment lossescoincide with a relative acceleration of U.S. imports from China, the number of U.S. firms importingfrom China, the number of Chinese firms exporting to the U.S., and the number of U.S.-China importer-exporterpairs.This paper's focus is on how the elimination of uncertainty around trade policy has affected jobs, not so much the effect of tarrifs themselves. Although it does state when the risk of tariff hikes decreased that job loss went up, none of this takes into account Chinese retaliation. It's all about making temporary Normalized Trade Relations (NTR) Permanent (PNTR), and therefore eliminating speculation on future tariffs. If both sides increase tarriffs on steel, then steel prices go up everywhere, and manufacturing industries that use steel will be forced to eliminate jobs eventually.I think there's good reason countries go to NTR instead of fighting tariff wars. They just don't work because of escalation. Also NTR include tariffs on goods both countries agree to, so it's not like we have no tariffs on China.Addressing your last point, if tariffs have little effect on imports, wouldn't increasing tarrifs not increase jobs? Which is Trump's whole goal..."
dwsnd0p,Going2MAGA,Tariffs rates were much lower back then & so was the cost to produce in China. The cost to produce in China is also rising. Much of their production is simply for jobs to reduce social tension.

dwsleyy,unusedmonitor2,"> Gol Dang TragedyYes, Gol Dang was a tragedy, but it was entirely preventable. Our troops should have never been over there to begin with. The official rationale - that General Zhao had to be contained within the Gol Dang Basin, because he supposedly had ambitions for the entire highlands and delta region - was a flimsy cover for using American troops to protect Gol Dang's dadgum plantations, especially during the monkey migration season. And we all know how effective that was."

dwsewom,Forristal,"Industrial lubricant scientist checking in.In truth, this one mostly doesn't matter. China has a number of lubrication manufacturing sites that produce stuff that's pretty much every bit as good as the American equivalent. The basestocks are a little different (because they typically use what can be refined locally), but the overall quality available from a Chinese manufacturer won't change much. As a result, most Chinese companies probably use asia-manufactured lubricants already.There will be an odd case where, for example, ExxonMobil might only manufacture a particular product in an American plant (generally more true for greases than oils across the industry), but a Chinese company would easily be able to find a local replacement.I couldn't say how prevalent this situation might be, so I can't comment on how much this might hurt an American-based company, but I suspect it won't be common."

My lab experience with Chinese grease samples hasn't given me a very wide knowledge of the international grease business, or more specifically the RM sources of Chinese greases. But I have to say, every grease sample we get from China has a very distinct smell to it. Like the shoe department of a Dick's Sporting Goods or something. I don't know if that comes from the different base oils, a common additive/polymer, or what, but they all smell like shoes."

Can we get that in the electric car market as well?Global oil subsidies was actually 6.5% of global GDP, or 5.3 trillion dollars. This has nothing to do with my pointing out that Tesla is a bad business model. You're arguing past me."
dwsjhzr,Time4Red,Are you arguing that a billion dollar company hasn't factored the known expiration of a subsidy to their long term business strategy? Really?That's the least of Tesla's problems.
dwsk15v,MrEngineerGuy,">Are you arguing that a billion dollar company hasn't factored the known expiration of a subsidy to their long term business strategy? Really?Strawman arguments are a bad way to have a discussion. I'm talking about Tesla's [dependence](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hy-musk-subsidies-20150531-story.html) on subsidies. With 5 billion dollars of subsidies, it's going to be one of Tesla's most major problems."
dwskexr,Time4Red,"My point is that those subsidies essentially have pre-established expiration dates. Tesla knew in advance when the subsidisation would stop, so the end of those subsidies is already factored into their business model."
dwsl2j7,MrEngineerGuy,">Tesla knew in advance when the subsidization would stop, so the end of those subsidies is already factored into their business model.I don't know if Tesla has. It doesn't seem like it with their current standing. They've had negative cash flow for months. They're stock is falling. They're not producing enough model 3's and their model S has fallen off. 2018 seems like it will be Tesla's make or break year."
dwsm09v,Time4Red,"That's why I said it's the least of their problems. Their problems are related to unexpected difficulties with Tesla 3 production. Economics is not a zero sum game. New businesses generally achieve profitability by increasing productivity. You spend $20m to get $15m of product one year, but increased productivity means you get $25m worth of product from the same $20m of labor and capital the next year. Tesla's growth model was built around a similar very reasonable projected increase in productivity. Rapid increases of productivity would have negated the need for any subsidies. Unfortunately for them, their productivity did not increase at projected rates. That's their main problem. To continue opperating, they will need to increase their output relative to their input over the next year or so."

dwt62u3,someguy1847382,"I'm sure you mean this as a defense of the president. That's cute.

All the while the land is pillaged and poisoned for its resources, the poor are dying or being shackled with life long debt due to outrageous medical costs. Wages are stagnant and with a growing glut of student loan debt and increasing housing costs could start shrinking in purchasing power.What are we doing? Encouraging tariffs which will increase prices while not encouraging job growth because we can't admit that labor is rapidly becoming obsolete. And in the other hand attacking with attempt to gut social services because reasons I guess.This isn't about Trump but the worthless son of a bitch isn't helping the situation and creating and encouraging a climate that will only make it worse.But fuck me right?

My guess is you're a 25-40 year old male with less than a bachelors degree angry because the current order treats you like shit. I get it, but throwing everything behind a man who has been an influential leader in the current system (huge political donor to both sides and once friends with the clintons) expecting your lot to get better is idiocy. He says things that you'll like to make you feel more important and powerful but he won't actually help you.

dwsj3zg,aidsy,"Sure, if that's what they want to do. You don't have to sell stuff there."

dwsxtde,murmandamos,"I imagine Chinese companies feel more like they are taken advantage of by gigantic American companies who helped rig the international markets in their favor. So now China is just like, well, fuck you. I think Americans can't really understand what it's like to not exist in a world that wasn't tailor made for our economy. We have exported capitalism. E.g. Apple hires Foxconn, and even though they have the technology, do the work, etc, Apple gets most of the money. This is just an extrapolation of the employee model, but this favors the entity with starting wealth. Oh, what do you know, that's us."

dwsf3e4,ObeseMoreece,"Their QC issues come from musk forcing automation to be used for every possible step in the manufacturing, I imagine it would be cost effective for him to relent on that with Chinese labour. Plus he doesn't have to worry about workers rights so much in China."
dwsiuzu,brickmack,"China has been automating quickly too. Turns out there are benefits beyond just cost of labor, and those benefits increase when cost of human labor drops because slaves are shit workers.The QC issues are because Tesla iterates so fast, practically every car out of the factory is unique. Good strategy for rockets, not so much for mass-produced consumer goods."
dwsfn7c,Cautemoc,"And China has an expansive production infrastructure they've cultivated over the last decade and are more capable of consistent output at scale. But, yeah, it's China so the only possible reason must be something negative."
dwsgx4b,iamwhoiamamiwhoami,"It always kills me that people have no understanding of why China is such a powerhouse for manufacturing. It isn't even cheap to manufacture most goods there, especially when you factor in shipping costs, but people continue to believe that it's the sole reason goods are manufactured there. Most workers in China get paid maternity and paternity leave, yet the Americans in here love to shit on their supposed lack of rights. The ignorance is too much."
dwsim0f,InstantGangBonus,So what is it? is it because they are so much people and therefore can ramp up your production so fast?
dwslb6b,iamwhoiamamiwhoami,"It's 2am and a lead engineer's team has just discovered a massive error with the design of your product that will lead to a colossal failure. Fortunately the engineer's team has a solution, but it would involve swapping out a key part with a hard to source part, which itself would require part of the manufacturing plant to be rearranged. Now that might be a massive problem with little solution in the US, but in China it's fucking Monday. They'd have the workers up and out of their dorms ready to get to work within 15-minutes. The ""hard to source"" part could easily be located or fabricated in any one of the nearby thousands of other factories within an hours drive. The plant itself is robust and flexible, so changing the assembly design at the last minute isn't just easy, it's a common occurrence that they are used to dealing with. Do you need some type of specialist to help with the design? There's probably about 10,000 to choose from at a moments notice in every conceivable area of expertise, whereas in the US you'd be lucky to find even a handful in a ""large"" city. So yes, it's the massive population, but it's also their expertise, inter-networking relationship between factories, flexibility, and even their cultural comfort with living at their place of work. People aren't just manufacturing in China for cost purposes, they're doing it because the products can be made better and handled more efficiently."
dwugasg,Faylom,"Cool, thanks for the insight"
dwsjpdb,Cautemoc,"Partly that, partly because they've been doing mass production so long they have extremely efficient methods of shipping the products, they also are Communist and can use that system to move people to where they're needed (Americans would shit bricks at being forced to move for their job), they are embracing automation instead of fighting against it like the US, and the workers are paid less when comparing US currency to Chinese currency."
dwskxvz,wyldsoft,... So none of that is negative even a bit?
dwslbd0,Cautemoc,"Well wage difference is a factor of exchange rate. A US dollar is worth more than a Chinese yuan, so if the workers are paid in yuan and the product is sold in dollars, it's not hurting anyone, it's just exchange rates.The only ‘negative' is the govt being able to force people to move. But honestly most would move for a job anyways given the choice of no work. People in the US have a weird mentality about moving to where they can get work, many would rather stay in their small town and complain about not being coal miners anymore."

dwsfqwp,MrSparks4,"China is building like 5 giga factories built by China's GM. The idea is to mass produce cheap EVs for China and India. That means EVs that are a fraction of the price musk is offering. He doesn't want a free market because he'll lose. Some people will say, ""But China will beat us because of their centralized government!"" Yes, that's correct. That's why the US will suffer. Democracy is effective for maximum happiness. Not maximum economic growth"
dwsh2di,iamwhoiamamiwhoami,"The Chinese EVs will utilize smaller batteries too, so they will surely be more efficient than the Tesla, which is among the least efficient electric vehicles on the market."
dwsh7qx,supercheme,"Trump is slapping tariff on Chinese flame throwrs, so at less Elon got that going for him"
dwsqb35,aquarain,It's not like Tesla could even meet US demand for their vehicles before this all blows over.It's other manufacturers who are gonna have a hard time.
dwsrfra,Vassago81,Isnt china the leading producer of electric and plugin hybrid anyway?
dwsdthh,Going2MAGA,Teslas were already tariffed at 25% because of their weight
dwse194,cheers_grills,Wouldn't that just reduce Musk's competition?
dwsea2b,Jess_S13,"Only against other American cars. Just this laast week a Chinese/US joint venture to build electric cars for China and the US was announced, they will pay no tariffs in either country."
dwsegt1,schrodingers_cumbox,"Plus with the Porsche Mission E looming on the Horizon, that may take away some of the higher end Tesla sales"
dwsi207,weepycreepy,"I don't know, who really wants an electric Porsche?Every established car manufacturer has built their brand on petrol cars and the culture that goes with them, which is kind of at direct odds with what electric is about. They've even glorified the downsides of petrol engines like the noise and shat on electric for decades. How the hell are they going to have any credibility selling electric now?I don't think any of them will be able to 180 and transfer any of their brand *at all* to the electric side. They'll need to name their electric divisions something separate, or Tesla will just dominate them from their pedestal not only as the established market leader, but also as the visionary who believed in electric from the start."
dwsiz64,schrodingers_cumbox,"Mate you have got to be kidding meThe Mission E will be a far better built and engineered machine than whatever Tesla is putting out. It looks way better than the Tesla, and also will be geared towards handling and driving experience rather than Teslas straightline speed.Bear in mind the hybrid technology Porsche has been using in its highest-end vehicles and that they invested 2.2 BILLION Euro in R&D on electric systems.To immediately discount their efforts by saying ""oh but Tesla has been all electric from the start"" is ludicrous"
dwsjlu1,weepycreepy,"I'm not saying anything about the quality of the car, just the marketing. I don't think an electric car having a Porsche badge will be seen as a plus. Tesla is enjoying Apple-like levels of marketing hype in this sector, and I don't see one new model of car competing.I could be wrong. I thought the Cayenne was the ugliest piece of shit imaginable, but I still see people driving them."
dwskej9,I-need-MAYO,">How the hell are they going to have any credibility selling electric now?By making good EVs at prices normal people can afford. Well, middle-class people anyway. Like the Bolt."
dwslnh3,weepycreepy,"It's going for 85k. I don't think people looking for an electric with 85k to spend will want a porsche, or people looking for a porsche with 85k will want an electric.An electric porsche is a contradiction in terms. Like a diesel porsche."
dwsmbkk,I-need-MAYO,"I mean, the Porsche is a Porsche. They certainly don't need ""credibility"" to sell, Porsche already has that in spades. It's competing against a car that also costs 85k, in any case.In the portion of your comment that I was responding to, you said ""every established car manufacturer"", not just Porsche. So I was referring to cars like the Nissan Leaf, Chevy Bolt, Ford Focus Electric, Hyundai Ioniq Electric and so on. Which all sell for around 30k."
dwsmzgo,weepycreepy,"I guess I can see economy car manufacturers like Nissan finding a niche if they are competitively priced enough, and maybe old American musclecar makers going into a new frontier of loveable looniness - Bolt is a good choice of name in that regard.I still don't see the space for European luxury car makers, though. Like, could you imagine an electric Bentley? It just clashes too much imo. Honestly, I can't even imagine an electric Renault."
dwso69w,I-need-MAYO,"Honestly, manufacturers like Renault or Bentley practically don't exist in America, so I never even think of them.I dunno about Bentley, since so much of their look is ""big""... maybe they can make some neo-50s electric R-type homages.But I think I just read that the Renault Zoe was Europe's top selling EV last year (maybe that was just marketing). So they're already there, even of it is a supermini."
dwsemo3,BestUdyrBR,Regardless of tariffs Elon Musk needs to focus on his own damn production rates before blaming his company's stock tanking on governments.

dwsni7o,cshaiku,So this is Elon's fault?
dwt7j2y,Lonelan,All vehicles are electronic
dwtezy3,Seattle_Pounders,"The way you pressure a country into lowering their tariffs is by imposing retaliatory tariffs, which Trump did."
dwth4dk,fabled_poster,"China's leading the world in electric cars - by a very, very long long. Not that any American would know this - completely self absorbed in themselves.They are planning on installing more charge points than all the rest of the charge points in the world combined - INCLUDING CHINA which already has the most - next year alone.Hoo-ooo-oooooly shit."
dwtksuo,NotRealSocialism,"China will end up doing what it always does, reverse engineer it and make a way shitter mass produced version of the tesla. They were gonna fuck over Elon one way or another, it's China's MO. If they wanted mass produced electric cars they wouldn't allow an outside entity to take up that much of the market."
dwsjsh2,Andy_Schlafly,"Even worse - Tesla's electric vehicles are the best in the market by range and quality - but the Chinese are rapidly catching up. With tesla locked out of the market by these retailiatory tariffs, the Chinese companies will continue to improve to the point that when this all blows over, Tesla won't even be able to return as it'll get outcompeted."
dwseh81,Gunzby,If you think Trump is alone in this you are mistaken. The EU is doing the same. This is a reaction the China's protectionism that imposes high tariffs on imports while those countries have low tariffs on their imports from China.
dwsebsu,Budapest_,"China wants to lead in electric vehicle with their own companies so this would have probably happened any way. Even if it wasn't tariffs they would have limited what Tesla could have done in China regardless.Any one who has ever tried to actually sell in China will tell you that, especially in certain industries, it is all but impossible. At my last company it would have cost us more to sell in China than we would have made once you factored in all the cost.You can hate Trump, I really don't care either way, but he isn't wrong when he says China doesn't play fair when it comes to trade. They have been stacking the deck for awhile. The whole they can sell to us but we can't sell to them has been happening forever long before any tariffs. We just happen to be playing by similar rules now."
dwsfcb1,RdClZn,"Mate...>The tit-for-tat action comes hours after Washington detailed about 1,300 Chinese products it intended to hit with tariffs - also set at 25%.I don't know if I should take your comment for naïve and misleading or just plain misinformation and propaganda."
dwsl0bx,I-need-MAYO,"[Mate...](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/magazine/the-rise-of-china-and-the-fall-of-the-free-trade-myth.html)Sorry for the mobile link, but anyway, China *does* have a long history of protectionism. Yes, these tariffs were a response to US tariffs, but the latter did not come out of a vacuum."
dwslyyf,RdClZn,"Have you read that article? So does the U.S. So does Britain, and Japan. *Everyone* who's not fed neoliberal propaganda is aware that industry protectionism is part of a nation's development. It's not China's fault that Trump withdrew from the TPP and then erected tariffs on Chinese products. There could be a non-tariff, free trade relation between U.S and China. This was not the path chosen, however."
dwt4gyh,I-need-MAYO,"Fuck no, I just read headlines."
dwsjy9q,Desdam0na,"Pedantry: All vehicles (made since 2000 and probably a bit before that) are electronic. Electronic- (of a device) having or operating with the aid of many small components, especially microchips and transistors, that control and direct an electric current.*Electric* cars are fueled by electricity, in addition to using electronics to run and manage the car."

dwsu6x0,lel_rebbit,Bourbon is whiskey but whiskey isn't always bourbon.
dwsvyls,Dt2_0,"Correct. Bourbon is an American whiskey, and I really don't know the details, but I do know thye use slightly different methods of distilling and aging for Bourbon than other American whiskeys."
dwsx9z1,sharpshooter999,"Bourbon must be 51% corn to legally be called bourbon. It must be stored in charred new oak barrels before bottling, but it doesn't have to age at all. Straight Whiskey is the exception, it must be barrel ages for 2 years. This is what gives whiskey it's flavor and color.Corn whiskey (white lightning, moonshine) must be 80% corn. It must be stored in new oak barrels before bottling but they don't have to be charred. There is also no age requirement and is typically bottled right away with no aging. This is why it is clear versus the caramel brown of bourbon."

dwss1a1,iTwerkOnYourGrave,Jack Daniels bro. The most sought after and imported whiskey in every country on earth.
dwst3vu,danieloplata,"It's mostly known as cheap swill though, that non-whisky drinkers mix with coca cola. For most people, it's probably one of the only whiskeys they know of - and it's exceptionally low price point lends itself to being a cheap party drink which is imported in massive volume.A quick ask around the office (lots of whisky drinkers) gave us the following hierarchy of preference- 1 Japanese/Scottish- 2 Japanese/Scottish- 3 Irish- 4 Canadian- 5 South African- 6 English- 7 AmericanThere are a few of us who've had ones from other countries, but not enough types/times to form any opinion of the countries whisky as a collective."
dwsxh3j,sharpshooter999,"Before I was 21, Jack was the popular thing to have. Now that I'm 27 and have tried dozens of different whiskeys, it tastes like ass. Same goes for other types of alcohol. Started off with Nikolai vodka, now it's Grey Goose or nothing."

Gotta get trump's base upset somehow!My only concern is that people will end up blaming china instead of trump Edit: they really could blame a lot of groups not responsible the more I think about it. Obama for not having enacted tougher trade sooner or some similar bullshit, the dems somehow, mexico and mexicans since mexico will likely end up exporting more to china in response as well as they probably believe the immigrants messed it up somehow, it could be a clinton deep state plan to harm the united states, and im sure plenty more theories so crazy i can't even conceive the idea.

You see how many people already complain that ""China deserves US tariffs because they never play fair""? Now anti-China supporters will have extra ammo to use to blame China being a dick by not opening the borders to the US.What a lot of people may not understand is, some of these produce from US are not even irreplaceable. A LOT of countries want to do business with China and never even had the real chance, until now. Take the meat industry for example: a lot of countries want to export beef/pork to China. China of course does not open these markets to everyone. Only those that are cooperative and friendly would be allowed. Last year Uruguay started to export beef to China. This year, Portugal pork will also soon enter the Chinese market. Now with the trade war with US going on, I would imagine it will be a great opportunity for literally all other countries except the US to try get China to open up their meat markets for other countries in order to fill the void created by US. What baffles me is how Trump has been destroying all the relationship with their trade partners without even a good alternative set up. I mean, has he considered where he would export his abundant beef, corn, oranges to? Russia? Or just let US consume them all by themselves? Buy American, Hire American, Eat American?"
dwsepcs,swolemedic,"I know he's dumb and has no understanding of the global market but it's at the point where I think this shit is purposeful. Some of the sales we have to china are more out of courtesy as we are massive chinese consumers, as you pointed out they haven't always allowed other nations to send the same product, if we effectively price ourselves out of competition through a trade war other nations will secure the market. If this shit lasts for any extended period of time i really doubt we will recover much of the markets we lose unless we had an absolute advantage for that product.Man, we just got out of the great recession and if these actions keep up we're headed to something muuuch worse"
dwsiimg,DismalEconomics,"> I know he's dumb and has no understanding of the global market but it's at the point where I think this shit is purposeful.Maybe... but I honestly can't think of how in the hell this would even benefit Trump, or even those closely connected to him... I guess you can argue it benefits Putin simply because it hurts America so much, but I'm someone who thinks that a lot of the rumored Russian is likely, and even I think that such a economically disastrous move seems way too extreme to be inspired by Russia. My gut tells me that Trump is just operating off his extincts as wealthy NYC real estate who simply used to being able to fuck other people because he's always had so much leverage and/or assets to fall back on. He's operating off hubris and ignorance of global trade .Trump's father was once one of the richest men in America and all that wealth was built off NY real estate.... so there's probably never been a time when Trump wasn't used to being the big shit when he sat at a negotiating table."

Your principals are there, but you're unfortunately at the mercy of China because they are an important trading partner, in my opinion. This punishment hurts you as much as it hurts them, in which case you should find an alternative solution involving the WTO, EU, whatever rather than this half assed attempt of looking tough. The second is general rhetoric about IP which is nothing new.To directly address your claims: I don't think that a trade war will stop any of the IP theft, and I don't think the trade war will stop China from artificially devaluing their currency.

dwsfwkh,grimreapersdtr,CEOs and millionaires sold the US out. They exported their factories and jobs to countries where they could pay bare-bones wages. China only benefitted from the decisions of the greedy American elite.

dwsf4oo,RickAndMortyLuvr,>They have the ability to dick us harder than we can dick them. False.
dwsfh6n,nashrafeeg,Care to explain why it is false ?
dwsg5ja,lballs,Let's say we both bottom out our dicks in each other's assess. China loses 460 billion in exports while the US loses 115 billion in exports. The US has a larger economy to begin with. China gets much more hurt by the ass fucking.
dwsxex1,7point7,"We also lose $460B of inputs into our economy. Now the price of everything rises because raw materials and finished goods just got more expensive. We have to rebuild our mfg industry basically from scratch (do not have the capacity to make all the shit China does) and do the necessary job training and investment to bring us up to speed. That's a decade long investment to bring our economy back to the manufacturing-based economy of the mid-20th century where we can't compete due to cost of labor in other markets. Jobs won't be here immediately so everyone pays more and works less. Also, a lot of jobs we are taking from China will be replaced by machines because costs of production are Chinese labor<automation<US labor. It's why we already have seen automation hit the mfg industry so hard. In the meantime, consumers pay more for almost every product they buy while we are trying to drive our economy backwards rather than focusing on future global economic needs. It's like if Detroit decided in the early 1900s to ban production of automobiles and instead tried to focus efforts on agriculture and animal husbandry. Maybe good in the short-term but terrible decision long-term."
dwt19ia,lballs,"> They have the ability to dick us harder than we can dick them.That is what this thread is about. You wrote about how the US economy will be hurt. I agree with a few of your points and yes it will be hurt. China will be hurt much worse. China losing nearly 25% of its exports would be much worse to its economy than the US losing nearly 5% of exports. Now most of your points are treating this like its US import tariffs on the world but this is completely focused between China and the US. I agree, tariffs against the world to bring manufacturing to the US would be catastrophically disastrous. What these tariff threats have already done is driven companies to seek manufacturing in other places with equally cheap labor. China's primary driving factor of their appeal is the cheap labor and relatively stable environment. While replacing Chinese labor overnight is not possible, recovery would be rather easy and consumers would barely notice. Not sure if China will fare as well losing the billions in specialized imports that are much harder and sometimes impossible to source from other nations. I still stand by my opinion that China does not have the ability to dick us harder then we can dick them."

dwshceo,TheDovahofSkyrim,"Completely agree. While I may actually agree with Trump's stance towards China (one of the few things I actually held similar views on), the way he is going about it isn't diplomatic at all and I don't like it. I don't want tariffs or anything. What I've wanted is IP protection and for China to conduct trade on an even playing field (edit: which means dropping the plethora of tariffs they've had on US and European goods for a while now). We have been making bad long term deals with China for short term profit. Guess we'll just have to see how this turns out. Even though I would normally think the US would ""win"" this (even though everyone is losing really), China doesn't have a democracy so the leaders in power aren't afraid of leaving power unlike our leaders, so the US will probably blink first."
dwsp0ui,TooBadForTheCows,"How do we enforce our IP protections? And in what way is it equitable for China to levy multiple tariffs and then flip out and act offended when we fully suit? I feel that China has been very disrespectful in both aspects.What sorts of diplomatic solutions do you think might have worked? And why haven't they been tried? (Not being snarky here, I'd like to hear some ideas.)"
dwsu2za,TheDovahofSkyrim,I'm pretty busy right now but I pretty much agree with you're first paragraph. In short: I think the smartest tactic would be to implement policies directed at US businesses that do a lot of business with China. Make it so that you incentivize businesses to take capital out of China and move it to other countries with more reasonable trade laws instead for investment.I can go into more specific details on policy later if you want.

Whether you think it's a good thing or not... American corporations have been moving manufacturing to China for over 30 years now in order to increase profits and insure Americans can buy lots of cheap/low cost stuff. Over that 30 years, it's no surprise got pretty fucking good at building factories for a wide variety of products. You can't just snap your fingers and create specialized factories for any product you want in other countries because you Trump decided he wants to be an asshole to China. Yes it's true that many ""low-tech"" goods are now made in other countries, especially South Asia... but that's definitely not the case for more specialized products like Iphones. If you read about the capabilities of the Foxconn factory that make the Iphone, they are fucking staggering. It took Foxconn many years, billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of workers to get the point that they are right now. I've read that even if you ignored labor costs, even if America wanted to create a factory on par with Foxconn it would take many billions of dollars in subsidies and at least 5-10 years just to build a similar factory........and that's still ignoring alot of other factors, like price and labor of construction, access cheap raw materials and supply lines, expertise in running and managing a factory of that scale etc etc... **My point is, there are many products produced in China that we simply won't be able to find replacements for in other countries** **On the other hand, China can easily find other sources of many of the agricultural products they buy from America... It's not like we are the only country capable of making soybeans** **The real danger is that China will simply just establish alternative trade agreements and supply lines for the products it currently importants from the United States... and once this tariff trade war bullshit is over, they will have no fundamental need to go back to purchasing from us... Other countries could easily follow suit and the result will be that many American exports have been permanently diminished if not totally wiped out **Trump is not only fucking the global economy with these Tariffs, he's especially fucking over the United States' economy and American consumers, but most of all he's completely fucking over the job creators and workers in the red states** Pure fucking idiotic hubris that's fucking everyone."

Trade aside, you shouldn't support a country so backwards in it's thinking that they think it is acceptable to manipulate their currency and force their citizens to live a certain way. Maybe we should just incorporate their same standards of living here and give up our freedom because don't want to pay a little extra for things. We have allowed all our corporations to move to china just to screw us over and give their money to the Chinese government. The main reason trump did this was so we would start producing steel within our own country, so when China says no more steel we are left defenseless and helpless to protect ourselves.

The growing Chinese middle class is demanding American, japanese and British foods and willing to pay well above market bc there is little trust in domestic products such as baby formula or medicines. Even if what some are claiming is true that these tariffs will hurt the US more than China(they are wrong), something has to be done to force China to level the playing field which includes ending forced local partnerships to do business in the country and enabling the theft of IP for the benefit of local firms.

dwso6dz,swolemedic,"You think china made a move that hurts them more than it hurts the US? That they're shooting themselves in the foot and didn't calculate their move? Okay. I agree IP is an issue, trump is hardly addressing that in any way that's remotely the right way to do it."
dwsv7pe,tripsearching,"You can not like his choice of actions but every president before him refused to act at all. Trump doesn't deserve the hate in this one specific instance imo.Regarding China, I think if a trade war happens between US and China, China will be in much much worse shape. China can not be self sufficient and their economy is being artificially propped up by the government in a major way. A correction is coming and China is going to be in a world of hurt in the near-ish future."
dwu0a8p,tripsearching,"Also I think China acts in a way that's best for the party to maintain power and control first and foremost. They are enacting tarrifs bc of the optics involved. If it hurts the people domestically, the government doesn't care and in general, the Chinese people are conditioned to never complain, at least not publicly."
dwt93k4,leon004567,"To be honest, as far as food goes, US-produced meat and grains do not have much of good reputation either, mostly due to ractopamine(banned in Europe and China, allowed in NA) and concerns over GMO."

dwsjnf6,Kleoes,"While most of the things you said are true and I agree with, US beef exportation to China is not a large portion of total US beef exports. In fact, until last year China hadn't imported US beef since 2003 (thanks mad cow). So it's just recently been allowed but the market is still tiny compared to our other international markets. But now I guess it won't be growing very much unless the Chinese are ready to pay a premium on something they haven't needed for 15 years."

dwsnut4,stillcole,"So, wouldn't this lead to lower domestic prices for the products on the tariff list? Assuming that the tariffs would lead to lower international sales a higher domestic supply"
dwso2mp,swolemedic,"> So, wouldn't this lead to lower domestic prices for the products on the tariff list?Depends on how elastic the demand is, if it's inelastic or they don't believe americans will greatly increase their consumption with reduced prices then it's possible prices will actually go up to attempt to compensate for their international losses. This also relies on many farms having to find new supply routes.Basically, it depends on the product, because they have production costs they were expecting to meet and while supply going up usually means costs go down it isn't always that simple"

dwsptga,oggie389,"Or, just like when Russia levied sanctions o Turkey exporting goods, they just sent it through azerbijian with a new sticker. Things will continue. If anyone here thinks the status quo has been maintained, then seriously everyone needs to take a bigger course on foreign policy. The first major issue is going to stem from the Spratleys, the point of contention between Vietnam and China over this since when over 200 vietnamese sailors were gunned down in cold blood over the reefs. Not mention the phillipines also has a large stake. Why mention this? Well let's look at the battle of the coral sea back in 1942, why was it important? Why did the Japanese land on new Guinea with the hope of capturing port moresby? Now let's set up Russia and its acquiring of the Crimea, its importance as a warm water port essential for controlling the black sea. Long story short the strategic pawns of setting up the board of chess between nations so to speak, has been under way for some time."
dwsqivb,aquarain,And by hurting farmers you mean billion dollar megafarms. Small farmers don't have a chance to compete with China. It's only when the megafarms leverage mechanization and huge economies of scale that they can do it.

I think this is a very real possibility. Fox and friends will break out their lapel badges again and turn this into some great patriotic duty to buy over-priced American produce. The Trump team had better be pretty damned careful about their own personal procurement over the coming months. Actually .... America probably wouldn't mind, they'd just call him smart for sourcing his own stuff from outside of the US"
dwt6p58,parapoxical,"Not to distract, but your comment made me realize why China's heedless use of antibiotics on livestock is so troubling. If we are importing such a large quantity livestock it's only a matter of time before drug resistant viruses start becoming more common place; that coupled with decades of mismanaging infrastructure plus a strange aversion to preventative healthcare, and boy do I smell a disaster brewing.Edit: Vaccinations to antibiotics"
dwt8kfm,swolemedic,"That's not how vaccines work, they don't cause resistance, antibiotics do"
dwtfskt,parapoxical,"Thanks I had that totally backward. Question though, do you think China's use of antibiotics is overstated or is this actually a foreseeable threat in the future?"

dwsdp9c,Coridan1984,We can't have free trade with them until they take care of their human rights violations and bring the standards of labor up to US/EU standards. The current system is only enabling them at the expense of western labor.
dwse9w1,Swesteel,"Yeah, because being able to exploit cheap labor in China and other countries hasn't allowed us to buy things cheaply for years."
dwseds0,Coridan1984,"Buying things cheaply just means companies haven't been forced to increase our wages. Companies are racing to the bottom for prices, but the more jobs they kill the smaller their consumer base."
dwsh5id,LandOfTheLostPass,"And who is going to buy those cheap goods when people in western countries are unemployable because they demand living wages and safe working conditions? Sure, if you have a decent education and can get a job in tech/management, you can escape that fate. For the rest of the population, I guess they should just pull on their boot straps harder (hit the books harder, maybe?). Basic worker protections should be non-negotiable. If China is going to allow slave like conditions for their workers, they should be shut out of trade with the western world. EDIT: And since we're having fun playing the blame game, I blame Bush Sr. and Bill Clinton for the current situation. Bush Sr. began the negotiations to normalize trade with China and Clinton finished it. Neither of them addressed the rampant human rights problem when we really had the chance to make that happen. Bush Jr., Obama and Trump were all left holding the bag on that one. Though Trump's actions here have nothing to do with the human rights situation and are probably more related to something he saw on Fox."
dwshdse,Swesteel,"> they should be shut out of trade with the western world.Well, sure, but there is no politician in Europe prepared to explain to his/her voters why their flat screen TV just got a 200% markup. Not to mention that *we* sure as fuck can't sell to poorer countries at the prices we'd need to ask for.I don't like it, the poorer countries are basically trading lives for the economic power needed to catch up to NA and EU, but that's where we are.Oh, and we won't go broke as long as we can keep stealing resources from Africa."

dwspc2u,torrentialTbone,There is one thing they can't take from us. The Walmart calendar of eccentric/beautiful people. Mr. August in particular
dwtn027,GlobalLiving,"That's the problem with America: Here, it's climb to the top, be the most powerful and destroy/assimilate your competition. Our country's most powerful entities are incredibly anti-social and destructive."
dwu8w4s,white_android,"Wait a minute here man. The reason why China suddenly has every single product for dirt cheap is because plenty of countries move there for what is basically slave labor. The materials are pretty damn cheap which usually explains the quality on pretty much any dirt cheap item. That goes for every single countries products because after all, you get what you pay for.Cheap labor + cheap materials = cheap productCheap product + cheap overhead + not paying for any clean disposal of waste = some absolutely amazing profitsSprinkle in some tax evasion and next thing you know you have a product designed in the US made and assembled in China and a company worth a couple billion dollars(for fun this paragraph describes Apple)Now with all that being said, we have a global economy and it does pretty damn well with each country having products from others. It's been working pretty good for a long time now. The actual problem here is American Companies, if they just took the bullet and paid employees here a liveable wage and tried to cut back on pollution then the American economy wouldn't be as bad as it is. I mean just swing by Ohio, factory towns aren't doing very great here just like they aren't around the rest of the country. They're dying and there isn't any industry that is coming to take it's place from the look of it."
dwujlcn,I_inform_myself,"I live in Ohio.Dayton and Cincy and Columbus and their outlying cities are doing quite fine.Toledo & Youngstown has always been a stain, and I haven't been to Cleveland ever.Here in Dayton, we can't find enough people for jobs, and we pay high. Operators at my plant start at $25/hr, with only a highschool degree required. Dayton btw."
dwv6ecb,white_android,Lol. Yeah no. Dayton is a hollow shell of what it was even 15 years ago. Majority of the factories have closed. The one doing the most hiring being the Chinese glass making company.
dwv7xoi,I_inform_myself,"Dayton is smaller, and less based on manufacturing than it was 15 years ago. Hell I have lived here my whole life.I wouldn't work at Fuyo, they just had a worker death, and multiple other serious injuries and many many OSHA violations (Chinese company with Chinese work mentality.)But Dayton isn't not that bad. Good Jobs, and really good cost of living."
dwv8ymq,white_android,Because majority of the manufacturing left. Nothing really replaced those jobs lost either. Considering the huge rise in crime and drug abuse since those jobs left Dayton is kinda that bad.
dwvbwci,I_inform_myself,"Manufacturing left?How?Duramax is still pumping away. UDRI still employs many, Cargil, Tate & Lyle, Mahle, Hohman, Fuyo, Appvion, NOV (formerly Chemineer), Clopay, Tenneco (bought out Delco), DRT, Aerilikon there are a few more, but can't remember their names.Then there is a lot of warehousing and distribution in Dayton as well.Just because at the time, the biggest employer (GM) left, doesn't meant Dayton is bad or gone. The majority of manufacturing didn't leave. It may have gotten a little smaller, but it didn't leave. In fact, Dayton had a lot more manufacturing than cars, that is why the city wasn't totally crushed when GM decided to be a Mexican and Chinese company, or when the Recession happened.Manufacturing in Dayton is still very strong.Though, I don't see manufacturing as making a car. I see manufacturing as making a product. Dayton also has a lot of skilled trade service jobs too."
dwsw999,sowetoninja,Trump complained about the same thing...
dwsz4rf,t-rexatron,Which is what he's great at. Partially identifying a problem and coming at it from a weird angle with a simplistic solution that doesn't work well.
dwsz839,Pedollm,"I still remember when the balloons came off. She was fake af, she was a puppet. I thought you meant grandpa bernie tho"
dwt2ktb,TidePodSommelier,"When you dig deep enough, this is a result of Tricky Dick thinking ""It would be a great idea if we could make the US industry compete with what's essentially government backed slavery""."
dwt57ny,I_inform_myself,"Yup. People get all up in Arms because the USA is putting these Tariffs out there.But, China is basically slavery. They are starting to see somewhat of a industrial revolution for environment and safety, and employee welfare. But their industries are so heavily subsidized by the government that they only need to sell enough to make operating costs.Companies in the USA, and most of Europe need to actually make a profit to stay afloat and keep selling stuff.China dumps product into the USA commodity market. They can afford to, because their business are essentially owned by the government, and not private and public shareholders. The Chinese economy is very closely tied to the Chinese government, and the government has control over what companies can and cannot do.It is hard, for the USA, a modern industrial country, to compete with countries like China, India, African countries, and many Asian and middle Eastern Countries that don't have the same Environmental, Health and Safety regulations that Europe, Canada, and the USA has.Hell just because of those three, it becomes more cost competitive to skirt human rights to make your Levis and Carhartts in China, Cambodia, India or an African country than in the USA. The US workers demand higher pay, want benefits, want to feel needed by a company, they want to do good work, but want more recognition than just a paycheck.Third World countries don't have really even governmental regulations that protect people, and the wages are so low, it becomes next to impossible for a company to compete, unless they do the same.Which is where we are today. NAFTA did hurt the American family, because it allowed US companies to make things in Mexico, taking away the payroll for many American families. It also hurt Mexico big time. Both economically, and culturally. I can go into more detail on that if people care."
dwt7gde,Hawkals,"I can see where allowing US companies to make things in Mexico would hurt the payroll for US families, but what would cause that to hurt Mexico? Isn't the idea that they had cheap, untapped labor? By utilizing it, wouldn't Mexico benefit from the exchange?Thanks in advance!"
dwt8vgm,I_inform_myself,"So, this comes from knowledge from a 500 level course I took in college. Which was titled Modern Mexican History.Mexico, has always been behind the US and Canada in terms of economic prosperity, but they were self sufficient.With the passing of NAFTA, all of the USA, Canada and Mexico were changed drastically. Canada probably has fared the best, but this was because they already had higher wage jobs, and good relations with the USA.Mexico on the other hand didn't fare to well. NAFTA took advantage of two big things in Mexico. Cheap labor (very very very low cost of living in Mexico, and much less regulation than the USA), and a lot of agricultural land to plant cash crops on.Economically, NAFTA didn't really help the Mexican families paycheck, in fact, it caused them to be less self-sufficient, especially in areas that had factories built by American companies. Due to the more lax regulations, and lower wage requirement, companies in the USA started moving factories south of the border. What was supposed to improve diversification in the North American economy was really the masked to allow US companies to utilize the cheap work force to make products and make more money without regard to what it caused back home in the US or in Mexico.Culture changes hit much bigger with the agriculture side of NAFTA. Mexico could now grow ""Cash crops"" and sell to the USA without tarriffs, or heavy taxes. Well Mexico had a very diverse background of crops. Millions of acre went from certain crops grown by individual families, to family farms being turned into industrial farms to make corn, soy or wheat. This really hurt the culture, since within communities, certain families would plant certain crops, and trade with other families during harvest. With industrial farming replacing thins, there was no diversification created in North America, just cheap crop at the expensive of Culture, and self-sufficiency.NAFTA was not a good plan. It hurt both America and Mexico (it really didn't affect Canada too much). But to this day still leaves Mexico Scarred, especially because of the loss of their diverse agriculture for cash crops to be shipped to the USA."
dwt9e8l,Hawkals,"So it might have benefited Mexico's GDP, but was overall worse for the average Mexican citizen (via increased wealth concentration)? Or am I missing something? Thanks for your detailed response!"
dwta08m,I_inform_myself,"You pretty much hit the nail on the head.High GDP means companies are making and selling stuff.GDP doesn't necessarily represent the individual's quality of life, nor their actual income.The rich in Mexico, and Rich Americans benefited, no one else really did.Trade Agreements like this need to be stopped.If a country is in need of something that it cannot produce, then an agreement should be made. But by an large, Trade Agreements are not a good thing when they are over arching, only when they are specific to goods a country needs."
dwugtei,Mylon,Expensive goods creates an environment where there's incentive to automate the production of that good. This gives us technological innovation. Resorting to cheap labor is stagnation.
dwtem6r,noumuon,"> But, China is basically slavery.Except for the whole getting paid part, and having choice to go elsewhere thing. There's a reason the major cities are getting more and more overcrowded: people are choosing to go there to find work."
dwu0q9f,absurdrock,Not completely true. China heavily influenced people to move into the city as well. They basically stopped rural ways of life to get people to move into the city.
dwutiyg,Lovebuttbuttlove,"I'm pretty sure in China you aren't allowed to leave your home city. They have a pretty large crisis of ""illegal immigrants"", that are just poor people that have moved to the city but can't use any services or send their kids to school.And that was from npr not fox news."
dwt3nq3,-The_Blazer-,"I'm not sure if you're referring to past tariffs (which were never condemned nor matched) or these ones, but dumping is a precise activity with a definition, you can't put ""anti-dumping"" tariffs under some vague ""protecting my workers"" pretense - your tariffs aren't ""anti-dumping"" just becaus you say it.Dumping exists (and thus tariffs against it are permitted under WTO) when country A sells product X to country B for a price which is lower than than X costs in country A, or lower than what A normally sells X at in other countries. Basically it's like predatory pricing, but international. Effectively you're undercutting your own market for the explicit purpose of hurting someone else economically."
dwt4lyn,I_inform_myself,Which is what China does in the USA Commodity market.
dwt87h6,jankadank,Has more to do with being anti-trump than the actual policy itself..The fact China has been hitting countries for decades with unfair tariffs is irrelevant
dwt91vd,I_inform_myself,"Right now it is disturbing. So many people in the USA are against Trump. That they think what he is doing is horrible, and will hurt the USA.The government doesn't create business, it opens opportunities for it. If China can't flood our market with cheap shit, people need products, it opens opportunities for Americans to make a quality good over shit made in China that is made without quality or regards to human or environmental safety."
dwu891t,white_android,"That's not how a free market works. That's not how supply and demand works. You seem to have this odd idea that this trade war is somehow a good thing, that China not taking imports from us on certain things won't hurt our economy. Just like back with Bush that's the wrong idea. Believe or not these tarrifs are meant to hit hard exactly where it will hurt Trump the most, where his majority of supporters are. Hopefully he'll follow in Bush's footprints and end it before it gets too far."
dwujmw6,I_inform_myself,"Never said it was a good thing.But good can come out of things like this.Rely to heavily on exports, and you'll have yourself in a world of hurt when a government decides to go a-wall."
dwv6mbl,white_android,Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.The past shows pretty well that no good will come out of this. Unless you think being fined is a good thing or a trade war which will end up stacked against us.
dwv7ydo,I_inform_myself,It will end before it starts. That is my prediction.
dwv930h,white_android,I don't think you'll be right... I mean I'd hope you were for the sake of the country but with how headstrong trump is and how he doubles down on stuff it'll probably be worse than Bush.
dwvblc6,I_inform_myself,"He may double down.But with his short history, he ""doubles down"" but backs off fairly quick.He is a dog with a big bark and that it it. But it is also how he has gotten to where he is."
dww0ojt,white_android,"[I don't like this and I assume you don't like it very much either... ](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/04/05/trump-asks-us-trade-representative-to-consider-100-billion-in-additional-tariffs-on-chinese-products.html)He's already laying the ground for a *nice* little trade war with China, the fines are going to suck ass but I guess in a way it doesn't really matter."
dwwrqns,I_inform_myself,So nothing has actually been done yet?Everything has just been proposed?
dwsq4rm,Minsc_and_Boobs,So it's okay for Europe to do it but bad when the US does?
dwsquxl,TriloBlitz,I personally see nothing wrong in anyone doing it for protecting local economy.

dwsw2dd,bene20080,"You may get the impression, but it certainly isn't true."
dwt8hif,jankadank,Its very much true
dwsuf5l,PorschephileGT3,International trade nuances are such a clusterfuck.
dwt3cpz,icantredd1t,So whyyy is the us considered assholes when they make the same tax and bans?
dwucmmh,TriloBlitz,Because of bandwagoning. Someone says it on the TV and all the others follow blindly.
dwugmy5,Thasoron,"Because the US allowing a trade deficit on their own currency to happen was part of the US hegemony's soft power. It allowed the western Industrial countries to grow at the expense of the US. Something the US could live very comfortably with since they started to use hedonic pricing in the nineties in order to calculate their GDP and hence create phantastic business figures, which where used to borrow more money, which improved the GDP, hence more money could be borrowed. That is why the US has an umpteen Phantastillion public debt. And it works as long as the US dollar is the lead currency in the world. But for how much longer is now the question. Europeans want to buy oil for Euros (something Dubya Bush tried to contain by occuppying Iraq, who was the main offender in selling oil for Euros) and China holds so many Dollars that their own currency would definately become a lead currency, should they ever allow free exchange rates. What Trump has inherited here is a complex CF of US political instruments, economic necessities in a changing world, and the results of unfettered globalization - ironically mostly driven by anglo-american companies, leaving the US and the UK populations as the main losers behind, because they lacked the social security that other European ""welfare states"" had in place (now also deteriorating)."
dwum067,demintheAF,... but it's bad when Trump does that.
dwunt58,TriloBlitz,"Everything Trump does is bad these days, regardless if it's good or bad."
dwt027f,WatNxt,Photovoltaics
dwtjhf7,iH8_people_inGeneral,I hate when people prevent me from dumping
dwtvdfc,Sobieski526,Such as? Just curious which products are affected.
dwul9no,TriloBlitz,Someone here already mentioned photovoltaic panels.But I have a Chinese friend who has mentioned several times in conversation some Chinese brands of apparently good products which I'd never heard of because they can't export to Europe.
dwsjqk3,alastoris,"If this trade wars continues, it will give Canada and Mexico another chip to play on the negotiating table."
dwsdy0m,PlushSandyoso,I don't think American producers would even comply with anti GMO labeling requirements
dwt52x1,Silverseren,I wish they wouldn't anyways. Europe's regulations regarding that are idiotic and in direct conflict from what their own scientific organizations are saying. Though the fighting between the French National Academy of Science and the French government has been fun to watch for the past decade.
dwtybk9,WAR_T0RN1226,The products in the US carrying a non GMO label should be required to come with an asterisk saying that there's no discernable difference in food safety
dwsluqk,TheBeasSneeze,"Luckily for Europe, the US standard of food is below our safe standards."
dwste9l,MCXL,It's funny that you believe that.
dwstsck,Noxianguillotine,funny because true ?
dwsuww6,MCXL,"No actually, funny because the EU has taken an auntie science stand point in being anti-gmo but other than that their food safety standards are generally lower than the United States.Of course the GMO thing is actually a pretty big deal virtually every outbreak of E coli in recent years has been traced to organic crops often from Western Europe; remember the green bean outbreak in Germany?In fact up until very recently Regulators in the United States were far more cautious across the board. The only reason that that's changed is we've sped up are regulatory processes based on the fact that week make companies pay for it instead of having it be completely publicly-funded. I think there are downsides to that, but the United States regulatory approval process has a long-standing history of successes in most cases.This is an interesting little examination of relative risk taking:https://ssri.duke.edu/sites/ssri.duke.edu/files/Wiener_Duke_Food_Working_Group.pdfVirtually all the differences in standards that the EU has are purely political in standpoint. I will say that the United States allowing antibiotics to be given to beef and other meat agriculture is bad, however that doesn't reduce the quality of our food, that's a whole different kettle of fish."
dwsy4al,axelG97,"The source you provide has very little to do with your claim. What on earth made you think that European food standards aren't much higher than American? It's simply not true. Unless you have an actual credible source about this topic, why should anyone believe what goes against common sense?"
dwt56da,Silverseren,"It depends on what part of Europe the food is coming from. If it's from Austria, where the government mandates that sick animals are only treated via homeopathy, yeah, I agree the European standards are lower."
dwtbmiz,iloveyourdad69,"That can't be true, please provide a source."
dwtcak1,Silverseren,"Sure, here's a PDF about the organic farming system in Austria (and, mind you, this system makes up almost 100% of the farming in the country). You can tell it's official, since it's published by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Environment and Water Management. And here's a quote from the relevant section:""Should animals fall ill, natural curative methods such as homeopathy or acupuncture must be applied whenever possible.""http://www.bhutan-network.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Organic_farming_in_Austria.pdf"
dwuk40o,g0_west,"That's nuts. Do you know if by ""must be applied"", does it that mean ""must solely be applied""?"
dwuvg8o,Silverseren,"I think other medicine are possible, but as the later section notes, you have to have them be specifically prescribed by a veterinarian that has a license to do so. In short, their regulations make it difficult (and probably expensive) to use real medication. You also have to keep a very descriptive log of every single actual medicine you give an animal."
dwuvbot,iloveyourdad69,"I just checked the German version and it says that they must be the first try if possible. So it's not a must and it only concerns organic animals, but it's still weird."

dwsudpt,TheCheeseGod,"Wow so less global trading entirely... more internal trading. Less demand for international currencies and more demand for resources which are required in each country.

dwxkd1a,Aujax92,"Less GDP growth with protectionism, yes. I'd be hard pressed to call anything yet though, we might live under a global corpocracy in the next few decades anyways."

I'm searching and all I can find is articles that say the same stuff as every other article does about this trade war, but no lists. They mention batteries and TVs, but they are very vague.

dwt6qlc,ilhaguru,"Dumping might not be such a big problem if China increases demand for European products. For that matter, this rebalancing would prevent a price increase in Europe caused by higher Chinese demand."
dwtb67m,farahad,"I don't understand this. When I go to a market in the US, the difference in commodity prices is usually >25% between ~identical brands, never mind the difference between American made and cheaper Chinese products.

""My brand of honey just went from $4 to $5/lb, looks like we'll buy the $4.50 European honey now"" just isn't how *most* Americans buy....[anything](https://i.imgur.com/HYfsuJ9.jpg). Or is it?

dwsh111,icanhasreclaims,"What most people fail to understand is China is able to produce goods cheaply because the only regulation they have is making money for the republic. There are no such things as child labor laws, minimum wage, 15 minute breaks, or workplace safety standards. And that doesn't scratch the surface of the environmental neglect which occurs in Chinese factories. When the regulations are added to products created in the USA, the priced in value on many of the items you consume daily will likely now become unaffordable."

A position that we're very unlikely to improve if things were started from scratch following an actual trade war IMO. Also ""dumping"" is getting used wrong a lot itt. You generally have to have some political mechanism producing something below market value in order for it to be dumping."

dwt2ano,ArchmageXin,">Racism in Star Wars is a tendency that was first seen in the prequel The Phantom Menace. Most notably, Jar Jar Binks, as creator George Lucas himself acknowledged, is based on such African American stereotypes as Stepin Fetchit, Amos and Andy, Sir Jim Crow and ""Jamaicans, mon.""http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Racism_in_Star_Wars"
dwt2e8u,douko,"I picked up on antisemitism and the ""Thai"" accents of some of those aliens, but I never viewed Jar Jar through that lens- thanks!"
dwu2vje,xinorez1,"I didn't make the connection until I watched Deutschland 83, which by and by is an excellent mini series produced in Germany and subbed in English.Apparently Jar Jar's accent is a real world accent.

dwsf7zn,penguin_kingdom,"Does anybody actually understand the premise of the Phantom Menace? Something about space tariffs between members of the same state and space corporations with armies that have a seat in the senate.Edit: Now that I think about it, why did Palpatine even have Maul involved? There was no need to kill the two Jedi. He was able to become Chancellor regardless of the result of the Battle of Naboo. Instead, he revealed the sith. Thinking about the Phantom Menace hurts my head."
dwsfx6c,Bananasonfire,"The Trade Federation didn't like the idea that The Republic was taxing their trade, so they invaded Naboo with the intention of getting Amidala's official support in The Senate when it comes to voting against the taxation of trade routes. Naboo has some pretty serious political weight behind it, so if they vote for something, generally the rest of the senate votes with them."
dwsg1fp,penguin_kingdom,And all of this was orchestrated by the senator of naboo in the first place. Well except for the kid destroying the spaceships.
dwsxvak,wwfmike,Yippee!
dwsxqt4,Justicar-terrae,"To answer the edit, he was working with the Trade Federation. They were only going through with the blockade because he assured them that they could profit from it. To do so, they needed to secure their victory in the senate and escape pinishment for the invasion/hostage situation. Their solution was to force the Queen to sign the treaty legalizing their invasion (somehow). Maul was sent because the Queen could not be captured by ordinary forces (she had Jedi bodyguards). Palpatine leveraged Amidala's escape to secure the Chancellorship, but that was a backup plan (leveraging the chaos to become Chancellor was the plan, using the Queen's presence was improvisation). Once the Queen decided to return to Naboo before the Senate could decide the fate of her planet, a new window opened for capturing her and forcing her to sign the treaty. Maul was sent to stop the Jedi guards so that the Trade Federation forces could capture the Queen. Anakin's lethal spinning destroyed the control ship though, and the TF had no other forces to prevent themselves from being captured. Palpatine lost two pawns that day because his sith apprentice (pawn 1) got too cocky and because the TF (pawn 2) was defeated by a child. Palps then decided to make that kid into a replacement pawn.Edit: some bad typos."

The country is divided and we aren't going to get millions of people to compromise with millions of other people. That's the reason we have politicians. The whole point is for the politicians to work together with one another so we can get the best of both worlds. Instead of lashing out, we need to give support to our representatives who are actively trying to work with the other side. Reddit is guilty of this shit as well. If any Democrat doesn't vote along party lines they're shamed here, but when it's a Republican who crosses the party line they're given a pat on the back and applauded. If we want a more efficient government then both sides need to support candidates who are willing to cross party lines. Candidates who says, while I don't agree with Issue A, the people I represent see Issue B as the bigger issue, so if you give in on more of Issue B then I can compromise more on Issue A. So on and so forth. Idk I'm just ranting again. I also think that corporate lobbying needs to be obliterated but that's a whole new rant."
dwt4jo2,DarkCrawler_901,"As one of those Europeans with ability to vote for more then two parties, looking at this outside...one side is actively trying to destroy your country's image abroad (and has mainly succeeded), sell every asset you have to rich people, and trying to stoke hatred against various marginalized groups to achieve political power as a rule, not as an exception. One side is failing you by not fighting against those things hard enough (being a big tent party instead of a vehicle for white supremacy), but still fighting against those things at some level.Maybe try to deal with the **former** first before engaging with this ""both sides"" shit, because looking at from here...while I never would vote for the equivalent of the Dems in my own country (them being firmly center-right) if the choice was between them AND a party that resembles the ultra-right-wing religious/neo-nazi lunatics pulling single digit support here (Your ""moderate right"" is our ""conservative"". Your ""Republican Party"" is our ""fucking insane death cultists""), I would have no problem sacrificing my political beliefs to avoid certain destruction.

dwtdhls,not_so_plausible,"I agree with you 100% but I feel like you're making a different argument. I'm saying that both sides are failing us in terms of working together to make things better. It's always the same exact shit and progress is stagnant at this point. You can point the finger at conservatives and while I completely disagree with majority of their view points, there's obviously people here in America who see it differently. If there wasn't we wouldn't have this issue. Right now since neither side is willing to compromise whatsoever, we're just building up one parties form of government only for it to be torn down four years later and be rebuilt by the other party. You can call me a both sides person if you want, but don't assume I agree with both sides. You're saying all of that as if the conservative side is a small subset of people when it's not, what is a small subset of people is the amount of extremist conservatives that have felt they have found some sort of a leader for those values in Trump, and they're very loud about it. I personally don't believe a majority of conservatives agree with those types of people and just value conservative economics. Everything you're describing as conservative is what you've heard from the media and probably Reddit. Majority of them aren't racist assholes trying to destroy our country. If you want to continue to believe that go right ahead, but that's just making the issue worse. They'll ignore us and call us socialist liberals while we call them conservative nazis. Let's just keep doing that because that will solve the problem. The media loves it though so at least we are helping them out."

How is Obama announcing the biggest sanctions on Russia ever being a ""pushover"" but Trump sucking Putin's dick at every chance while being a bitch child over signing further sanctions is being tough on them? I'm serious, I need actual examples here to respond because I have absolutely zero fucking idea where he has done that. Post me some links?"
dwt8vrf,FearMe_Twiizted,"I have no idea where you're getting your info. Hillary has been publicly owned since bill gave her a job. She literally was involved with watergate that's how far back her corruption record goes. How is kicking Russian ambassadors out of the country multiple times “sucking Putin's dick” I'll never know. I don't even think you have access to free press where you live. Europe is censoring a lot of news. That's how far off your statements are. You saying it's stupid easy to make fun of us, but you have no idea what you're talking about. Just about everything you just said is completely outdated information. Muellers first find was the trump Russia dossier. WHICH HE THEN FOUND OUT WAS PAID FOR AND CREATED BY THE DEMPCRATIC PARTY AND HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMP JUST VAGUE MENTIONS OF HIS NAME. So the whole reason he started the investigation was on a lie. And what proof has he found? I just read an reticle today about him saying trumps not a criminal which means they have found literally nothing. One more thing, I don't know if you know this but CNN spent 90% of its air time smashing trump. Only 10% left to Hillary and other stories. Even with real damaging shit coming out about Hillary. Wait I almost forgot, her biggest donator was time warner cable. And who owns cnn? Time warner cable. Funny how that one company can reach so many people and push their own agendas. Which is one thing trump wants to stop. Sure trump isn't perfect. He's definitely not my ideal president. The only thing I want is some one who's going to get something done. If trump is firing people, to me it looks like he's looking for some one who will get the job done. There's that nut job lady pushing for gun control for like 30 years named Nancy pelosi or some shit. How are you going to let some get paid day in and day out to spend 30 years FAILING. Dems should of fires her and got some one who could get the job done and things might be different. And that's what Hillary has done. Spent 30 years failing the people. She has not been apart of anything real. How has she been in public office for 30 years and not accomplish anything and still move up the ladder? I'm not voting for that person. All she has done is the equivalent of suck her bosses cock for a promotion. Trump may not have many policies but for only 2 years as a politician? He's already doing better than Hillary's entire career. Not to mention trumps career is a massive fucking success. The only thing Hillary is better at, is playing the political game. It's not about how good your policies are, it's about how bad you make the other person look. And she does that real well. But trump played the political game AND the electoral college game. He had rallies sometimes twice a day all over the place while Hillary had maybe one a week in her height of rallying and was purely surfing the political game to win. But she under estimated him and failed once again. Sorry I don't want an incompetent person in office who can't beat a “tv Star” or a “business monster” or what ever other insults tickle your fancy. Just know that your party was dumb enough to lose to trump. I didn't touch on one thing I wanted to. If you watch his beginning rallies, the first few after him saying he was running, he talked about Russia and fake news before anything even happened. He said this was going to be what happened. He's been one step ahead of all that shit and been very public about it. I think the only thing that's caught him off guard is Danny summers or what ever. But even that is already fading away as a story. This is another reason why i think you're using outdated info. Either using outdated info or haven't done enough research to form your own opinion so you're just being a sheep."
dwsfmx9,chazwmeadd,"You get it then lol, I'm an ultra-lib trying to exist in Taft. Conservative cesspool."
dwsg2v3,A-through-Z,Yea I totaly do my friends were either not political so they were ignorant to whats going on. Or they are conservative. You can tell by what they post and how they somehow think their way is always right. At this point I pic and choose who I talk to I love my friends but I couldent start political talks with them bcause it end up in name calling and bashing other things. I'm good on that. i consider myself a independent I love guns I love the town I'm from but I realise that things do need to change the town is going to end up being abandoned if the oil industry closes shop. You just have to come with facts and stats to counter their argument which most are easy that's why most people will tell you to shut up liberal.
dwskw6f,redditusersmostlysuc,Well I am a republican trying to exist in Seattle. Liberal cesspool here. Feels like I am drowning. Didn't vote for Trump but hate Seattle's politics.
dwsl35j,thelateandgreat,Care to elaborate on those policies that you don't like? Genuinely asking.
dwsn9ka,MacDerfus,Well I hear you can't get on the city council unless the port of Seattle's cock is in your throat.
dwt01gc,redditusersmostlysuc,"Yes, I could go on for paragraphs but here are just a few.1. Allowing people to live in their RVs parked along the road to Alki Beach. There is a law that people can't park their vehicles for more than 3 days. Seattle City Council wants to circumvent this law and ever proposed that if a vehicle is towed that the city has to pay the owner back for the towing and impound fee so that in essence the city would stop towing so they wouldn't have to pay the fee. So don't fix the law, just try to get around it.2. The Seattle City Council passed a law allowing people to put up tent cities wherever they wanted to. There was an outcry because tent cities would be allowed ANYWHERE. City parks, sidewalks, etc. The council amended the law.3. There are tent cities all over the place near downtown Seattle. There are laws in place to keep people from just camping in open spaces, but nobody is enforing them. Now we have a HUGE homeless problem, drug problem, vandalism/theft has drastically increased near these tent cities, tons of garbage, and my wife does not feel safe walking alone at night now. Yet if people put up a tent city next to the mayors house or city councils homes they would be cleared out immediately.4. The city has filed 30+ lawsuits against the policies of the Trump Administration. They are spending more time and money (massive amounts of money) fighting policies than just making policies and governing the people of Seattle.5. We are a sanctuary city. This is total crap. When a federal agency asks for information on a someone that has been arrested, give them the information. Why all of this fighting and wasting of taxpayers (my) money over stupid things like this. If the person gets deported they were here illegally so makes sense. See point #1, fix the law, don't try to get around it.6. Drug shoot up facilities are being put in place. Like to do drugs? Great! Come shoot up at the Seattle City Drug House and then have a place to sleep and eat when you are done! Oh, and it will be in a neighborhood somewhere near where people live, even better!These are just some of the great ideas and politics I live with on a daily basis. Again, not that my way is the only way, but come on. Common sense policies (thought I would use the favorite phrase of the democrats) would be to not allow the things above and try to solve them through policies. It is hard and our politicians are just not working for the common citizen."
dwt869z,shrike92,"On point 6 specifically, data shows that's the best way to deal with it (gets people off of it and costs less). You're probably the type that would rather imprison everyone but the data doesn't agree with your viewpoint."
dwtj2i4,redditusersmostlysuc,"Dude, way to jump to conclusions. Think this shows how open minded (not) you are. My viewpoint is don't setup places for them to do it. I know it happens but do I really want to provide them a place to do it? No. These sites are about saving people from overdoses with one or two success stories coming out of them from thousands of people using them. Again, goes to do I think the government should be providing these types of services? The answer is no. Provide shelter (where a person has to be clean and sober, no drinking and no drug use allowed), provide assistance in the form of cash, mental health, job assistance and education assistance. Do not setup a site for them to do their drugs. The issues with these sites (at least the one going into Seattle) is that they don't have the other support pillars in place so they will just be a place to use drugs. The arguments made about these facilities are the same that are made about the tent cities, give people a place to go and put them in touch with support systems and it will be better. The tent cities have not been better and crime has increased. Residents are frustrated (https://hpacinfo.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/hpacmyerswayencampment-2018.pdf) and the city has not responded or added resources. This exact thing will happen with the safe injections site. So no, I don't believe that setting up the site is the solution without a commitment to the other legs of the stool to hold it up. It is just throwing bad money after bad and it will create issues for the residences in that neighborhood. I don't think we should lock them up, but I also don't think we should enable them either."
dwtui2e,shrike92,"I definitely agree with you on that. The approach needs to be holistic to have any chance of working. I'm not familiar with Seattle's specific situation but I'd hope they're working on the other legs of the issue too.Unfortunately I think the restrictions you're putting on getting government assistance, while not on the surface unreasonable, just don't work because if someone is an addict, without help they're never getting off."
dwusvmv,redditusersmostlysuc,Let me just say this. With all of these great programs in place across the country (and in Canada) addiction is still on the rise. What the entire North American continent is doing isn't working. Not saying I have the answers but I am not an expert so I should have to have the answers.
dwth160,iREDDITandITsucks,So you are mad that poor people exist like in any other city?
dwtjppv,redditusersmostlysuc,"Not at all, I am mad that the city isn't dealing with it in a way that is constructive and helpful. It is creating issues in the city from tourism to (q13fox.com/2016/09/17/seattles-homeless-problem-targeting-tourism/) to safety and other issues. Seattle just keeps moving these people around with no plan of how to tackle the issue (http://q13fox.com/2016/02/11/rv-safe-zones-ignites-more-controversy-as-many-worry-about-lawlessness/). How about a plan, that does not require me to pay another $3,000 per year in property taxes (that I cannot afford) that will get this under control? There is no plan at the highest level, and that is what makes this a leadership issue. I can tell you this though, with the existing plan the problem has just gotten worse. So with that in mind maybe trying something else is in order?"
dwsqm3z,Kep0a,"I like that you say the exact same thing, just flipped, and yet you're in the negative. 🙄"
dwt09eh,JustThatOpinionated,Perhaps not everything is magically equivalent.
dwt1rbr,Kep0a,"Man, how aren't they equivalent? Lol. Everyone denies it, but being Republican and on Reddit is like mixing bleach with ammonia."
dwth4ol,iREDDITandITsucks,"Yes, if you cling to republican ideals then you will probably be called out with facts and logic. Besides, reddit is more moderate. Try talking seriously about UBI or gun reform and you have great debate and questions. Like our law makers should be doing."
dwu0qh5,JustThatOpinionated,Then the market has spoken.
dwsv49y,redditusersmostlysuc,"I can hate the politics without hating the people. That is the difference, and it is not a subtle one."
dwshbw6,pfabs,Come to Connecticut where Democrats have chased all the jobs out to other states and riased the cost of living to unimaginable levels. Maybe I can't afford my property taxes but at least my son's teacher getting drunk before school will live nice on her $6k+ a month pension.
dwsidnj,masternater10,Bro supply and demand doesn't exist. Keep on polishing that Trump dick. Enjoy the stock market!

dwsmyl5,pfabs,Trump is a vote I might someday regret but that day hasn't come yet.
dwsyxer,CrimsonNova,"Please, I honestly want to know, how and WHY are you happy with Trump still? What has he done specifically that keeps your support, and what on earth could he do for him to lose it?This is the biggest mental issue I'm having with all this. The internet has skewed my mind so much, I can't even fathom any sane person still supporting him. Please, educate me."
dwszjml,pfabs,Right now he hasn't done anything to lose my support. As a veteran I know a lot of us are really happy he is getting rid of mentally Ill people being allowed in the military.
dwt01ns,CrimsonNova,"Okay, since I'm not satisfied with that answer, I'll rephrase. What about Trump makes you want to support him? What about everything he is doing and has done is good for the country and the American people?Second, is getting mentally ill people out of the military really that important, and is it a big problem? That seems like a very specific thing to focus on."
dwt0ffw,Ruefuss,Hes talking about trans people. Some people care more about how you express yourself then your simple conduct. God forbid someone with a dick wear a dress. They must be deranged/s
dwt0sl4,pfabs,Transgender people are mentally Ill and have the highest suicide rate in modern society. I have close friends that are trans. I support trans people in everything except military service.You can't join the military if you have even the slightest medical history of mental illness. Why would we make an exception for the people with the highest rates of suicide???
dwt1qxa,Ruefuss,"Trans people have the highest suicide rate because of how they are treated by society (as pariahs). The fact most choose to kill themselves after being treated they way they are, rather than killing the people who malign their very existence, is a miracle in itself. You try living in a world where parent are more likely than not to kick you to the streets or mentally and physically abuse your for expressing yourself (in a way that hurts nobody). Or a world where legislators make laws to specifically make your life more difficult. Where religious leaders you've grown up with tell you you're going to hell. Where entire communities you trusted turn their back on you. Where you have to fear random strangers beating or killing you for not acting “normal”. Their rate of suicide is a direct effect of statements and attitudes like yours."
dwt3b9o,pfabs,"Show me anything to support your claim that their suicide rate is because of how they are treated. The fact is no other mental illness would be allowed into the military ESPECIALLY with such a high suicide rate. You need to fix the suicide rate and the mental illness before you can argue they should serve in the military. What about my attitude towards trans people? I have nothing but positive attentions for them, which is why I don't want to put someone with a high suicide into a career with a high suicide rate. It isn't fair to trans people and it isn't fair to the military."
dwt52f7,Ruefuss,"The mental illness isnt being transexual. Its the depression and anxiety associated with how they are treated. If you feel like nobody is willing to accept you and all there is to life is rejection and abuse, you tale the only positive step you can see in a depressed state.

dwsmnew,EpilepticBabies,"Well, seeing as the government's power is derived from a mandate of the masses, if the people don't think you should have guns, then you shouldn't have guns."
dwspvwg,BossaNova1423,"Ehhh...this is one thing I'm a little iffy on. Constitutional amendments can't be overridden by a simple majority vote, and “the masses” aren't always right. If a town is 80% white, for example, and all the white residents think the non-white residents should be lynched, does that mean they should be?"
dwsqjxz,EpilepticBabies,"That's a good point, but when it comes down to it, guns are a luxury item much more than a necessity, unlike life. I'd be much more open to regulation over a ban if guns were considered a privilege and not a right."
dwsrnna,wowmansohacked,If people think you should murder minorities then you should murder minorities. Do you see why your argument is terrible?
dwtagrr,EpilepticBabies,"I would agree with you, if it weren't for the fact that the lack of gun laws is resulting in hundreds of death of children. People are, for all intents and purposes, voting to let children be gunned down. Let me ask you, are you pro child murder?So maybe when it comes legislation concerning privileges, such as guns, a mandate of the masses is the correct thing to listen. Maybe next time don't misconstrue an argument about people's right to own objects as being the same as killing people."
dwtas56,wowmansohacked,"As soon as your argument becomes ""for the children"" you really should re evaluate what you're thinking. It's the same chant that social conservatives used to oppress guys and minorities. Protect the children from evil HIV infested guys and protect children from the evil blacks who commit crime. Now it's protect children from the evil guns. All three of those arguments are authoritarian in nature. I hope you understand that."
dwtd98q,EpilepticBabies,"So you're saying that you do support the murder of children. Children are literally being killed, and you side with the group that wants to kill them. Also, don't put words in my mouth. Leave your shorty arguments to your own side and stop trying to respond to the shitty arguments that you make in my stead. This isn't a case of “being gay is indecent, wont someone think of the children”. This is a case of children literally being killed, and you're saying that's ok. Perhaps you're not smart enough to make that distinction, but I should hope that you're not truly comparing outdated views on the gays to the deaths of children. Banning guns is about as authoritarian as banning ivory, which is not at all. The main difference is that it's children dying instead of elephants and rhinos."
dwto1a3,wowmansohacked,"Nobody supports killing children. More children die of obesity every year than guns, however I don't see people marching to ban corn syrup from school. This argument for you isn't about children, it is about people using them to gain a false moral high ground and take away the rights of people, especially minorities, and the right to self preservation. I hope you realize you're a racist, as gun control effects minorities far more than whites. Go join the KKK or the NAZI party meanwhile. They both believed in the same ideas that you support.I can see that you're just going to attack me instead of my argument which you failed to address. Thanks for admitting you lost."
dwtrp1o,EpilepticBabies,"Now you're not even trying to make an argument, you're just projecting. Food can only kill the eater of said food. Guns can kill more than just the shooter if the gun. As for moral high ground, you're still picking the side that defends people who shoot children, and which provides them with all the necessary procedures to do so. I'd say that it makes me smug, but unlike you, I'm not someone who can enjoy a dead kid every now and then. As for gun control effecting minorities far more than whites, I'll simply say show me the stats. And make sure that wherever you provide happens to control for gang violence and inner city violence in general. It should also probably control for state, education, and other such things, but I'll leave the harder bits out for you. In case you weren't aware, there's been a law for a long time preventing the government from studying gun violence, so it's going to be pretty difficult for you to support your case. You absolutely have a right to self preservation, but are you seriously saying that a gun is equivalent to self preservation? If you're getting mugged, pulling out a gun will likely get either you or the mugger killed. If anything, it invites death, as the moment a gun comes out it becomes kill or be killed for the assailant. Lastly, you're the one attempting to discredit my arguments by calling me a nazi. Now you've made the mistake of the fallacy fallacy. You think that I've used the character assassination fallacy, and therefore have discredited my argument. While I admit I have been accusing you of supporting child murder (which you totally are). However, I have not used that to actually discredit your argument. I've responded to each and every part, making the character assassination irrelevant to my argument as a whole. You support the continued murdering of children. Maybe you don't condone it. But you do support it. Live with that in your mind or change how you vote."
dwto2qf,wowmansohacked,"Also, what gun law would have prevented parkland? There isn't one."
dwtqesk,EpilepticBabies,"Simple. No one over the age of 21 is allowed to buy a gun. That one is barely even restrictive, but the kid, 19, bought his rifle. Thorough background checks would also have worked."

dwsge7i,chazwmeadd,"No, no it's not. I'm very liberal. I own guns. My friends here who are liberal, most own guns. Like 80% of the adult population here own firearms regardless of political ideology.

dwshkbg,Kancho_Ninja,"I would shut up about the whole gun issue if there was a mandate to keep unused firearms locked away in steel safes in a location with an alarm system and penalties for gun owners if their firearms are stolen through negligence.I'm tired of reading about the ""victims"" who had their guns stolen from their glove box when their cars are broken in to."

dwtb7dm,SharksFan1,I completely agree. Way to many citizens blindly vote for their party regardless of who is running and their stance various issue.

dwsxw9b,myheartisstillracing,"Several months that ago (prompted, I eventually realized, by a story run on Fox News), my mother asked me if I knew that Lincoln was a Republican, as if it were a fact that would have been hidden from me in my education. When I said that of course I knew Lincoln was a Republican, she asked if I also knew Democrats were the party that supported slavery. Umm, yes? I am aware. But was she aware that the parties planks had shifted over the years, along with party affilition?I was so confused as to why I was having that conversation. Finding out later that it was a Fox News talking point at least clarified the motivation. My mother is not a dumb woman, but I guess she wasn't paying attention to politics when she actually lived through the 60s as an adult."

Also in the last couple decades, whites in rural areas and whites w/o a college degree have moved to the right pretty far too. I think fundamentally it all comes down to cultural issues. Democrats are the party of out groups, republicans the party of in groups."
dwtf10n,wyldstallyns111,"> Democrats are the party of out groups, republicans the party of in groups.I'm not sure this analysis makes sense. I wouldn't call poor whites in the South an ""in group"" exactly. They probably identify with rich white corporatists like Donald Trump, but they aren't in that group at all. I think they feel very marginalized and that feeling is powering their (IMO, unwise) blind loyalty to the GOP."
dwtge0e,Five_Decades,"Whites are the in group. Native born people are the in group. Christians are the in group. Men are the in group. So naturally the more you align with these 4 values, the more republican you are. Lots of people feel marginalized in modern America. Gays, blacks, immigrants, etc. They don't vote republican. Also the reason the base of the GOP feels 'marginalized' is because they are used to being on top of the socioeconomic totem pole, and now they realize that the rise of non-whites, women, gays, non-christians, etc. means they have to share America and share power. They don't want to share, so they feel oppressed. Feeling angry that you have to share power and prestige isn't the same thing as being oppressed, but to the GOP base it is."

I hear that you like and identify with the democrat ideology, and that is great. It just doesn't meet with reality that the US is the only country with the republican ideology. France, Italy, the UK, Germany and many other first world nations are facing the exact same kinds of issues and have the exact same kinds of politics as in the US, people just don't hear about it as much. Take a look at the nationalist movements in those countries. The UK is doing Brexit because of these issues. Italy and France have very successful nationalist parties.Trying to protect our borders from people crossing illegally, trying to deport those that are here illegally, trying to protect our intellectual property from being stolen, wanting government to take a smaller role in our everyday lives. Those are not bad things, those are just things you don't agree with. You need to separate Trump from being Republican. I am a very proud republican. I don't no identify with Trump and many of his policies, but some I do and when I do I am not ashamed to say it.There are many facets to being republican. Being republican doesn't mean I hate gay people (my sister is gay and happily married), trans people, or welfare. There is such thing as the far left (those in the democratic party that are out of the mainstream) and the far right (those in the republican party that are out of the mainstream). Then there are those republicans in the center. I voted to Obama twice, I often vote democrat in Seattle because some republican candidates are too far right.Be open to ideas of what a party really is about, not what you read in the news. Republicans want small government (doesn't mean no safety net), fiscal conservatism (which both parties have lost their minds on), individual liberties and responsibilities (which is where republicans and democrats are far apart right now on the responsibilities part), they want power closer to the people (not government to have the power), strong defense of our nation and tolerance, inclusiveness and optimism (again both parties have lost it on this one). Those are the principles and foundation of the party regardless of the far right and what they are doing. I try to live up to those. I may not like the democrats views on things, and sometimes it makes me angry, but I try to be open to different points of view, I listen to NPR, I read CNN and I am married to a democrat.All that being said, don't just get your opinions of either party from the news. What the news shows you is what people will watch; the far left and the far right because it is like a train wreck, you just can't look away.

Republicans are just happier overall than Democrats (https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/opinion/sunday/conservatives-are-happier-and-extremists-are-happiest-of-all.html).

It is very typical for my employees to not show up several days a week but I cannot fire them because I have no replacements that are willing or capable of doing the physical labor or factory work. I hope someday to change to shift work in the hope that I can attract college students/parents or anyone else looking for a simple part time job in our packing plant. My industry is not one in which the average employee makes $20 an hour. I'm an owner and I don't make $20 an hour or anywhere close.

dwslqzf,Mjkittens,I would honestly like to understand better about the regulations that are at issue. It's my understanding that many farming industries receive subsidies from the government so I've always wondered why farmers would then want smaller government. No judgement - genuinely want to understand the specifics. Thanks
dwsxb0p,bopp0,"I'm a specialty crop farmer, industries like dairy and grains get subsidies but specialties (fresh fruits and veggies etc.) do not get help. I'm also in an industry in which harvesting is not mechanized at all so it is all done through legal migrant labor which is very expensive. After FSMA was passed, the amount of regulatory bodies we had to answer to increased, the amount of inconsistencies between them, and how unknowledgeable and ununderstanding (? Haha) they are about our industry is very depressing, frustrating, and scary. I couldn't begin to explain all of it but a good little read on the subject is a New York Times article [here](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/business/picking-apples-on-a-farm-with-5000-rules-watch-out-for-the-ladders.html) . Thank you for your nice response! I'm not trying to upset anyone with the things I say, I just experience the realities of being an up-and-coming medium scale farmer every day and have an intimate opportunity to talk with people who have been farming for 50+ years."
dwt0p85,Ruefuss,Could you expand on how legal migrant labor is expensive compared to other options?
dwt2c9s,EmporioIvankov,It *almost* seems like the issue is they have to pay them a fair wage due to regulations...I'm just commenting here so I can see the actual answer later.
dwt33ay,Ruefuss,"I agree to an extent, but its also the customers willingness to pay. I wonder how people would react to significant rises in fruit and vegetable costs? We already cant stand weird looking fruits and vegetables. God forbid we pay a few cents more to buy the “perfect” ones on the shelves. Pickers need to be paid living wages and food needs to be safe to eat. Regulations are necessary. But the growers are often eating their profit margins in the process, and those margins are already fairly small."
dwt8ngd,bopp0,"This answer is pretty accurate. Where I live there is no labor force for unskilled jobs. Most people view agricultural labor as too difficult, not paying enough, and some even believe it's beneath them. So since the 70s my farm has utilized the H2A program and hired legal workers from Jamaica. This forces us to pay the Adverse Affect Wage Rate which is currently about $12.83 and well above minimum wage. Not much of a problem except it takes about 150 people to pick the crop working 12+ hour days every day. And the way the program works, anyone local that works the same job must also make the same wage. So 90% of our workers must make at least that. 100 of the men stay for only 10 weeks during harvest. Another 20 stay for 6 months. Another 20 stay for 9 months. We provide all housing and amenities while they are here.The tough thing about ag work is it is very physical, you are out in the heat and the cold and the dust and the rain and no matter what when that crop is ready you have to do whatever it takes to get it in. 9-5 work days are right out. We work from 7am or earlier until everything is safely put away at the end of the day. It's also difficult because we and many other farms experienced devastating hail loss AGAIN. So we rely on insurance to pay bills because apples with hail marks on them are unsaleable by federal grading standards. However, insurance only pays out when we can prove a “lot” (or one farm location) is packed and shipped. Problem is, different cultivars are harvested at different times and then put away in sealed rooms, so we will only get pay out once we've sold the entirety of our years' crop. Which means we have very little income until then because of the nature of our crop insurance, we can only sell the good fruit as low grade and don't get the money it's worth. ALSO in my industry, we do not determine the prices we sell our product for, the buyer does. We are also expected to pay the trucking. It's just how it is. So this time of year we are paying our full time labor, trying to save money to pay for all of our incoming workers, making new investments for next year including staggering chemical and fertilizer bills, and we have no real income. Sorry this seems like one big run on sentence. Was this info helpful at all?"
dwt9pso,Ruefuss,I appreciate the comment. It discusses the complexity of the farming industry beyond workers who are not here legally and are paid under the table. The more illicit stories seem to be the ones that get told and I was unaware of your particular labor situation.
dwteult,bopp0,"Thank you so much for your kindness and civility. I think my family's farm exists somewhere between the enormous operations in the midwest and Cali, and the tiny hippie hobby farms that seem to be popping up. I think we're a good example of the average farmer and it is a lot different than what you typically hear about. I love to speak on the subject even though I still have a lot to learn myself, and I truly appreciate you “listening”! Please let me know if you ever have any questions."
dwtinfh,Mjkittens,"Very helpful! Thank you for taking the time. I was off reading the article you linked, googling Adverse Affect Wage Rate and digging into the FSMA website. Thanks for the productive afternoon :DWhat struck me about the article was how familiar all of it was! I work for a large corporation and we deal with creating efficient compliance processes that address truly important issues like safety and anti-corruption - but when implemented incorrectly can cripple normal operations and just cause people to go around all the rules even more (I guess i work for the equivalent of Whole Foods in that article). It's just that I never connected any of these laws and policies (aka regulations) with anything *political* - they were just laws we had to ensure the company followed to not avoid getting sued, bad press, etc. I hope that simplifying rules and creating common sense regulations *should* be something that is non-political. Food safety is a good thing, but having thousands of rules that are hard to understand don't help that goal at all. I don't think abolishing the agencies and repealing all laws is the answer - but neither is piling more laws on old ones without stopping to ask what's achievable. And I'm sure the politicization of these issues fuels the oscillation between these two nonsensical extremes. Regarding adverse affect wage rate- Am I understanding that correctly as a tax meant to protect US workers from foreign workers “taking their jobs” at a lower wage- but in actuality you just end up having to pay foreign workers more as there's not a supply of domestic workers to take those kind of jobs? I guess this strikes me as the type of regulation Republicans would push rather than Democrats? That's another example of why I asked my original question, but I do wish someday we could address these issues without the politics. We all want lower unemployment, efficient costs that drive small business productivity, and safe, non-exploitive work environments. That shouldn't even be a dem vs. repub thing.This was so long, I forget what post I am in! But thanks again for the education. Really appreciate the sharing.Ps any links to help undress why dairy/grain is subsidized and apples are not?"
dwtjl0s,bopp0,"No worries! What a great response. I'm always happy to hear how we can relate to one another. It can be head bangingly frustrating, and as someone just working their way into it-terrifying. Not only do the decisions I make affect me, but so many other good people. It's a lot of pressure. The experience I seem to understand is that when Dems are in power, regs increase and attention paid to farms seems to decrease a bit, things get messy. I really don't think any farmer is happy with anyone in government ever, though. I'm certainly not. I don't know a ton about the origin of AAWR but that is correct. We always have to have one bed open in case any local person wants to work we MUST give them a job over a foreign worker and it is very expensive for an industry with no harvesting mechanization.You're so right, so many of these issues require such simple fixes. Literally just someone in government talking to a farmer, but it is so difficult. Anyway, I adore this response! Thank you so much for taking an interest in this issue it truly means the world to me. And I don't have a link but I do believe those crops continue to be subsidized because they are considered “staples”, there's a whole history to the government subsidizing agriculture... That I should definitely remember more of because it was beaten into me in college... Anyway I bet a google would yield a fantastic wiki rabbit hole. You're awesome!"
dwt0h3l,Dr_Girlfriend,Why not try some other profit-sharing model with your workers? I'm familiar with speciality crop farming abroad and that's what some other regions do in lieu of hourly wages/salary structures.

dwswuuz,Dynamaxion,Well up until Trump the Republicans supported trade agreements. Obama and the GOP Congressmen pushed the TPP for example while Democrats opposed it. Bernie likewise was very anti trade.
dwt63c3,Radriel,"To be fair, Bernie wasn't against trade per se, he just believed those trade deals opened us up to exploitation on too many levels whilst only benefiting a few industries. That and most taxpayers wouldn't see most of that money in their own pockets anyways."
dwt9bc3,Dynamaxion,"Trump says the same thing, he would never say he's against “trade per se”"
dwtsjwp,Radriel,"It's a valid thing to be wary of foreign actors within one's economy. Fair trade is possible, but usually requires that the industry lobbyists don't unduly manipulate the people writing up the trade agreement. Well, I'm not sure what specific qualms Trump had, but I'm glad he stopped those terrible trade deals."
dwtt717,Dynamaxion,What provision did you take issue with specifically?
dwseeyk,whiteguythrowaway,everyone's a Democrat in California
dwsfmak,Admiralolz,"Definitely not, the state might go Democrat in the presidential election but it sits somewhere about thirty to forty percent Republican."
dwspci2,Kakarot_faps,To be fair every so called red state is about 30 to 40% democrat as well. That's like not calling Alabama a red state

dwsytr8,Quetzacoatl85,No complaining about useful regulations isn't; and doing it while spreading misinformation and half-truths even less so.
dwszfgu,Quantentheorie,I'm actually pretty pro EU regulations so by no means was this supposed to be a complaint. It was just intended as some good will mockery that it sometimes *looks like* they are picking things to regulate based on what would be a cool thing to order a bunch of. And I mean there *is* a [relatively new regulation for French Fries](http://www.foodandwine.com/news/european-union-beligan-fries-food-safety). Of course it tries to cut down on the cancer - it would be really ridiculous if they *actually* regulated stuff just to keep themselves busy.

dwsqcng,cloggedb,Levi's are good ya dink
dwswurq,onmybike1,They are significantly thicker than other normal priced brands of jeans if you buy them at a local non-chain store. There's a hispanic western store near me and the Levi's they sell are way heavy compared to my cheap Aeropostal/Wrangler/whatever junk.
dwsxl74,Khornag,I find them to be solid and fit well. Here in Norway they're really big.
dwtfebl,RanaktheGreen,"Levi's are supposed to be heavy, they are in theory supposed to be more durable."
dwt11n6,reklameboks,"Levi's sold in EU are mostly Made in Italy, and the quality is superior to the American made, that you can buy in European outlets for cheap."
dwt7o4c,MumrikDK,"Harley is a very American thing, both as a concept and as a brand. It's in Europe, but it's totally that American thing.Levi's is just a mainstream name brand of jeans. You'll find them everywhere, though perhaps not as much as in the 90s."
dwsqsb5,-Answer-me-,I ride Levi's all the time
dwssuoj,BiddyFoFiddy,I went to Germany for the first time in my life last year. I have never seen so many people wearing shirts with a big LEVIS logo in my life.
dwsgipj,smiffynotts,"Came here to say this. It strikes me that the soy bean producing region is basically the rust belt states which swung towards Trump in the last election? China really aren't interested in the products, they're interested in punishing Trump by damaging his vote."
dwsj7f1,whichwitch9,"To be fair, China was also already angry about US soybeans undercutting their own soybean production. Im surprised it took them to the 2nd round to tax it."
dwst4v9,machocamacho,I'm just surprised that Ohio and Michigan produce that much soy tbh. It only makes sense for them to target Florida next
dwt7kdh,destrucci,It's one of the reasons Honda is in Ohio. They ship the Soy back in the empty containers they bring over for car parts. Instead of shipping them back empty they are filled with soy.
dwtauyq,smiffynotts,They got Florida with oranges I believe.
dwu4mq2,el_muchacho,That's the idea. The EU did that as well until Trump excluded the EU from the tarriffs. It didn't take long for him to back down (less than 2 weeks).
dwsaxbg,Bizmuth42,"That is why I like China. They target the problem. Unlike Trumps random weird sanctions, these are intended to cause a specific effect."
dwscn0g,TauntinglyTaunton,"The difference is intelligence, you gotta respect a smart move even if it sucks from your perspective."

dwsds86,truemeliorist,"The problem is you also need intelligence for that move to have the intended effect. I don't see Trump voters drawing the conclusion ""Oh his policies are bad, that's why I am now losing my farm."" Instead it is going to be the fault of the Chinese and liberals."
dwsfxz6,Athrowawayinmay,"Fuck-em. End result is going to be they lose the farm no matter who they blame.

dwsha7o,pangzineng,"literally Wikipedia> In 1963, when Xi was age 10, his father was purged from the Party and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan.[22] In May 1966, Xi's secondary education was cut short by the Cultural Revolution, when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight their teachers. The Xi family home was ransacked by student militants and one of Xi's sisters, Xi Heping, was killed.[23] Later, his own mother was forced to publicly denounce him as Xi was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. Xi was aged 15 when his father was imprisoned in 1968 during the Cultural Revolution; Xi would not see his father again until 1972. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi Town, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement.[24] After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches.[25] He later became the Party branch secretary of the production team, leaving that post in 1975. When asked about this experience later by Chinese state television, Xi recalled, ""It was emotional. It was a mood. And when the ideals of the Cultural Revolution could not be realised, it proved an illusion.""[26]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping#Early_life_and_education"
dwsqlzp,dexmonic,"Wow he really has gone a long circle from being punished by the government to running it. The communists did indeed fuck his life up, parading him around and killing his sister, raiding his home and forcing him to labor. Thanks for the information."

Commentators attributed the ability of the Syrian government to continue to operate from the base to the fact that the US gave Russia, Syria's ally, an advanced warning regarding the strike, which enabled Syrians to shelter many of its aircraft from the attack."

dwsgwp5,Pfadvice332,"Where do you come up with this nonsense? The tariffs on Chinese products by the US are just as calculated as the tariffs on US products by China.China is playing a short sited game by targeting based on politics. The US is targeting based on actual economics. The problem is that China has much many more levers to pull because they can force their domestic ""private"" companies to bail out or prop up any failing government programs/investments.China's strategy may end up working but only by playing dirty."
dwso9ro,sarge21,Except Trump should have known that this would be the response. If the Chinese tariffs work then that means that the US tariffs were not calculated well.
dwssux5,Yosoparletheshishi,It was the most obvious response by the Chinese lolAbsolutely anyone knew this was going to happen

dwsj49q,BluRidgeMNT,Why?
dwsjide,thepensivepoet,When children are acting like dumb little shits I generally root for the adult with a belt in their hand.We're all stuck on this planet together and need to start acting like it.
dwsk3t5,BluRidgeMNT,China has already had unfair trade practices (including tariffs) in place that put the US at a competitive disadvantage for years. At what point does the US try to find some balance in the relationship? Or are we suppose to eternally get shafted? A company can't even exist in China unless it is 50% Chinese owned.
dwsmuf8,thepensivepoet,I have no problem with that but you don't make moves like a petulant child and just throw out random tariffs without understanding or even considering the full impact of that decision. Unless I missed some followup details somewhere Trump caught most of his own staff off guard when he announced those. Of course the GOP fell in line and went on damage control afterwards but that doesn't change the impulsive nature of the decision.It's really unfortunate that American businesses and livelihoods will have to suffer just so he can learn that he's not the genius badass he's convinced himself that he is. Firing everyone that disagrees with you and only hiring the meekest of sycophants is a bad way to run a business and an even worse way of running a country.

dwt7eko,Bizzle_worldwide,"We're really belabouring this metaphor. It doesn't matter whether the plans are good or bad. What matters is nobody has a fucking clue which commitments to its people, or the world, America will honour in 10 years, in 4 years, or even in the next 12 months. If the US was enacting shitty policy that everyone knew was going to be shitty for the next 5 to 10, they could plan accordingly. Trained and mobile individuals and companies could leave. People could budget for it. Companies could make plans and increase prices. Countries would know what they could depend on the US for, and erect barriers of their own. There isn't even a guarantee of shitty policy, or policy of any type, which means everyone involved is held hostage by uncertainty."

The only way to affect our elections is to get more of the democratic/liberal voters to move from the east/west coasts and back to the mid-west states that swing affect the electoral college the most. But very few Americans seem to see the truth so it's fair to say we're best known for a war criminal and an idiot, we deserve, but as people we have little to no recourse."

dwsh51d,socialistbob,"The target isn't necessarily Indiana but Iowa, Wisconsin and Ohio. All three voted for Obama twice before flipping for Trump and Iowa is the critical first caucus. If Trump becomes unpopular in Iowa it could provide an opening for another Republican to primary him. Wisconsin is the home of Paul Ryan who may face a competitive election this year. Wisconsin also has a senate seat up for grabs. Ohio is one of the big swing states and it's hard to envision a scenario where Ohio votes blue in 2018 and 2020 and Trump wins reelection."

dwsdxqr,MissPiggysBastardBro,I'm no picture creator master. But here's a link showing the counties who voted for Trump. http://brilliantmaps.com/2016-county-election-map/
dwsi77i,sammithesheepishlion,"And all the rural areas of Iowa that voted for Trump are now dealing with the consequences of their actions. Major agricultural products from our state: corn, soybeans and pork."
dwsh9tp,PokeEyeJai,"Yea soy is a major one. Because while America produces a shit ton of soy, very little soy is consumed in USA. Americans aren't fond of tofu or soy sauce to the same extent as the Chinese are. This one definitely will hurt."
dwt9c6y,ALegendsTale,"I agree with everything you said except your statement that ""very little soy is consumed in USA"".I think many people don't realize that it's not only the humans but also the animals that consume it. Most of what livestock are fed is soy meal because it's the cheapest and supposedly the most nutritious.Additionally, humans in the US eat more soy than they realize. Soy isn't only consumed through traditional foods like soy sauce and tofu, but it's also consumed largely through packaged products. Most packaged products I've come across contain it.Almost anything in the ingredients on a food product that is labeled as ""vegetable, plant or bean"" is made from soy. There are other labels too which might not be immediately identified.Some of the most common examples of this are:* Vegetable Oil (accounts for almost all of the frying oil in the US* Protein* Lecithin* Emulsifier (in almost all chocolate)With all of that said, soy is still produced in extreme excess compared to what we need in the US alone. Hopefully the end result won't hurt us too much."
dwse3v5,emorockstar,Yay Minnesota! 😬
dwshi5o,lutefisky,"I've got family who farm soy and corn in MN. I believe, from their conversations, that they voted for Trump. Not because they particularly liked him but because they hated (irrationally, in my opinion) the alternative. They struggled through the 80s and consolidated their farm when other families were getting out of it and by the mid 90s their persistence paid off as the values of these crops began to soar. I don't think this will have a lasting impact on their operation but it's gotta sting as my uncle prepares to hand over the keys to his sons. Sometimes we chose with our hearts, not our heads, in an effort to hurt someone else and it ends up sticking to us like dog poop on corduroy."
dwt3fud,emorockstar,Appropriate username
dwt502b,withinreason,"As pleased as I am with our state in many ways, we have to keep in perspective that Minnesota very nearly went for Trump as well, we absolutely should not consider ourselves a solidly blue state."

Also, Utah native Evan McMullan took 21% of the state's popular vote running as an independent with a lot of support from anti-Trump republican voters, which threw the R:D ratio from about 70:30 closer to 50:30, which is what the map I linked shows."

And I have to go to a store all the way across town to buy bread now cause none of the normal groceries stores sell bread without soy :( And don't have the time to make my own bread or the space or money to keep a bread machine.

dwsskbg,sammithesheepishlion,"Thankfully it's not a corn allergy, but I had gestational diabetes when pregnant with my daughter, which puts me at higher risk of developing it down the road—plus family history. Seriously, companies add sugar and/or corn syrup to just about everything."
dwssnql,sammithesheepishlion,Thyroid would've been my first guess for you too. Maybe I should get a thorough allergy testing done too.
dwswku6,zzaannsebar,"It's a good idea, I mean I found out I was allergic to a lot more than I thought. Example, I've always known I had pretty bad outdoor allergies. When I did the allergy test, I found out I was allergic to every type of grass, tree, and weed that they tried. Like they do a baseline test of straight histamine and my reaction to trees was about 4-5 times larger than that :/ same thing happened with dust mites. But I also found out I was allergic to almonds (which likely means I'm allergic to other tree nuts too), egg yolks (I already knew about this one), and soy.But I thought it was kind of funny, my allergist was actually surprised by my reaction to the outdoor things. He ended up prescribing me Singulair because I've tried every antihistamines on the market by now :("

dwsmedi,Im_Matt_Murdock,"But when the President is discussing financials, I think it's understandable that someone would bring up his financial history. Makes logical sense to me.Whether it's been used in the past as an argument is irrelevant in this current scenario that is being discussed."
dwwb626,Apoctual,"How about the fact that he's a billionaire, then? I can just as bluntly throw that financial history up, and people will sit and argue about it, too. My point is that it's parroted without people understanding the full context."

This whole trade war started because the Chinese are taking our IP so that they can develop a higher tech economy.Trump doesn't have a strategy, let's stop pretending that he does.

dwsu6mj,user_48217,Because it's actually worse for your country's economy. You're wasting resources building products you could just buy for cheaper somewhere else.
dwsujgb,eyelikethings,But then your country loses out on the jobs and sends the profits to another country. Also the quality of the cheaper product is worse.

Why are you paying house builders/car makers/miners for those stuff instead of doing them by yourself and let yourself keep the profit.Capitalism is NOT charity. If your country want jobs and profit, then CREATE VALUE. Have you checked the economy of the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Singapore, etc.? Those guys don't even have really sizable industry, but they are fucking rich, just by TRADING, and other SERVICES.

dwswneo,Cirtejs,"The great economic idea of the 20th century was that countries like people shoud also specialize. If the US is good at making planes, it should just focus on making planes and buy the rest. This means that everyone benefits from free trade and deeper specialization since no country produces everything it actually needs. The tradeof is that this makes manufacturing inflexible. If you wanted to respecialize or diversify your manufacturing, you'd be shit out of luck since other countries would have already set up infrastructure to where their products are cheaper and better quality. This is a very simplified explanation to a complex topic, but thats the gist of it."
dwsw5uu,AileStriker,>Also the quality of the cheaper product is worse.That isn't always true when it comes to international trade. Labor rates weigh heavily into product cost and u.s. labor is just way more expensive than places like China. A Chinese company building the same U.S. product will be cheaper even if they have the exact same quality standards.

Thus the internal logic ofthe ILGWU's protectionist argument leads to an insistenceupon absolute self-sufficiency, to a total economic interest in forgoingtrade with all other people, and self-manufacture of allitems necessary for well-being.Why don't you grow all your own food? You have a 100% trade deficit with your supermarket - you always buy things off of them and they never buy things off of you - so clearly you are losing out on extra employment opportunities and sending profits elsewhere."

dwtqwcu,uglymutilatedpenis,"Nations are made out of individuals. The trade deficit is caused by individuals. It's not like Trump and Xi Jinping sit down at a meeting and decide how much trade is going to happen on the behalf of each nation - ""Hey Xi, the USA is going to buy $300 billion worth of stuff this year, but only if China buys $250 billion worth of stuff from the USA"". The trade deficit is caused entirely by individuals like you or me making small purchasing decisions. Everytime you buy an iPhone or some trinket off AliExpress you contribute towards the trade deficit. Every time a Chinese person buys a game off of Steam they reduce the trade deficit. Looking at the individual is absolutely relevant to analysing the overall trade deficit, because it is the individual who causes the trade deficit."
dwsufhe,Freechoco,"Because support products that aren't our best at producing is wasting our resources into inefficiency.There is a line of how much we should depend on other nation products for lifeline goods like foods, but overall it is almost always better to let the cook cook and you spend the time not cooking building computer instead."
dwsv79i,eyelikethings,That makes sense. Hopefully people will buy the computer you build over the imported computer.
dwsyedp,Freechoco,Well realistically we design computer and software more so than physically building them. Look around the world to see how many people run their pc on window and use OSX on their phone to see if we have been doing a good job.Not to say we shouldn't try to protect our ip against China more though.

With limited competition quality isn't as important, and boom you have $2000 worth of crap, but it is nearly the only option so I guess you buy it. Now you don't have the extra $1400 (difference in price) to spend in other areas that do support the local economy (local shops etc). Woops"

Netflix and Tesla usually spend way more than they make (trade deficit) but that's fine because they will hopefully become something even better than they are now, and people have faith it will happen.There is something to be said for a country's ability to quickly transition to wartime, having a good manufacturing sector and an ability to produce more than you consume helps with that, but from an economic perspective a trade deficit usually just implies that others have faith you will continue to grow quicker than average."

dwsl5h1,RagingOrangutan,"Trump misunderstands two basic things with regard to trade. One is that trade agreements are not zero sum; he seems to think that whenever someone else benefits from a trade deal, we must be losing. Economists are in near unanimous agreement that this is not the case, and that reducing tariffs tends to benefit *both* sides.The other thing he misunderstands is that it makes no sense to look at trade deficits with a single other country. To draw an analogy, let's say you are a home insurance salesman, and you have hair (which is funny because when I think about it, every insurance salesman I know is bald, but I digress.) Every month you get a haircut for $30, but your barber rents his home and thus doesn't buy home insurance from you. Would you go around saying ""we have a bad deal with the barber! We give him $360 a year and he doesn't buy anything from us in exchange! SAD!"" Of course you wouldn't, this is absurd. And it's just as absurd as Trump's approach to trade."

dwskct8,j48u,"I think he's referring to you assuming the US isn't getting fucked in trade with China. Which they most definitely are. Trump and all his bullshit notwithstanding, that part has been true for many years."
dwsl4zk,DonRobo,How are they getting fucked by China? China is providing cheap labor and the US is providing money. That's the purpose of money. Exchanging it for goods and services.Had the US exclusively used their own workers while everyone else started outsourcing their companies would have been extremely uncompetitive and every other developed country's economy would have run circles around them.

We're going to have a deficit with China, that's just the nature of manufacturing all your stuff somewhere else.

dwsr1rh,GhostfaceHecklah,">you don't think they're gonna reverse-engineer everything they build.I don't know mate, the literal underlying agreement of every manufacturing contract _everywhere_. Just because their labor is cheaper doesn't mean it's not a massive issue in the WTO or illegal. You want more for your cheap labor? Negotiate a better contract not literally steal the IP.You realize how insane that sounds? There's no silver platter, there are books written specifically on how to try and protect yourself in China because their government is complicit."
dwsrpp7,Praetorian_Prefect,LOL! US companies are the ones asking for these illegal copies. They send their competitor's products to China and ask them directly to make a cheaper version for them. Everyone is butthurt because the chinese government refuses to recognize international IP's and that's the crux of the problem. Because without the government support private entities have no chance in court. The actual stealing or reproduction of patented technologies happens everywhere on earth and is far from a china only problem.
dwssfp2,GhostfaceHecklah,"LOL! What in the world are you taking about? There are massive amounts of patent and trademark cases going every day, all around the world. This goes on with significant success but not without significant time and effort. Don't act like China isn't THE supreme case for knockoff and black market goods!"

In a few decades China will be the world's most powerful economy, despite the state controlling pretty much most companies. That's a very dangerous situation."

dwu4ivn,wirecats,"What is it about China that trading with them is always a deficit? It's not just Europe and the US. Small African and Asian nations who make deals with China get fucked with debt. And it's not just our time either. I read somewhere that the ancient Romans complained about a trade deficit with China, primarily over expensive Chinese silk products. Why can't anyone seem to be in a surplus when trading with China? And if it always leads to a deficit, why trade with China at all?"
dwuk8lu,sparrowfiend,"The US is one of the only countries that could easily win a trade war. Only 29% of our economy relies on imports. The vast majority of China's does.There's almost nothing that America can't produce domestically, albeit a little bit more expensive than importing it. China on the other hand would collapse. And the EU would also not fare well, either.

dwspgr6,DonRobo,"Oh we definitely consider him crazy, but it's not exactly reflecting on your country as a whole very well when you take him seriously enough that he actually gets to run your country.It's not like this was a completely surprise. Anyone who read or heard anything this man said in the last 10 years knew exactly what you were getting yourself into.We have a saying here ""Jedes Volk hat die Regierung, die es verdient."" which basically translates to ""Every people has the government they deserve"". I don't agree with it in the case of dictatorships, but it absolutely applies to democracies."
dwsw5wr,Savilene,"Trump lost the popular vote and has had like 3 or 4 people in his campaign team hit with ties to Russia in the FBI's investigation into foreign interference with our election.To say that Trump reflects our country or that we deserve him is pretty...wrong. I mean, with the way Mueller's investigation is going, at this rate Trump himself is bound to be placed behind bars before his term as President is up (I hope, at least). Every other week Mueller makes headlines for progress in the case.We've also been flipping congress blue with special elections lately, and have nearly evened out congress, putting democrats in what were traditionally republican states. The elections were close, but the democrats still won. Granted, we still have the midterms to worry about and things can swing back to the Republicans but the country is pretty fed up with Trump and the Republicans as a whole. He's one of the most hated presidents we've ever had"
dwt24gh,DonRobo,"I get you, it must suck to be in the situation the American public is at the moment. I hope you will learn from your mistakes and invest in a better electoral system and much more importantly: educationJudging by /r/the_donald and Twitter (yes, yes, I know) he still has a lot of supporters though which I absolutely cannot understand. They surely can't **all** be Russian bots, right?"
dwtm1fk,RusstyDog,"ya true. and to be honest i'm not surprised that he won, I knew he was going to win once sanders got knocked out of the race. it's just that he is doing worse than I expected. I could handle him making laws and being in charge, but I hate the idea that he actually speaks for us."
dwsxrsw,mckinnon3048,"Except a HUGE portion of our national debt is held by China... And we're essentially devaluing ourselves on purpose.It'd be like getting a mortgage, closing, then telling the bank you quit your job, and asking what their refinancing options are... Our reliability to repay the loan just went to shit, and our likelihood of requesting further funding just went way up."
dwt92gx,AnitaSnarkeysian,"Credit where credit is due, the intellectual property theft from China is actually a serious problem that the Chinese gov't is not addressing. Consider that if you want to start a company, you need to buy computers, and copies of windows, and you need to buy software to run your business on, and you may need to pay royalties to companies to use their brands or images or technology... meanwhile, a Chinese competitor just torrents it all. Now if you want to compete you're thousands of dollars in the hole, which means you need to have higher prices to compensate meaning that they can out-compete you on prices because they stole stuff that you paid for.In the information age, this is really important, but it's been going on for years, and it sure doesn't seem like anyone has even begun to take it seriously.I'm not saying tariffs are the answer, because honestly I have no idea what the answer is; but I am happy to see it at the very least get some lip service."
dwskoft,senpenguin,"Instead of reading Trump's 140 character tweets, educate yourself on the real situation. We are getting fucked, and Redditors are so busy hating Trump they can't see that China's been royally fucking us for decades."
dwskzir,DonRobo,I've educated myself. What the US is saying is completely wrong. They profited immensely from China's cheap labour for decades. China also profited from it. That's what's great about trade. Everyone wins.
dwsmrdh,senpenguin,"No, you haven't. Trade works when both parties cooperate. China has been exporting hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods to the US, while we have been struggling to tap into the exploding Chinese middle class. In order to enter the Chinese market, American corporations need joint ventures with Chinese companies, which is already a huge barrier for any company that does not want to sacrifice autonomy. China has enacted huge tariffs, sided consistently and unfairly with Chinese corporations in patent infringement lawsuits, and performed cyber attacks on ALL US industries (perhaps most concerning is our defense industry). Your armchair philosophy of economics really does a disservice to, well, just about everyone. Edit: and do NOT tell me to cite sources. If you had bothered, at any point in the last several years, to research the issue, you would understand the situation. A simple google of unfair Chinese trade practices will give you a plethora of sources, including Reddit's own Washington Post, detailing how exactly China has been unfair in trade."
dwsqmxk,Praetorian_Prefect,US corporations have been profiting from China's cheap labour since the early 90s so get off your high horse and accept the fact that the tables have turned.
dwsrvyi,senpenguin,"So, to resummarize your enlightening rebuttal - a subset of US companies have profited from decreased costs due to a lack of labor laws in China, so it is okay for China to use excessive tariffs, cyber espionage, and court-supported IP theft. Have you gotten an email from the Olympics? Cause the mental gymnastics you have to perform for your rebuttal to make an inkling of sense is fucking impressive."
dwstrjx,Praetorian_Prefect,> a subset of US companies have profited from decreased costsTalking about mental gymnastics. Nice job downplaying one of the biggest economic and manufacturing boom in US history transforming overnight a secondary industry nation into a tertiary. Stop being so butthurt.
dwsx0ag,senpenguin,"I apologize - my intent with the word “subset” was to state that not all US companies benefitted. Plenty of small businesses, including my parents', were hurt or bankrupt from the competition stemming from unethical labor practices. Regardless, the extent to which the US benefitted from China's lack of labor laws does not justify their practices today. It's a straw man argument."
dwsze4a,Praetorian_Prefect,I never tried to justify what China does though. Just pointing out the hypocrisy when looking at the bigger picture.

dwsmz1u,brightpulse,US definitely getting screwed in trade. Trump may be wrong in how he is doing it. But why he is doing it is justified. The fault squarely lies on China and other countries for exploiting the US policies on trade.
dwsnemc,Byzantine279,"You dont actually know all that much about how trade works, do you? No one is getting screwed by anyone. Not on any grand scale."
dwtk6q5,brightpulse,"I know how trade works and I disagree with you. Trade is not just the raw materials in question here. Aside from the fact that other countries can export to the US at a cheaper tariff than US is charged, there are also technology exports in question. Countries like China put restrictions that the technology needs to to be shared with them to do business there. For example MS has to submit to the regulations, which are ridiculous and dictatorial, to China to do business there. US doesn't have similar restrictions on tech imported from China. Take for example the Android phones loaded with spyware selling in the US. This is one example and we can find many more and at a larger scale. If I am not correct, feel free to explain. Pls don't leave with a snarky remark. Not helpful. Edit: umm I see some of your comments on other posts. You leave short and often snarky remarks, but don't add any argument with weight. I suggest you comment when you can explain yourself. Also take a breath and be nice to those around you. Not everyone is an ignorant idiot"
dwtq3xu,Byzantine279,"My older history is probably gone by now since it only keeps 1,000 posts, but I *did* write long, detail explanations in the past.It never helped. Not once. So you simply aren't worth more than a short comment calling you out.Nothing of what you mentioned is actually relevant to any of this.

dwskwov,gnoxy,"This would be true if America had allies. However with NAFTA being fucked with as well and Europe hating the orange toilet brush as much as Americans, China have markets to trade with that we are losing."
dwszab3,thisistheslowlane,The US economy isn't built on exports. The China economy is. Ya get me? The US is a wealthy country hence why it can afford to have a trade deficit.

dwsh0he,MrEngineerGuy,"China has had much stronger tariffs on the US for a long time. This actually seems to be a win for the Trump administration. American and Chinese products won't stop, they'll just be routed through Australia and South Korea, who have free trade agreements with China and have stronger regulations on product quality anyhow. Edit: For example, US Auto Tariffs have been 2.5% while EU has been 10% and China 25%. This is before the recent ""trade war."""

dwsk33c,Traveledfarwestward,"I respectfully disagree. It is way easier for a Chinese business or businessperson to set up shop and do business in the US than it is for US businesses and businesspeople to get traction in the Chinese market. Combination of hyper nationalism, racism, cultural bias, opaque political corruption and more, no doubt. I strongly support the WTO, but it has hardly been effective at correcting the un-level playing field in China, imho. Other people may have more or better information. Please do correct me, as I've only visited 3-4 times, depending on how you count HK."
dwss0gs,NotClever,"None of that makes tariffs the right option, though."
dwssubi,Traveledfarwestward,I think that makes it the only *Trumpian* option. He and his closest people (professional trade analysts/negotiators excepted) simple don't see any other options that are radical and short-term enough for them.

dwsescw,flyalpha56,"Yea haha, gotta Hand it to those currency manipulating communists. Those Silly bois"
dwsfilf,vanoreo,They did literally the same thing Trump did in response. You cannot be shocked.Tbh it was a pretty capitalistic move.
dwsfo86,flyalpha56,"Our tarrifs are because China has been manipulating their currency against ours for years and because they essentially employ slave labor and have extremely unethical industrial practices that have negative externalities that effect us all such as increased pollution due to no regulations that limit companies in the US. Also China already had tarrifs on many US products. And on top of it all China is notorious for hacking into US supply chains and stealing intellectual property. Our tarrifs were already a retaliation, this is a retaliation to a retaliation."
dwsi3fm,fobfromgermany,We 'manipulate' our currency too. Why is only wrong when China does it?
dwsishz,flyalpha56,We don't intentionally devalue our currency in order to destroy the purchasing power of our people so that labor stays cheap here compared to the rest of the world with the goal of attracting more foreign businesses to build their products here. Do we pin our currency to an exchange rate that does not reflect the market? No. Do we print money to increase the money supply in order to stimulate spending? Yes. Do we do it to intentionally destroy the buying power of our people in order to subvert open market competition and attract foreign business to move here? No. Don't be naive.

dwsgrky,vanoreo,"You could say the exact same thing about almost any country, dude. It's almost like capitalism is a competition."
dwshd1v,iamwhoiamamiwhoami,China hasn't been actually communist since 1978. Deng Xiaopeng put a stop to the communism almost immediately after Mao was gone.
dwsho89,flyalpha56,"Wrong. While the Chinese Communist party had adopted some aspects of capitalism China remains a textbook communist country. The communist party controls all land and “The Commanding Heights of the Economy”. It maintains strict control on speech, assembly, and belief and their political structure is that if a classic Leninist dictatorship."
dwskbjt,iamwhoiamamiwhoami,"> China remains a textbook communist country.You got a lot of Starbucks, McDonalds, GAP and Victoria's Secret shops in your textbook of communism, do you? If you're just going by land ownership and commanding heights of the economy you may as well classify the US as communist, since the government is often tied to every major corporation and eminent domain allows any land to fall under government control."
dwsktsm,flyalpha56,"Haha. The US government cannot kick 1.5 million people out and destroy their homes in order to build a stadium that will be used only 2 weeks for the olympics. The government cannot come and take my land. If they want to build a highway or a rail through a part of my property for the public good so that everyone benefits, sure I'll sell it to them. But they cannot come and take my land. Don't be naive China is a communist country. It's amazing how many people on reddit love to defend communism."
dwsm8yw,iamwhoiamamiwhoami,"> But they cannot come and take my land.I think you need to look up what eminent domain is, because yes they can. If you refuse they'll just give you what your land is supposedly worth."
dwsml3b,flyalpha56,I Think you need to look up what it is. I define it pretty well in my comment above. It can only be used for a public good such as infrastructure or defense. Kicking 1.5 million people out of their homes to build a stadium for 1 event is not a use of eminent domain. That would not fly in the US. China owns all land and leases it to the citizens. They can take land without just compensation. That is in no way the same thing as eminent domain.
dwso00h,iamwhoiamamiwhoami,"> That would not fly in the US.It was literally proposed in Boston for building; yup you guessed it, an Olympic stadium. Again, I think you need to do a little eminent domain reading. Perhaps start [somewhere fairly obvious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelo_v._City_of_New_London). Homes have been seized for golf courses, parking lots, and even a car dealership, so this notion you have that it can only be for infrastructure or defense is pretty laughable. So, is the US communist too, because that's what this was all about?"
dwso4wg,flyalpha56,You've missed the point entirely. No chinese citizen can own land. They lease it from the communist party. The land can be taken with no compensation. Do you get it now?
dwsofsz,iamwhoiamamiwhoami,"Yes, and the US government can do the same, which is my point. If that's all there is to communism, then everyone is Communist."
dwsoipp,flyalpha56,No the us government cannot take land without compensation. It is not the same at all. And i also never said “that's all there is to communism” infact i listed like 5 other things about how China is still a textbook example of a communist state.

Like, they just gloss over the fact that news is completely censored in China. Do people even remember Tibet?"
dwsfc09,EnricoShang,"Yes, I remember when Tibet used to be a feudal state ruled by the monks, who imposed extremely high tributes on the peasant and in which slaves used to be legal before the Chinese came.Edit: a word"
dwsfk25,oGsBumder,"If China had dismantled the feudal system and then let Tibet democratically choose its own path then no-one would have any problem with it. The problem is that they didnt do that, they invaded and forcibly annexed Tibet and have spent the following decades doing their best to suppress and dismantle the local culture. Literally 90% (not exaggerating) of Tibetan Buddhist temples were destroyed, many of them of huge historical and cultural value, and Tibetans are denied democracy and basic human rights and religious freedoms."
dwt3hjz,fractokf,"If America had dismantled Saddam Hussein's dictatorships then let Iraq democratically choose its own path then no one would have any problem with it...But U.S. had to have a government that won't rise against their interest. To be fair, if U.S. didn't set up a pro-US government, other countries in the region will attempt to influence the region regardless. If China didn't do what they did, India or other players in the region would've tried to influence the process regardless. A similar percentage (no specific data) of Han Ethnic building were destroyed under CCP rules. Any claim that CCP conducted cultural ethnic cleansing is frankly seeing things through a tiny scope. The destruction from CCP is on all culture and all 56 unique indigenous nation. In fact all of this nations, including the majority of Han ethnic are also denied democracy, basic human right and religious freedom. This is not justify the oppression, however Pro-Tibetan group has been trying to twist the root of the issue to racial tension rather than the political system. From China's stand point, they inherited the territory of RoC, which inherited the territory of Qing Dynasty."
dwsfyu1,EnricoShang,"Well, do you think the supporters of the feudal system would have just let go? Now...I think that it's important to consider that the local culture played an important role in mantaining the Lama's oppressive regime (the whole seeing him as the reicarnation of Buddha and stuff like that). Yeah, destroying temples might not be the way to go, but I personally think that letting this cult of the Dalai Lama be isn't the way either. While today he is seen by some as a symbol of peace, I think we should remember the system he stands for."
dwsg421,mithie007,"China is imperialist. They toppled the feudal system because the oppressed han minority Tibetan revolutionaries were fed up with the theocracy, but once the Chinese army had boots on the ground, they decided they needed to recoup the cost of occupation somehow, so they installed their own government and purged the remnants of the theocracy, replacing it with a brand of state socialism headed up by local puppets while pretending to give Tibet autonomy.This is typical imperialist strategy."
dwskxsj,ShrimpCrackers,That was more than 70 years ago. Even China has improved since 70 years ago. How do you know Tibet wouldn't have? The exile government is actually a **direct democracy** that Tibetans have to pay for.
dwsoejn,EnricoShang,"Funds for the ""Tibetan government in Exile"" come mostly from private donations and funding by governments like India and US...those two are historical rivals of China. The whole financial side of that organization is shady af."
dwsglgx,popolopopo,"are you trying to say tibet is better off now?you know not hearing a thing about tibet due to chinese news suppression doesnt equal tibet having no problems right? i'd argue having a media blackout of the situation is far more frightening. i did human rights and refugee work in china for years, if you think the chinese are somehow against slavery, jesus christ i'm getting seriously upset about just how true my original post is. i've never seen so much slavery and no one will ever know about it and people will actually defend china as some bastion of anti-slavery like you do. i'm gonna go outside and take a walk before i have a meltdown."
dwsgrdt,EnricoShang,"The start of ""slavery"" in China started after Deng Xiaoping opened up to foreign markets and passed laws that were favourable to foreign investors, but fucked over the workers. This happened in the 1990s, while Tibet was liberated in 1950. Completely different eras for China."
dwshxqb,dsent001,You are so right. It is common knowledge that China was leading the world in quality of life during the cultural revolution. Bigly.
dwsiaxx,EnricoShang,"You know, when you literally start off as a country ravaged by half a century of wars and have to rebuild everything by yourself you are going to have at least a few problems."
dwsj4d9,puabie,Mass famines and human suffering on untold levels is not a prerequisite for rebuilding a country. Your comment is the understatement of the millennium.
dwsjdxa,EnricoShang,Cultural Revolution had nothing to do with the famines that happened in the late 50s due to bad agricultural policies and difficult climate. You're going off track here.
dwsjq6o,puabie,"Famines happened concurrently with the Cultural Revolution. Food scarcity is one of the defining features of postwar China, and we cannot isolate individual policies from it. The broader picture is one of terrible misgovernment, poor leadership and oppressive regime. Deng Xiaoping did a decent job steering China toward a freer market, which in turn improved the scarcity situation, but much of China still struggles to feed itself."
dwslycw,EnricoShang,"The great famine happened from 1958 to 1961. Deng Xiaoping's reform only benefited a small part of the population, but most of all foreign investors. All he did with the introduction of free market was opening the doors to the exploitation of his people to foreign corporations, who now use China for its cheap labor. I have parents and relatives who have lived in China through decades spanning from the late 40s to the mid 80s, here's a couple of things:•My family was of noble descent, some kind of land owning nobility. By the time of the revolution my great grandfather had already sold almost all of his land and was mostly a painter at this point. He went through a trial, accused of exploiting the people, but he was found innocent and let go of. This shows how justice was not as summary and one sided as you would think it was, and that very probably the people convicted for such crimes weren't really innocent saints and martyrs as you are made believe.•I have never heard tales of scarcity coming from those who lived through the late 60s and 70s and beyond. My father describes China during the 70s as ""kinda poor"", but he says that there was always food on the table and rations aside, people went shopping for food everyday.Edit: words"

dwsof0p,andthendirksaid,"It's more that you agree so you don't think he is. I wouldn't have used the same terminology but maybe combative, confrontational or simply ‘rude'. There's no real reason for half an answer to asking for sources needed to be made halfway up of a longer version of “you could've just used google yourself”. Then rather than leave it at that bit of passive aggression, the short and dismissive ending assuming that they wouldn't accept proof and not so subtle assumptions and jab at perceived political affiliations that had no basis of their own made for a pretty unnecessary sense of trying to admonish the OP with providing sources as simply the conduit. To be honest it reads like a self righteous seizure of an opportunity to reprimand at best and truthfully I kept getting the sense that it was a performance of sorts almost like a monologue and ‘mete out justice' for the approval of an audience. It had a feeling like there would soon come a pause to allow for a round of applause or that the ultimate goal was to have someone else screenshot the exchange and post it to some like minded subreddit and have it titled “user who questioned the US' track record of bombing schools DESTROYED by redditor with sources, resigns from life”."

dwsita0,rememberdan13,I'd love a response. Spoken like a true school yard bully. You are totally correct that collateral damage is a horrific part of war and totally happens. War is ugly. But you dont know anything about it if you werent there. And im sorta surprised you would stick your flag in the ground and claim that anything posted on the internet is 100 percent factual. Since you posted this I will assume you weren't there in Iraq when al queda planted IEDs in towns and roads then detonated them killing civilians unceremoniously. There were on average 2 suicide bombings per day in large civilian areas that killed dozens of people and that was just in Fallujah where I was. Those numbers are a part of Iraqbodycount. In fact they count every death remotely associated and blame American troops. It's easy to vilify our country and I don't know if you are from here or not but stop helping other governments divide us. Stop looking at things through socialist colored glasses. We shouldn't have been in iraq in my opinion but while we were there we focused on saving civilians and killing terrorists that had just attacked our country. Sorry I needed this record straight for anyone who read your post.
dwsk35s,NotAnFed,"1) I'd love a response!2) I know plenty about it and I wasn't there. You don't know everything about it, and you (maybe?) were there. Grunts ain't Generals.3) I literally said in my post you shouldn't trust everything you see through google and that you should double-check sources4) I wasn't in Iraq, and Iraqi terrorists killed what.. 50x? 100x more civilians that US forces did? That's not the issue I was protesting against. Also, was the rate of suicide bombings targeting Fallujah citizens more or less than when occupying US forces arrived? I'm not sure on that number, get back to me (its generally less).5) You can dispute whether or not Iraqbodycount has innacurate numbers, but I haven't seen any other reputable sources saying otherwise. In fact, I'd venture to guess since the vast majority of those deaths were confirmed on a case by case basis by the US compensation records that that listed number of 1200 is LOW. We don't exactly like to say when we kill civilians. Oh shit, was that guy 14-35 and male? Yeah, definitely not a civilian.6) I'm 'from here'. Austin, Texas. I'm not dividing anybody, just callin' it as I and many news organisations sees it. Socialist covered glasses, woah yah big bully.7) I'm glad (you?) were focused on keeping civilians safe and killing terrorists during (your?) tour.

dwsqfb1,Dr9,"No sane person wants children to die. Civilian casualties are unfortunate, but historically those are super low for any conflict.It doesn't help that our enemies are cowards who hide behind children.http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4338508/Child-suicide-bomber-caught-Hazard-Chelsea-kit.html"
dwteo1p,DacMon,You can't bomb the hate out of that population. You'll just breed more hate.
dwst0ty,bodmodman333,"And there goes that arguement. ""Well... we dont murder and rape as many children as they did in past wars."" Oh! Awesome, we arent as bad as people like hitler, stalin, or Ghengis Khan, so its justified."
dwsxpn1,Dr9,"We don't purposefully commit to 'total war' on civilians, or hide behind kids. So yeah, we are better than our enemies."
dwt30ra,bodmodman333,We are no better than our enemies. We are just more secretive.
dwsv5kh,Lurkenstein2017,Ok so... casualties of war?
dwsi2qx,Obi_Kwiet,Of course there are going to be civilian casualties in a guerilla war. If you want to see what it was like when we didn't care about civilian casualties check out the Vietnam war.
dwsizd5,NotAnFed,"Damn man I didn't know the Iraq and Syrian war was so progressive, you're blowing my mind right now"
dwsjtow,Obi_Kwiet,"I didn't say it was progressive. I don't think that's a coherent adjective to apply to a war. My point that US's efforts to avoid civilian causalities has reduced the number of those casualties by several orders of magnitude compared to the last time it engaged in that kind of warfare. Sitting around grousing that the number of casualties should be arbitrarily lower is just pointless blithering. You might argue that we shouldn't be over there in the first place, but that's not the argument you are making."
dwskhc0,NotAnFed,I would make that argument if I had the liquor available
dwsklza,Obi_Kwiet,Probably not worth the effort.
dwsii5i,RepublicOfREEEEEEEEE,"I know for a fact because I lived through the time when America didn't give a shit about children dying because they were “children of the corn type robots being indoctrinated by a hate preacher” (as a stranger I once talked to put it) in a cult in Waco, Texas. Why would you think America would act any more sympathetically to what could very well have been a madras teaching children to hate and murder westerners?War is hell. We should avoid it at all costs. Pretending it's useful to compare these two is like comparing the concentration camps in Germany vs the camps in allied countries during WWII. Everyone did the same horrible things it just existed on a spectrum... on the less brutal side people were worked hard but not tortured... on the more brutal side people where tortured and exterminated in cruel and unusual ways. But EVERYONE DID IT and that's something we have to deal with. Politics today seems to be about virtue signaling who is less evil because we've all realized because of the internet that we're all pretty shitty."
dwsj5no,NotAnFed,You keep using past-tense words when we're literally still in Syria
dwsjj23,RepublicOfREEEEEEEEE,"My example was in the past tense so my words were. That's how words work. Learn it before you engage in a communications medium based on language.You know what still happens all over Africa? SlaveryYou know what still happens all over the Middle East and Asia? Female genital mutilationPeople who act like America is the great Satan and yet are American and living off the benefits of being American and NOT being in a place that is objectively worse off are stupid. If you think the world will automatically improve, slavery will disappear in Africa, communism will disappear in Central America and FGM will dry up in the Middle East if we remove America you might have had a lobotomy or might be the perfect poster child for a minimum IQ to vote because that's an insane position."
dwsk9oc,NotAnFed,"I criticize America because I hold it to a higher standard. That's called being a patriot ya fuck""People who act like America is the great Satan and yet are American and living off the benefits of being American and NOT being in a place that is objectively worse off are stupid."" FUUUUCK you're so close man! You're so fucking close! Why are most other places objectively worse off, and why are we able to live off the benefits of their labor without aknowledgement?"
dwsyohb,RepublicOfREEEEEEEEE,"Fuck that shit. I know what you're thinking and you're dead wrong. We have healthy trade relationships and unhealthy ones. There are countries that take advantage of us. People who make it sound like Americans do none of the work and live off the work of the worlds “oppressed” but call themselves patriots are hypocrites. Less than 60 years ago the labor force was MOSTLY American, products were mostly Americans and outsourcing was a laughable idea because we did the work just fine and better than anyone else. People who right out of the gate assume we can never get back to that are lazy and insane."
dwtekmn,Peace35,yep. the definition of a school. Is a madras teaching radical islam to suicide bombers the same as teaching math and science?
dwseikw,PsychoticMormon,"Just 3 seconds of research found [this one from last year](https://theintercept.com/2017/09/25/syria-us-airstrike-civilian-death-hrw-tabqa/) and another 2 seconds [found this article](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/08/america-is-bombing-the-hell-out-of-syrian-civilians/) which says up to 12 schools, including a primary and a girls highschool, as part of a larger strategy by the US."
dwsg67h,RandyHoward,"Hmm does the ""larger strategy"" mean ""kill all the children so they can't grow up and seek revenge""?"
dwsifoo,0xD153A53,"That would be effective if that was the strategy. Instead, they're not trying to kill *all* the children. If you do that, who will fight future wars to keep the American military industrial complex hard at work?"
dwsgv6k,,[deleted]
dwsgydf,GreetingsStarfighter,Pretty sure the last administration dropped a record number of bombs. But those Republicans.
dwsj2ff,Amiable_,"Let's say you're a centrist, and you've managed to become president. Turns out compromise is a necessary step if you want two polarized parties to come together and actually get anything done. The left says ""save the environment!"" the right says ""we need more safety!"" so you design your legislation to have enough left-leaning things and enough right-leaning things in order to get it to pass. Now, because this is how the legislative branch works, the house and the senate start tacking on earmarks, adding in favors for certain members who are less likely to vote yes, etc, and you end up with most bills that manage to pass having lots and lots of things in them which the original did not. Now imagine that it's time to pass the yearly budget bill through. Time to decide which departments get more/less money from the federal government. But unfortunately, one side has a majority in either the house or senate, and says it refuses to pass the budget unless certain demands are met; demands asking for either significant, and even detrimental, pushes either further left or further right. So you try to talk to them, try to reason with them, and then the time limit for the passing of the budget runs out, and you have to temporarily shut down the government; you can't pay anyone. Eventually, you just have to say 'fine, we give in', because as a centrist it's more important that the government is operating at all. Remember all those earmarks? Remember the [demands of the single party threatening to stall the budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_shutdown_of_2013)? Those are Republican politicians making those earmarks and demands. 'Obama' ends up signing in significant additional funding for the military in an attempt to compromise with the demands of Republican legislators, but his 'administration' is certainly not to blame for the impetus to do so."
dwsp834,Exmerman,This. I don't know why so many Americans think the executive branch makes all the decisions and rules.
dwt3ntf,smegma_legs,because people who don't actually care about politics beyond personal identity have trouble reading issues past figureheads
dwsjrac,GreetingsStarfighter,"His administration isn't responsible for the bombing? Only Republicans? None of the Democrats that voted for any of the wars we actually voted on? And only Republicans for the ones we didn't? Also, wasn't and isn't it a Republican complaint that Obama cut spending to the military? Wasn't there multiple talks about not having proper equipment and things falling into disrepair?Both sides play obstruction. You can watch the opposite playing out right now if you're not old enough to remember Bush. Doesn't matter, my point was and remains, both sides bomb the shit out of whatever they feel like. Both sides love war. Both sides benefit greatly from it. People excuse their team from it. Which is why I was responding to the original comment.To think they aren't responsible is naive imo."
dwsk4ge,Amiable_,"I think the 'both sides are the same' argument is a little oversimplified, is all. I'm not going to say that there are no warhawks in the Democratic party * cough *CLINTON*. I also realize that complaining about under-funding the military is the best way to get more funding for it when the administration is looking for compromise. I also realize that the Obama administration is not the same thing as the military itself, and that taking foreign action against ISIS makes Republicans happy. For sure, no one side is to blame entirely, but blaming the bombing on Obama is just ignoring the finer points of the issue."
dwskgvc,Doctorslim,But not putting any blame on Obama is doing the samething.
dwskmpe,Amiable_,"I never said Obama deserves none of the blame. He still signed the shit, and was Commander in Chief, and therefore probably gave some of the orders to carry out said questionable military acts. But my argument is that he did it for the sake of compromise, whether or not that was reason enough, and not out of the desire to bomb Syria. We can't honestly know, but that's how it seems to me at least."
dwstxeg,CrimsonNova,"> he did it for the sake of compromise""Welp, the Republicans are whining again, better go bomb some children to make em happy!""Obama not doing enough is what got us in the mess we currently have goddamnit. I loved him as a president, because I wasn't kept awake at night wondering what part of the constitution he was gonna shit on next, but he was a half-measured half-assed fucker."
dwsu7k5,Amiable_,"Total government shutdown is not equivalent to 'Republicans whining'. You do realize that one of the central pillars of modern conservative thought is that 'small government = better'? It's not hard to see the link between a Democratic president, the government actively shutting down, and Republicans going ""See, big government doesn't work!"" while actively causing the shutdown. Essentially, the Republicans had no incentive to get the government up and running without a compromise, so we would have been at a standstill for who knows how long if Obama had been tougher."
dwsv8ct,CrimsonNova,"> who knows how long if Obama had been tougher.We'll never know because he wasn't. That's the bur under the goddamn saddle man. He refused to step down to their level. Sure, he won a moral victory, but what did that get us? Not a fuckin thing."
dwsvkfw,Amiable_,"You realize that they waited two weeks before conceding, and during this time they negotiated, right? It also wasn't just Obama, it was the entire legislature too. It's not like the legislature had all agreed on something, and Obama refused to sign it..."
dwswg4q,CrimsonNova,"Sure, but this specific instance was far from the only thing Obama didn't do to properly preserve our democracy knowing the things he did.But honestly man, I need somewhere to direct my anger, and this is a good temporary outlet. Thinking about Trump might literally drive me to kill someone eventually. Gotta use up that nervous energy!"
dwsl2qm,Doctorslim,"Fair enough. Just the way you ended it by saying ""... blaming Obama..."" kinda implies placing any blame at all. I agree otherwise though"
dwskuzf,Hotal,"You have a lot of points - but the blame for the number of bombs dropped during an administration can be laid directly on the president. Presidents get a lot of crap they don't deserve for the amount of power they actually have, but the military is one area where they have plenty of power. He's the commander in chief. If he doesn't want bombs dropped, he can make that happen."
dwsl1vi,Amiable_,"Sure, Obama probably could have sent out a 'do not bomb' order. And then Fox News blows up about 'OBAMA WANTS TO STOP BOMBING ISIS, BECAUSE HE'S A MUSLIM', and the Republicans start throwing a shit storm, and any potential progress you've made with them in terms of compromise is, well, compromised. I'm not making the argument that he didn't give the orders, I'm saying his boner for compromise is the reason behind it. Was that boner justified? Maybe not, and we can have a discussion about that. But to ignore the politics of the situation is to be ignorant of the situation."
dwsmzp4,otabagel,"Is it bombs or drone strikes? Because it's also the first administration where the drone tech has really taken off... it's kinda like saying we have more gun deaths from semiautomatic weapons today compared to 200 years ago. Accurate, but not a useful stat"
dwsn8cs,ichatchase,I didn't know that supporting a politician or administration requires wholeheartedly supporting everything they do.
dwt1cxn,GreetingsStarfighter,Didn't say that. Pretty sure my point was that it's not one sided.
dwstgv5,niknarcotic,Considering Trump inflated the military budget even more he thought he needs to break that highscore. Really glad to have such an upstanding country with both parties being jingoist maniacs as the defender of the free world.
dwsndel,TheHammerHasLanded,Bold claim. Gots any of them facts to back this up?
dwt18rz,GreetingsStarfighter,"Thought it was pretty common knowledge that we were bombing the shit out of everything. It's not going to get better, but that wasn't my point. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-president-barack-obama-bomb-map-drone-wars-strikes-20000-pakistan-middle-east-afghanistan-a7534851.html%3famp#ampshare=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-president-barack-obama-bomb-map-drone-wars-strikes-20000-pakistan-middle-east-afghanistan-a7534851.html"
dwtsmz4,TheHammerHasLanded,"Yeah, your point was the previous administration set the record for strikes, which is what I was looking for clarification on. While true, he seriously cut the amount of soldiers fighting over there by using drones. The fight doesn't miraculously stop, and his decisions saved American soldiers from having to risk, or even sacrifice, their lives."
dwuqh71,GreetingsStarfighter,"You know how else you save American Soldier's lives? Not sending them into illegal wars in the first place. I love that so many people have come out of the wood work to defend their team though. When if I was saying this about just Republicans, everyone here would nod and agree. It's not a justifiable thing. No matter the team."

dwsu7qr,PsychoticMormon,"> Also since I'm interested do you have a source for the US bombing schools specifically?Question I was answering. I don't care for the ""whaddabout"" arguments."
dwshif9,lawADCin2k17,You do realize China is a third world country don't You? The majority of its citizens are very poor.
dwsimbj,KarbonKevin,"The terms of First, Second, and Third World are outdated (Cold War era) and actually refer towards the political alignment of a nation more than anything; First World nations were the US and her allies, the Second World are the Soviet bloc, and the Third World were aligned with neither. Despite the majority of China's citizens being poor, China is considered a Developing Nation by most metrics regardless."
dwsrf4l,InfanticideAquifer,"That is the *origin* of the terms, but they have evolved over time. Nowadays ""first world"" mean ""developed"", ""third world"" means ""developing"", and ""second world"" doesn't get used."
dwsvdjz,KarbonKevin,"You're on track but not quite there; The **First**, **Second**, and **Third** World terms are specifically *political* in nature. **Developed**, **Developing**, and **Least Developed** are in regards to *economic growth*. The Three Worlds terminology came about and (should have) died with the Cold War due to the specific political definitions they carried.“Third World = poor” is a stereotype more than anything. This stereotype came about due to these nations that did not align themselves with either the Western or Soviet bloc being generally poor.The two tend to correlate, but are not exclusively indicative. For examples, Mexico, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia fell within the Third World definition, but by no means are poor or “least developed”.China was also actually considered a Second World Country due to being allied with the USSR during the Cold War, not a Third World Country."
dwt9vj7,InfanticideAquifer,"No, I'm there. What I described is actually how those terms are used by people today. You are (repeatedly, now) describing how those terms were *formerly* used. (And how they're still used when talking about the Cold War.)If you want proof, [here's the definition from Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/third%20world). My usage is the first listed. Yours is the second. [Here's exactly the same thing from dictionary.com](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/third-world). [Here's the same definition from the Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/third-world). [Here's Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Third_World).You're just *not right*. Can you handle that? Or are you going to respond to criticism with a second snarky comment that literally just repeats your original point without actually addressing anything that I said?"
dwtdxyg,KarbonKevin,"No snark, patronizing, or any other negativity was intended, apologies. My point was to *reemphasize* the Cold War origins and context, and point once again to the new terms that fit the economic context more. Interesting write up on NPR about the terminology, which covers the topic better than I can undoubtedly:https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/01/04/372684438/if-you-shouldnt-call-it-the-third-world-what-should-you-call-itI'm not disputing that the “Third World” commonly refers to the less developed nations of the world, depending on who you ask, but if you look on the International Statistical Institute for instance, such terms are considered to be outdated."
dwtfa8m,InfanticideAquifer,">I'm not disputing that the “Third World” commonly refers to the less developed nations of the worldI really don't see how you can possibly say that, when your first comment ITT was a response to someone who used the term ""third world"" that way. And that response consisted of a (overly narrow) definition of the term ""third world"" and the suggestion of a replacement. If that comment *isn't* disputing their use of the term then what *is* it doing? How can you justify that comment as having any other purpose?"
dwsjy0h,shanenanigans1,"That doesn't address the part where most of their citizens are dirt poor. Who cares what you call them? Lol, are you people seriously angry about arbitrary terminology? What part of 'president for life' is developing? What part of 'do not question the CCP' is developing? What part of 'social scoring' is developing? The US and the first world have their problems, sure. But none are as authoritarian as China. Save for Russia, but I don't consider them a developed nation either."
dwskm9i,KarbonKevin,"Just because most of their citizens are poor, does not change that they are considered a Developing Country. China's overall economic status actually puts it in the high end of the Developing Country categories (Newly Industrialized Country).Also using the First, Second, and Third worlds terminology is just incorrect now since the definitions involve the existence of the Soviet Bloc, and do not refer to the economic status of any country. The “Third World” being poor is simply a stereotype."
dwskxmb,shanenanigans1,"Again, I don't really care what some people want to call it. The fact is, their gov is oppressive, their citizens have no rights and are dirt poor for the most part."

dwslrfn,crouching_tiger,Hahah not sure the point that guy is trying to make
dwsw9eg,KarbonKevin,"Going to be completely honest, it is just pedantry. https://www.isi-web.org/index.php/resources/developing-countriesI'm not disagreeing with what he says about the current state of China's citizens however, but this and that aren't as closely tied as one would think."
dwsms5q,Iamchinesedotcom,The correct term is nong min.
dwsomt8,looeee,"Personally, I would choose something that makes me seem less prejudiced. Developing country is good, you could use that in future."
dwsr2k9,shanenanigans1,"Prejudice doesn't play a part. I'm simply describing their situation. They are not developing. The gov is consolidating absolute power, revoking citizen rights. That's not developing."
dwsrlo4,looeee,"Oh, I didn't realise you were an expert on Chinese economics and social politics. I thought you were just some guy who's read a couple of (Western) media articles, formed a knee-jerk reaction and was now inexplicably defending their ignorance. My apologies."
dwsrxy5,shanenanigans1,"If you have to resort to snark you don't have an argument. Chinese media is literally not allowed to criticize the CCP..... I work with a lot of chinese nationals. Most of the Chinese population is dirt poor. Fact. Political dissent is not allowed in China. Fact.Journalists who criticize Xi are black bagged. Fact.Xi just removed term limits for himself, which is something only dicatators do. Fact. I never claimed to be an expert, so don't make dumb strawmen. I'm just laying out some simple facts that indicate China is not a developing nation. Their economy is growing, sure. But socially they're extremely oppressive. Screaming ""you're western"" is not an argument. Neither is snark."

dwsg7z4,Petro655321,"Wow calm down. It's relevant because our “relative freedom” is pretty much an illusion. They are ruled by one party, and we are ruled by a 1% that would love to make us look more like China."
dwsh6ed,Ozhav,"Cool down with the foil hat man. The two parties are not good, and while one is better than the other American democracy is at stake due to the influence of the 1% which has their best interests in mind - which in many cases is exceptional with freedom. But American relative democracy is not an illusion. It is, relative to China, so much better. I guarantee you, you can not get away with things Americans can do on a daily basis. You must be grateful for that and recognize the immense freedom you Americans have relative to the 1.4bn in China. I'm not saying the US is a liberty Utopia, because it's not, and there is a lot wrong with it. But denying this relative freedom is absolutely false. Especially when considering this is on relatavistic terms."
dwshxm6,HappyGirl252,"I can't read any more comments in this thread because I literally don't have time, but I wanted to acknowledge real quick what you're saying. I get what the other guy was saying and I absolutely *also* get what you're saying. You are both right. The whole world is fucked, it's just that a lot of Americans are finally “awake” enough to see that we are just as bad as some other parts of the world and that trite saying “freedom isn't free” is actually true (side note: duh.) Not saying this is the case for the guy above, but some people need some time to adjust to what (to them) is a brand new perspective of their homeland. But I absolutely agree with you that, compared to China, a person would be moronic to “choose” China over America in some weird “well at least *they*” style justification. America is a red-hot burning dumpster fire...but it's still much easier to live in America than most of the rest of the world at large.

I mean I'm in private health insurance and once you get there they'll treat you like a king, which has negative sides to it such as them advising you to cut every other “potentially” bad mole out ($$$), but you got EVERYTHING covered from proper private nursing to tooth implants up to semi- plastic surgeries ..."

dwsfgbq,limukala,"Says someone who has never had to receive care in China. The service is so uneven that you don't want to call 119 even if you're in a car accident, you instead are better off calling a private hospital directly and waiting longer for the ambulance."
dwsfod9,camellyc3,119 is fire emergency... you must have been to China.
dwsfyr3,limukala,"It's been a few years, and as I said I never called it. We had the number of a private hospital to call. This policy was put in place after several nightmares with rolling the dice on public hospitals."
dwsih2r,camellyc3,"I'm genuinely interested. Would you mind telling me which city were you in back then? Private hospitals in China generally have very bad reputation and poor conditions, while public ones are better, at least in big cities. I actually never went to private hospitals. There were several scandals about private hospitals not long ago."
dwsjygv,limukala,"Beijing. And I guess I should differentiate between “private” hospitals, and specifically “international hospitals”. The latter are where you can expect a Western standard of care. DoD and State Dept. contract through one of them to provide emergency medical services, again in response to some horrifically poor care. Public hospital ambulances don't really have much in the way of advanced life-saving equipment that you'd find even in a shitty rural US hospital, etc."

dwsfiyu,FivePoopMacaroni,[Not in the form we see in most developed countries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_China) The quality of their healthcare varies wildly by region.

dwsfqgx,bigwangbowski,"Uh I don't even have to read your link to say that it isn't true. Health care in China is pay to play, same as in the US. It's just not as expensive, is all."
dwshx2t,,Free isn't the word you're looking for.
dwskqbg,ShrimpCrackers,"That list's definition of Free Health Care **is not actually free** **as in 'no money'.**\> **Free Health care:** Free health care refers to a publicly funded health care that provides primary services free of charge or a** nominal fee to all its citizen**s with no exclusions based on income or wealth.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care#cite_note-3)Not only have I **been to China** many times but also many other nations \(most of Europe, all of East Asia\) that it lists as ""free too"", there that simply do not have free health care even though they're listed as such. You do have to pay."
dwsn6v4,DreamCatcher24,You realize people know this right? The term free refers to you just going to the clinic and not having an enormous bill afterwards. You're not going bankrupt like people do here to receive healthcare.

China actually has [free universal health care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care)The problem with that response is, it doesn't actually mean China has superior healthcare and schools and free universal healthcare doesn't necessarily mean very inexpensive or even good care.Whenever a Japanese person gets very sick in China they don't stay, they run back to Japan. Whenever a Taiwanese person gets very sick in China, they don't stay, they run back to Taiwan. This is because these all have 'free universal healthcare' but it doesn't mean China's is any good on an average level."
dwsl4ca,sakmaidic,"The term ""free"" is loosely used to describe ""government funded health care program"". It's never free in any country, here in Canada although we claim to have ""free universal health"", I still see thousands of dollars been deducted from my tax return every year for the provincial health program. China has a co-pay health insurance program where the government pays a big chunk of the cost. I know this because I travel to China for work multiple times every year and I know the locals only pay like 20% of their hospital bill. They also have allowances they can use towards drugs, which are mostly cheaper compare to most western countries."

Chinese government arrest people who speak the Truth. 趙連海 is arrested because he raised awareness on food safety and he is just one of the case. Many people were arrested because they are fighting for rights. Onlydumb people will believe the propaganda that they get money from other countries to destabilize China. Who would risk everything to rebel against an authoritative government for mere money.Even when things are not political the Chinese government still tends to keep everything under absolute control. My mother often go on voluntary medical service trip to Guizhou and the official is very unfriendly and always make trouble with them.

dwshywd,Mikeisright,"Whenever I see antifa throwing rocks at cops, and swinging bike locks at peaceful rallies, I think to myself, ""Wow, now THAT guy seems like a stable and kind individual!"""
dwsfgze,jaspersgroove,"Ah, so it's named after how Trump behaved when Obama was elected?"
dwsg69d,ZombieTesticle,"That was for PR purposes. You absolutely had some ""Obama derangement"" going on earlier in his presidency, though. The episode where using the wrong brand of mustard became *the* talking point of talk radio for the week comes to mind.It's just plain polarization and neither side is immune. Social media and search engine tailoring makes possible ever worse and worse polarization as people self-select into their own little in-groups where they can't tolerate other opinions than their own. The new rabid left now is *much* worse than the conservatives were under Obama. Likewise, I expect the conservatives to be *much* worse than the rabid left now is once a democrat wins the presidential election.This demonization of ""the other"" is rapidly going to get us all into trouble and present a very real threat to democracy unless we learn to manage social media and the ability to manipulate us in aggregate."
dwsfvmc,dweezil22,"You're completely wrong. [In the US, the right is ideology based with no consistent values or principals other than to support Trump. The rest of the country actually has stayed quite consistent.](https://np.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/760jtn/ooof_trump/doafykp/?sh=a7423449&st=J8PCXU38) Sure, you can cherry pick a small group of lunatics, or people that have become effectively unhinged by Trump. But the fact is that he's simultaneously historically incompetent, historically corrupt, and quite malicious to the average American's interests. Trump is so awful it's become virtually impossible to distinguish ideological opposition from principled thoughtful opposition. One of the best example of this is Adam Davidson, who spent his entire career being basically apolitical running an econ podcast, [only to become an incredibly outspoken Trump opponent.](https://twitter.com/adamdavidson?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). To paraphrase, intelligence and decency have an anti-Trump bias."
dwsnrl5,heterosapian,"[""All Americans, not only in the States most heavily affected but in every place in this country, are rightly disturbed by the large numbers of illegal aliens entering our country. The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers. That's why our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens. In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. We are a nation of immigrants. But we are also a nation of laws. It is wrong and ultimately self-defeating for a nation of immigrants to permit the kind of abuse of our immigration laws we have seen in recent years, and we must do more to stop it.""](https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4631739/bill-clinton-illegal-immigration)That was Bill Clinton in his 1995 State of the Union Address. I'm sure you will go on thinking that Democrats haven't changed their agenda from away reasonable policy into moonbat territory but it's demonstrably false. Clinton's speech was not particularly controversial in 1995 - now there's a large group of young Americans who want completely open borders and amnesty for all illegals and see Republican voters as racist bigots for wanting our border laws enforced. By current progressive standards, I'm sure Bill wouldn't have a chance to even win the Democratic primary nomination so it's downright hilarious that his wife did... and in doing so needed to repudiate her mutual history with her husband on immigration, crime, supporting NAFTA and the TPP, gay marriage, and the Iraq war."
dwso31q,dweezil22,"Some folks support open borders, that's not moonbat territory, that's just history progressing. Supporting gay marriage was virtually unthinkable on the national stage in 1995, and the EU didn't exist (i.e. there was no POC of an open border policy working reasonably well). However, I'm not granting that an open border in the US are a mainstream liberal position. It simply isn't. DACA != open borders."
dwspasg,heterosapian,I never said anything about DACA - I said young people are most receptive to open border policies. If DACA was proposed in 95' you would have Democrats pushing back. Both of those are indicative of change - that the Democrats in the Senate today are more open to illegal immigrants and that future Democrats are likely going to be even more open.The EU is nothing at all like the border between the US and Mexico. There is very few reasons to stay in Mexico if there's an open border policy - the quality of life is so shitty in comparison. We would have literally tens of millions of immigrants flooding into the county from South America every year.
dwshhi4,ZombieTesticle,"> Sure, you can cherry pick a small group of lunatics, or people that have become effectively unhinged by TrumpThose were exactly the people I was talking about, yes. What are *you* talking about? you seem to be rebutting points I didn't make."
dwshs70,dweezil22,"Percentage wise, I'm talking about <1% of the US population. I was assuming you were talking about significantly more than that. As you said: > Which tells you just how much of the opposition to Trump is based in ideology and how much is based in a manufactured reverse cult of personality.This seems to discuss the blanket opposition to Trump, most of which is not unhinged. If I assumed incorrectly and you were referring to a small minority, my apologies, I agree with your point. That said, I think even wasting time discussing that lunatic fringe (other than to explicitly dismiss them) is fairly unproductive. If 30% of the country is crazy in one direction, and 80% of the government is crazy in that same direction, discussing the 1% crazy in the other direction can give neutral observers the false impression that ""both sides are equally bad""."
dwsi916,ZombieTesticle,"I disagree. Since you only have two major political parties, about 50% of the population should be in opposition on that metric alone. Add to that, that not even half the population seem to care deeply about, well anything and that at least 10% of people are out of their goddamn minds on any given subject, the fringe becomes incredibly important.These people are violent. They literally assault people and brag about it. They cause public disturbances and shut down speeches by people they disagree with. The media gives them essentially a free pass because to criticize them in anyway is to be put into the *other* camp where you're suddenly a whatever-ist they want to call you that day. They conduct witch-hunts that get people fired and in a few cases have literally led to people committing suicide. I think this merits a little more than dismissal as an irrelevant group.If you want to field criticism against a politician, do it against *specific policies and statements*. God knows there's enough to point a finger at without hand-waving and mumbling something about ""fascism"" and ""misogyny"" like these people do before they break out the air horns and black hoods."
dwsiegr,dweezil22,"If you think 10% of the US are violent leftists, you're deeply wrong."
dwsih0w,ZombieTesticle,I think 10% of any given population are crazy. Left or right doesn't enter into it.
dwsivl6,dweezil22,"Painting opposition to Trump as violent has been an effectively rhetorical tool for the right to discredit meaningful opposition and peaceful protest. [Case in point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrnIVVWtAag). Your paragraph above could be right out of that rhetorical playbook, emphasis mine: > **These people** are violent. **They literally** assault people and brag about it. **They cause** public disturbances and shut down speeches by people they disagree with. **The media gives them essentially a free pass** because to criticize them in anyway is to be put into the other camp where you're suddenly a whatever-ist they want to call you that day. **They conduct witch-hunts** that get people fired and in a few cases have literally led to people committing suicide. I think this merits a little more than dismissal as an irrelevant group.If anything, the general lack of violence in recent protests, relative to the late 60's, which is the closest thing we have to compare with, has been encouraging."
dwsjacq,ZombieTesticle,We're also way more peaceful today than we were during the 1800s. I don't think comparing with student protests during the 60s is very relevant when taking offense as a career choice was not a thing only a few years ago.People are being radicalized and becoming violent and that is not a good thing.
dwsjgqr,dweezil22,Which people?
dwshu8k,Mikeisright,">To paraphrase, intelligence and decency have an anti-Trump bias./r/iamverysmart"
dwsi33v,dweezil22,"Fair point. I phrased that poorly. There are two types of people that support Trump: - The ignorant: People that don't understand trade policy, or the history of US, etc. There are a lot of people like that in the US and they're not necessarily bad.- The indecent: These are the GOP congressmen who suddenly admit to opposing Trump the day they decide not to seek reelection."
dwsiofw,Mikeisright,"I mean, I work in logistics (international trade) and worked both exports and imports. I would say I am very knowledgeable in trade. Tariffs already exist on generally every single item you could imagine, determined by the commodity of like items (Schedule B (exports) / HTS codes (imports)). I can say with 100% certainty that goods of similar harmonized codes do cost more to export than they do to import and it has been like that as long as I've been working for the field.Of the legitimate criticisms one could use for Trump, I don't believe this is one."
dwt8a8d,dweezil22,"I'm not knowledgeable on the exact ins and outs of US tariffs past a cool Planet Money podcast I listened to a while back about companies trying to get classified as raincoats to lower their tariffs. So I will assume you're correct on your point, I certainly know the general harmonized codes are very complicated and often seem rather arbitrary. So...The problem is that Trump takes these complicated issues and hammers at it like a 3rd grader that was just made president. It tends to result in a situation where, at best, he's right and unnecessarily destructive. So there is a binary situation, either: a) China and the US have fair or US favoring trade. In this case we'd obviously want to leave it alone.b) China has a favorable trade relationship with the US that we should improve.If (a), this whole thing is an unmitigated disaster. The problem that is, even granting (b) (which I probably think was generally correct), unilaterally and suddenly applying tariffs is unnecessarily damaging to market certainty and diplomacy. Any European country that doesn't like us can use this as a hedge to cooperate against us. The stock market takes a dive in fears. Etc."
dwv9tlf,Mikeisright,"The problem is you are assuming that trade is fair in both your proposed situations (you said it's binary) - it isn't.Aside from the imposed tariffs being much lower for exports, the licensing fees, customs penalties, and regulations make it extremely difficult to manufacture and ship an equivalent product as opposed to just importing it. This is why even focusing in tariffs alone won't give you an accurate picture of trade. Here is an example:Company X produces an oil viscosity measurement tool in the U.S. and a Chinese company wants to use it. It already costs more to produce here, but now you are faced with shipping it to China. This specific device requires a license - that license costs $2,000 in the US, but China charges $30,000 and requires a full application process complete with pre-clearance, photos, detailed pictures and part numbers, etc. So let's say the company bites the bullet and applies for it but it takes 2 months for approval - that is additional 2 months of overhead, labor cost, additional steps (opening crates, repacking, etc). Then let's say it gets there, but it comes apart on the plane or carrier - very common. If you got 3 of 4 pieces there and it gets cleared, that last piece then needs to be sent back to the US, reapply for license, and hope it clears when you send it back.It's absolutely ridiculous the amount of hoops that foreign governments want the US to jump through. I say let them cry about it, no one in the business will shed a tear."
dwz6los,dweezil22,"I totally agree that this problem/challenge exists, but I disagree that sudden unexpected unilateral tariffs are the way to fix it, which I think I articulated above, but so let me use an analogy instead:Let's say you're a good high school student about to get into MIT and there's a kid on that heckles you at school all the time. Is that wrong? Sure. Would it be a good idea to fight him over it? Probably not, now you're going to get the school administration against you, and you're going to get suspended and you might lose your chance at MIT.This gets back to Trump's policies basically being what some uninformed caller to the local conservative radio show would suggest."
dwseu3a,Dumblerawr,"No one likes to think they bear a resemblance to the unironic ""Obummer"" crowd. Every time I see someone watching CNN they're parroting the dumb Trump quote of the day. Yes he's bad. I would even say he is an evil person. The problem is that these people are going after every little dumb thing he says or does and aren't focusing on the big picture. Nobody is talking about how Trump won. Not in a genuine fashion. People just think they can keep doing what they are doing and Trump will lose because he's the bad guy. If we can't grow out of that mentality as a country, then maybe we aren't ready to fix it yet."
dwsglu2,ZombieTesticle,"Honestly, I think Trump will lose the next election because the only candidate that could possibly lose to him was Hillary. As long as the Democrats can field a candidate that doesn't present the election as it being ""her turn,"" engage in race-baiting or take for granted the support of poor people in the rust belt, they'll win.At this point, they'll win so long as they don't decide to lose, really. Trump's victory only shows two things, imho:1. People hated Hillary and the shenanigans of the DNC so much they voted for *Trump* instead.2. Anyone who is willing to pay lip service or, God forbid, even give voice to the quite legitimate grievances of disenfranchised people who feel that their country has been taken from them by the establishment, republican or democrat, will rally a frankly stupid amount of votes for even a terrible candidate."

dwsr0hr,Meistermalkav,"Think of it this way. We tried leaders of the free world type scenarios, when the axis of the unwilling told Bush to take his irak war and shove it. We still tried when the war was over and the US could not produce a single WMD, not even a single one, to show it hadn't intentionally lied for the beneift of american corporations. Guess those bastions of free thought, democracy, civil rights and fair play that said loud and fucking clear ""Not with us"" went unnoticed (Pun intended). The problem is, when you delegitimize this form of protest, and you go, huh, I delegitimize all this protest, how wonderfull how unopposed I am, you tend to get fast reminders in the form of people doing mean snickers when you get faced with a person you can not delegitimize, because it actually hurts. Progress is never masured by your position on the ladder. Progress is if you moved at all. if germany moved a bit more towards democracy, germany has a consiostently high place on the ladder, but if china moved even a single step, the entire ladder would break out into applause, because it takes monomental effort to move at all. Take the russia europe relationship. Most europeans don't think that badly of russia. If you disregard the american media, the european view on russia is basically america, but with vodka and ushankas. And what do europeans do? They work gently, carefully, and use the old idea of, if we don't have any contact with our neighbor at all, we can't be neighborly. We know, the trade is important for russia, so we keep a trickle up. And let's face it, Russia does not produce a lot we need, so it's difficult to find the small things you could import, but it has wonderfull culture. But wonder over wonder, suddenly, we have a trade of culture, and of very small things, and we have reasons to send tradesmen back and forth. and they carry tiny bits of our culture with them. And suddenly, we go, yea, we can buy your gas, that's not hard to explain, even our Daddys bought your gas, but what will be hard to explain is how much semichki we want to import. You ask yourself, what is the problem? Well, if you look at the newspapers, death, destruction, badness, ect, if we now bring back the sunflower seeds, they will immediatelly think we applaud your behavior. Now, are they at least Bio? What I mean? Well, let's face it, you are a tradesman, I am one too, the bio seal in russia is completely new and nonexistant. If I now claim, hey, I saw these sacks of semichki in russia, and I noticed they were bio, and I bought about 3 tons, I can get rid of this easily. Yes, just for the seal! They like the idea this much. And we both know that both you and me don't have the pull to get much of anything done, but at the least, I want to bring semichki to my people! And bit by bit, we corrupt the people, and change their environment. And suddenly, they are in a village that is similar to european villages, that has a partner city status with european villages, that has european machines, because of the partnership, and even an european architect, and most of the people are amazied by the fields of biologically ok sunflowers that are growing around the village, the village is busy making semichki for export only, and there are so many meetings about an european seal of bio, and forming a half russian half european comission of semichki quality controll that the local hotel gets a stream of westerners, so the caffees get more traffic, the people get more westerners, and pretty fucking soon, this town is thoroughly westernised, just by the power of trade."
dwsr0tf,Meistermalkav,"And if you have this thoroughly westernised town, you can pull this up in scale, and westernise the region. Suddenly, you have 15 towns in the region, all with ties and partner cities / towns in germany, all with sending delegations to germany, and recieving them, a few even with cities in france and greece, all of them farming semichki for the sale in europe, all of them with seats on the local council of semichki relations, all of them sending their kids to european style schools, ect. Then, it is only a question of time before we build so much goodwill amongst the people, just by our semichki loving antics, that maybe we will not get the big prize, but in a generation, the guys that grow up now will have spent their summers in european style friendship camps and speak german / english, because their fathers sold semichki to europe, and all in all, fuck me, it's amazing over there, how come we don't have this shit over at us, I mean, this is not that different? And boom, just to exposure to a powerfull culture, we infect the other culture. if the culture is powerfull enough, they think german music, they either think techno, or they think rammstein / nena, because they have become impregnated by our culture. And don't tell me any other european nation is worse in it, because wherever I look, I see nations that could outdo germany easily in hospitality. And with time and time, the local kids will have european standarts, not because they went to school in europe, but because of the trade. They will tell us what we should trade next, what's actually good in the region. They want their own countries to be left alone, but admit it, everyone likes a bit of cultural warfare. Because if cultural warfare means you eat my sausage, I eat yours, we compare which tastes better, this is warfare everyone can agree to. And then the americans come, and say, we embargo russia, and suddenly, all that blyatifull progress is destroyed, because whenever they have a socially retarded president, they become socially retarded as a country and antagonize the whole world in a bid to show them they are still relevant. And the russians of course have to repocitrate, and we stand here, dicks out, chewing on the last semichki, because our friends from those tiny russian villages get ripped away from us, and we were not allowed to drink brotherhood, and we feel violated. Fuck it, we can do the same with China. We can go to local chinese villages, and we can buy rice. OF course, that means we have to send a delegation over, we find the local most rustic villages in germany, and we go, okay, this is a village in the shadow of the alps, let's pack the alp horns, dress the entire delegation up in dirndl and lederhosen, and transport a bavarian herd of cows with two steers to the village. And they will be mortified when the bavarians arrive, or having a laughing fit (Lert's be homnest, the chances are 50 / 50), and start bringing all this strong culture, and the herd of cows will be thanked for, but they don't fucking know what to do with the new cows... and they want to partner up? They mean it? They could have had Tsingdao or any other city, but they want the partner village of us, the smallest of the villages in fucking nowhere? Fuck yea! And before long, there is a local german culture club, several of the local ladies wear imported german dirndl, the local cows graze peacefully, because they are rustic as shit and need to be hit by a 2 ton truck before they move, and the local youths repurpose the alphorns we left over there as giant bongs because with all the jodeling we forgot to tell them what they are for. And we let it fester and stew, and then we charter lufthansa flights for them, to visit us. OH you holy shit, there will be a full on culture program, with yodeling, and gamsbart, and western values, and freedom, and drinking as much beer as you can till you vomit, and then drink some more. and we will discuss that rice is really really multi purpose, and we as a village would like to have all the bio rice they can sell, could you please help us. You know the rice, you know bio, let's figure something out. Oh, and coincidentially, you have problems with electricity? We have had, too, untill we went renewable, it-..... what do you mean, you can build that cheaper? Son, let's have an other beer, and you tell me all about that. And because we don't label this a diplomatic mission, and because it's not all about western values and shit, it's about the rice, you see, and the semichki, and so forth, suddenly, we get green light, because exporting semichki to europe, fuck, that sounds like plan that debil cooked up, but lets see if it works, and the same with rice to the alps. We use the trade as a channel though wich we establish diplomatic missions. What otherwise would get road blocked because ""we don't want german / european values over here"" passes because, suddenly, it's not about the values, it's about the product you see, and we travell over here too, so we give as much back as we take. So we spread the value.... what do you mean this is exactly how cosmopolitanism works? Fuck those guys are good at that! Democracy? Fuck me, we don't teach that, this would be diplomacy and statesmanship, and we germans are horrible at that. Instead, we teach them about electing the local beer and wine queen, it's all in good fun, right, pretty girl from the reigion who represents the local interests of the beer and wine farmers, PR figure head, who could say anything against that? It's not democracy, it's publicity, but see, you guys make a pretty damn tasty wine, this wine must have a wine queen. Civil rights? What is that? This is a trade and culture mission, right? Oh, we make sure we get our delegation before fasching, so they can see how the local mayor has to leave his office for 7 days, because the crazy women now rule, for those 7 days. Oh, it's not really ruling, you see, it's tradition, they mostly drink wine and eat candy, why don't you go and mingle with our kader of drunken feminist trade unionists, oops, did I say this out loud, well, two can play this game, and the last time you let me talk to a farmer it turned out the farmer understood english but the translator was the son of the local party chief, so, two can play that game. Fair play? Please, this is cultural and tradition and trade exchange, can't you see? I mean, who would have anything against us teaching you guys about soccer? I mean, soccer is basically germany. Now, you have a tradition to eat sausages in a bun, drink local beer and wine, wear locally knitted items on your hat, the crazier the better, watch 11 people play against each other, not based on affiliation but based on merit, and all over, we can sit here, together, despite being from different regimes and from opposite sides of the earth, and cheer for our teams, because this is not diplomacy, this is culture and trade.... Motherfucker, this international friendship, again? Fuck, you guys are good at this. Can we have some more bratwurst please, it goes well with plum wine, don't you think, and nobody had anything against electing the prettiest local plum farmers daughter as the plum wine queen. Fucking stroke of genius, that is, contests of beauty are highly sought off. Not one party official said anything after we explained to him that we basically needed a figurehead for the local plum wine sales, and we elected it based on beauty. We have done this time and time again. Every village over 500 people has a partner city, the more opressed and foreign the place the better. Several have partner cities even in america. Where I grew up, two villages over, this village was the envy of the area, because they managed to snag up an honest to god zulu village in the middle of nowhere, and they had a god damn cultural exchange like a motherfucker. Within 3-4 years, several of the local girls managed to ululate, while they had the entire crew from there walk around in sandals and white socks by day 4. This is trade diplomancy. You don't trade with the people because you allready like them, you trade with the people because you don't trust them. Because you never want it to come to the ""it's us versus them"" phase, you want it to stay at ""It's your president versus my president, we can't do shit against this, but when this is over, you promise we will have a soccer rematch, I could really go for some german wine with chinese dumplings.

Thats why you cheer and upvote Everytime the stock market takes a dip. You litterally want it to crashHow fucking sad is that?The facts are Trump is good for the economy.

We have been down the free trade road and we have been down the tariffs road, we know how each one of these ends. Tariffs, those never really end well. I don't hate America, I love it. I enlisted and served 4 years as a Marine under its flag. You're also wrong about me wanting Trump to fail. I don't. I want him to succeed but when his actions on this are aligned with the same failed actions of the past (like the Smoot-Hawley act) then I can't have much hope for his success. He set himself up to fail on this and it's sad because he had the tool he needed to be successful waiting for him when he was inaugurated. I hope you're right and I am wrong but if this gets penned as official policy, I really don't think you will be."

dwslf1a,Cautemoc,"It started with lies that China manipulated currency, despite overwhelming evidence they either stopped a while ago or it was never as prevalent as the right claimed.Edit: Since apparently people can't do research before relying on their misinformation to downvote, [here's one of many examples of it being disproven](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/what-you-may-not-know-about-china-and-currency-manipulation/)."

dwsltj4,Cautemoc,Do a little research. You're about 10 years too late.
dwsg9im,Masterreeferr,"Being ""justified"" is irrelevant. The problem is that Trump claims the point is to create more jobs in America and encourage companies to use American steel/aluminum which is a perfectly fine idea on paper, but instead of approaching it logically all he's done is cause massive problems. There's a reason there's been so much backlash against these tariffs from both parties equally. It is simply a stupid move. This will only hurt the economy, not help it. Trump is the one either being petty or being irrational/illogical. China is just being logical and not letting a petty/irrational move go unpunished. What Trump is doing is stupid and China is responding to it."
dwsh7gs,smokeyrobot,Yea all of what you said is some weird excuse. This is all about closing the trade deficit with China something candidate Trump claimed he was going to do.China is also increasing tariffs on products that already had tariffs. Yet they were never chastised in the media for using defensive tariffs to stimulate job growth in the Chinese economy.Edit: Wow apparently these comments are being used as a battleground for Trump hate. Grow the fuck up Reddit.
dwshz2l,TheDovahofSkyrim,"Yeah, something I don't understand in the least. The simple fact of the matter is that we've been in a trade war with China for a while now, but only one side was fighting. I don't necessarily like the way Trump is going about retaliating and think there were smarter moves, but I will withhold judgement on this to see how it plays out. I think the US would normally ""win"" this if the only decider was pure economics, but unfortunately our politicians are much, much more responsive to public pressure than the Chinese officials and thus can wait this out politically."
dwt19n0,smokeyrobot,">The simple fact of the matter is that we've been in a trade war with China for a while now, but only one side was fighting.Exactly. I read James Rickards' Currency Wars 7 years ago and all of this was well-known in Wall Street. It was just not openly talked about outside of it.Also The market almost instantly rebounded on open. What does that say about the confidence of investors over this latest development? I can't stand Trump but this would be huge. Everyone knows at the current trajectory China will surpass the US in terms of economy in the next 100 years but no one is willing to try and stand up the for US. All of a sudden one of the most distasteful men in America is doing it as President."
dwtbly9,Cautemoc,"Oh.. your knowledge base is from over 7 years go, that must be why you're so behind the times. There is no “currency war” from China anymore. It's well-known they stopped that crap years ago."
dwuxxbq,smokeyrobot,Ah that makes sense. Your other comment tells someone that they are 10 years behind on saying China is manipulating their currency. Is it years ago or 10 years ago? Inconsistency makes me think you are the one who doesn't have enough information. Feel free to share facts if you have some.
dwuys90,Cautemoc,"Well, by definition 10 years ago is also years ago. Being more specific in one thread doesn't indicate a lack of information by being more general elsewhere. That baseless accusation aside, I can absolutely give you some facts.10 years ago was based on the article [here](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/what-you-may-not-know-about-china-and-currency-manipulation/).>The solid line in the chart above shows that the yuan has strengthened 35% against the U.S. dollar over the *past decade*. All else equal, this represents an effective rise in the price of Chinese exports to the United States by more than one-third, which is certainly not consistent with the charge of continued intentional underpricing.>Also, the price of Chinese exports depends on the yuan price of what it costs to manufacture in China, not just the yuan price of foreign currencies, and inflation in China has been higher than that of its trading partners. The multilateral, inflation-adjusted price of Chinese exports (represented by the dashed line in the chart) accounts for both of these factors. The chart shows that the overall real relative price of worldwide Chinese exports has risen more than 50% in the *past decade*, with almost 40% of this increase in the past two years. This has occurred because of the yuan's appreciation against the dollar, the yuan's appreciation against the currencies of its other trading partners (as the dollar has appreciated), and the higher rate of inflation in China than among its trading partners.So, the reference was based on multiple data points referencing the last decade. However, accounting for 40% of the inflation being the last 2 years (from 2015, so another 3 years have passed), even under the most extreme interpretation they stopped at least years ago.Edit: Here's another source for you that specifically references 10 years ago.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/business/economy/trump-china-currency-manipulation-trade.html"
dwv14k2,smokeyrobot,"It wasn't a baseless accusation. It was pointing to inconsistency and asking for clarification. Be careful about assumptions. I appreciate the links and research.>From 2000 to 2014 China definitely suppressed the rise of the renminbi to maintain a competitive advantage for its exports, buying dollars hand over fist and adding $4 trillion to its foreign reserves over the period.Also if you want to be more specific, 2014 isn't 10 years ago (from that NY Times article)."
dwv2k5l,Cautemoc,"You're right, they didn't claim that China stopped 10 years ago, but that the time to act was 10 years ago. I misunderstood the information a bit. The article summary is:>President Trump promised action against manipulation. But Beijing is now propping up the renminbi, not weakening it. The time to act was a decade ago.I will change how I communicate this point in the future to be more accurate. Acknowledging my mistake, I think you should look at your own communication here.>Is it years ago or 10 years ago? Inconsistency makes me think you are the one who doesn't have enough information. That may not be a direct accusation, but it is pretty obviously implied. I wouldn't be so sensitive on this topic if there weren't such an incredible amount of nationalistic hatred in any story about China. They aren't perfect, for sure, but they're really not that bad either. It's kind of embarrassing when Americans dogpile onto China over every misdeed in their past and use it as a reason that any irrational attack against them is justified."
dwsu1u3,AVALANCHE_CHUTES,I think the US is justified but how is China petty? It's looking out for its self interest too and wants to maintain the status quo.

It was the British who flooded China with literal shittons of cheap Opium, and then beat the shit out of the Chinese when they tried to kick them out. China has been fucked by pretty much everyone at some point in its history. It makes sense, they've been around long enough.Mongols, Indians, Japanese, Koreans, Russians. The Yuan Dynasty, Ming, Qing, Opium Wars, Boxer Rebellion. By 1900 China was effectively an international playground for the Europeans. It's one reason the Communists even got as powerful as they did, and they still needed a Japanese *and then Russian* invasion to sufficiently weaken their rivals in order to take power.There's a lot of history to be proud of if you're Chinese, but the country has far from a flawless record."

dwskr4h,EatzGrass,"It's going to be painful, but we are going to win and be fine.There are only 2 ways to create money from nothing. Either take it out of the earth and sell it or use materials and manufacture it. Every other job; Lawyer, banker, stockbroker, policeman, doctor, lawmaker, teacher etc. just pushes money around. No new money comes into the system and these professions take their cut out of the pool. Oh, I guess we could print money, but that has a whole new set of negative consequences.Our current system since the early 90's has allowed most of our manufacturing happen in poor countries like China for a nice short term profit bang into retailers and manufacturing company owners. This has created giant monopolistic corporate behemoths that trade globally but provide zero or net loss to the U.S. economy as a whole besides their stock prices which I'll get to in a minute. The effect has been extremely negative as the population as a whole has to fight over the scraps left from operating in an almost pure service economy.The pain is going to come from adding the costs of paying our manufacturers to make our goods now. These manufacturers are saddled with the extreme overhead of operating in a service economy but that doesn't make their existence less necessary. The status quo of giant corporations will burn and stock prices will fall hard once the common worker is able to eek out a small profit making stuff to sell. Personally, I feel that's where Trump is going to lose his balls once he realizes stock market loss must be accounted for. He knows that stock prices gauge success in a president and won't be able to handle most Americans taking a hit on their 401k's.Anyway, if we do get through this correction, these new manufacturers will infuse their economies with jobs and money. All local services mentioned before will benefit from this. A rising tide lifts all boats. Don't listen to anyone that says you can make anything on a 3d printer and robots by the way. That's fucking stupid. I've been in manufacturing my whole life and ALL manufacturing requires manual labor.Edit; I forgot to answer you actual question. A deficit is a deficit and if our 10 percent tariff matches their 50, then if we match, they are out of fucking cards to play. Sure, some sectors like corporate farming are going to take a hit, but who's up for cheaper food? raises hand..."

dwstxto,Brand_Awareness,"Top level manager at global manufacturer here -- let me start off by saying you can certainly get away with automation; not for everything as of today, but as AI develops so machines can have more fluid operational parameters than present what little value human labor brigs to the table will be eroded. I think what your maybe distracted by is the fact that manufacturing is still a relative infant industry in the U.S. due to it's development being stunted in the 90's by the outsourcing wave -- lots of Ma and Pa ""build to print"" organizations still exist and run more-or-less like they did in the 80's; they didn't need to adapt to new market conditions (apart from there being much less work) because those market conditions were only concerned with the majority of manufacturing activities which were taking place elsewhere in the world. They don't understand how things have changed because they figured they were doing well to be open so never bothered educating themselves while their customers couldn't be bothered to spend the time -- they think that when the work comes back state side they'll be in line, what they don't realize is a large portion of it already has without all this trade war B.S.; they just weren't in the loop because they can't really handle the needs of their customers anymore nor are they prepared to make the changes necessary as quickly as they would need to do so.I'll also point out that your premise about wealth generation is incorrect. While it's true that service is low-value compared to physical product at the entity level (for individuals service is -- the people on the line actually producing the stuff are the least valuable; plenty of people can screw one thing to another, much fewer can do the Cpk gage R&R analysis in conformance to ISO17025 required for capacity/capability validation) it certainly doesn't mean that service products generate no value -- services exist to meet market demands which set valuation; the fact that someone is paid to render service means that service has the value of that payment. For instance you say bankers don't produce value/money, but they arrange the finances necessary for organizations to maintain operational budgets month-to-month, if bankers didn't exist than organizations -- including those that extract things or make things -- could not function as they would not have the monetary resources necessary to do so. Thus to say they do not make money/have value is simply incorrect; they make money/have value because they produce a service that is every bit as necessary to our way of life as people making car engines... could even likely say more so.Now, whether we can shelter this trade war and emerge a stronger economy is debatable -- it is true that these trade deals has made exporting jobs and importing the profits much easier which has certainly hurt the U.S. economy more than it has hurt the economies where those jobs were shipped to. However to simply assume that there is an internal demand large enough to support itself to the extent necessary to maintain standard of living for all citizens is not accurate either. Certainly the idea that the U.S. will return to its glory days of the post-war to globalization era is absolutely ludicrous -- we had so much wealth then because we were the world's exporter, so shutting ourselves off to global trade is guaranteed to prevent us from achieving those levels of success."
dwsxz46,EatzGrass,"Well we are at a tipping point as far as finding stuff for people to do. Maybe that line worker provides limited value for the corporation, but it sure as hell provides value for his community. Corporations, by their very nature, cannot be trusted to do the right thing and we are at a point where we either pay people outright for doing nothing or pay them to do menial tasks again. Things really are that dire and the shortsightedness of industrializing poor countries for the sake of short term profits might mean saving manufacturing is now impossible. Either way, we either throw our hands in the air and give up, or try to fix things. I stated in a reply that services do not create money because of taxes. An exchange of money is not a zero sum game since the government has it's hands out on the transaction. I'm sure you have seen the results on a macro scale of the effects of giving our manufacturing away to people who have a ""as long as I get mine"", and a ""race to the bottom"" attitude. These are basic tenets of untethered capitalism and it really does not work for the benefit of the general population which we are painfully finding out now. The corporations drive for increased PROFITS is the very base of problems with the system. It forces a corporation to stomp on their neighbor and consume them for shareholder confidence. You aren't going to invest in a company with a flatline 6 percent profit margin with no opportunity for growth and it would be dumb to do that as an owner since profitability attracts competition and your competitive lifespan would be limited. This is how we end up with disgusting entities like Nestle with 8500 brands.I understand my sentiments may be utopian but this party is going to end VERY soon whether we like it or not. Someones going to call in that debt someday then the empire is going to fall."
dwt900o,Brand_Awareness,"Agreed entirely on your points about productive work, but that's capitalism for you; much to your point we may need to rethink as to whether or not this model is still the most productive or start admitting that there isn't an endless supply of jobs to support unlimited people and start thinking about population control per economic conditions. It's not an easy situation in the slightest."
dwu3owa,EatzGrass,"Well it appears it's just spitballing anyway since the market thinks this is all bullshit since our faire maiden in chief can't be trusted in anything he says and the market feels like he's going to puss out.

dwsn5nc,WarpSprite,">There are only 2 ways to create money from nothing. Either take it out of the earth and sell it or use materials and manufacture it. Every other job; Lawyer, banker, stockbroker, policeman, doctor, lawmaker, teacher etc. just pushes money around.Wait I don't get it. Can you explain how a person in manufacturing is creating money form nothing where as a Bar waiter is not? Or even getting something from the ground is **creating** money? Its creating wealth but not money in my view those are two very different things."
dwsoham,EatzGrass,"Your example is closer to manufacturing than say a banker although resale is off the table. If something exists that didn't previously exist that is worth money, I would say that it is created. I think the difference lies in a good or material to retain value whereas a service gets consumed at a net loss to both parties since taxes are involved."
dwsx9wk,oximoran,"Surely a service is a net gain to both parties, or why would it be performed? I buy services because they have value to me; I sell my services because they have value to others. Tax cuts into the surplus value, but doesn't usually make it negative."
dwsnki8,OK6502,"Eh, technically debt creates new money via leverage. And adding value to a product does as well (say you buy 10$ of wood and you turn that into a table and sell it for 40$, you have just created value through labour). There are other mechanisms as well. So this isn't quite accurate"
dwsntce,EatzGrass,That's manufacturing though
dwsq7ma,OK6502,"I used a simplistic example but the idea is you create value, one way or another. We're kind of going back to Marx's idea of surplus value here but effectively labour generally adds value to something. You don't even need a physical something to add value - see for example the service industry, particularly software which sells, if anything, ideas rather than a thing. It's hard to explain the tech sector's wealth with your model."
dwsnx76,Ajajajajaddffff,"Software throws another huge curveball into that simple definition too. Creating it from nowhere or adding additional features to existing software. Also if a doctor saves someone's life, I think we can assume that will somehow indirectly create money down the road that would not have existed otherwise."
dwsopvb,EatzGrass,"Debt is a little different. local debt is a net loss due to taxes, but foreign debt is a net gain but it really depends on what you are selling. Either way, if you have a system that continuously pushes money around that is taxed on each side, you will eventually run out of money."
dwspzfk,OK6502,"Only if you were somehow taxed and then the money was literally burned. Taxes are used to fund the government - the means the money is reinserted into the local economy directly (through purchases) or indirectly (through wages). Some of it may exit the local economy as well, obviously, say servicing debt obligations, but that also assumes that somehow the local economy isn't getting money in. Obviously, in some cases, local economies run out of money but that isn't due to taxation per se."
dwspyq7,HumaneSasquatch,"Since you missed it in his post, ""There are only 2 ways to create money from nothing. Either take it out of the earth and sell it or use materials and manufacture it."""
dwsqba1,OK6502,"Explain the service industry then, particularly things like software."
dwth7y6,HumaneSasquatch,"Can you please read it one more time, specifically, the part where he included ""taking it out of the earth and sell it or use materials and manufacture it."" That answer is in agreement of your previous example about creating a table through manufacturing.Taking materials out of the ground (including food), and manufacturing things out of said materials are the two things that can be used to actually create money. People and industry can survive on those two things alone, but without those things, all other industry would not exist.That also includes the service industry and software - there would be no means for the economy to support either of those without without, as /u/EatzGrass stated, ""either tak(ing) it out of the earth and sell it or use (those) materials and manufacture it""I can't see how that isn't true"
dwtwlh1,OK6502,"What all of these things have in common is the creation of value through labour. OP is a bit more materialistic about what he considers the creation of wealth (borderline comodity fetichism). I contend that any labour has the potential to create wealth. This is most spectacularly demonstrated by the tech industry, which has real transformative powers to turn something as ephemeral as ideas into value.This is similar to using finance to generate wealth through mathematics and psychology. Which is why i mentioned debt"

dwsho60,usa_foot_print,Oh I know other industries have been booming. But those other industries also have trouble because manufacturing has gone overseas due to lower quality. Japan has great quality but that has stayed in Japan.
dwshxz3,wintervenom123,"Can you rewrite your sentence, what do you mean lower quality? If a competitors had better quality steel and that was wanted by manufacturers they would buy that.

dwsdi43,camelCaseCoffeeTable,"Honestly I'm torn on whether I support this or not. To be fair, China has been acting unfairly in terms of IP for a long time, and this is finally waking them up and has them talking about finding a solution before things get bad. On the other hand, is a trade war really what we need right now with everything else on our plate?"
dwsedjl,AvalancheZ250,"You are correct in assuming that China has stringent IP laws that are at odds with the West, but a trade war in 2018 is the absolute worst possible way to deal with it. These tariffs will only serve to strengthen China's view in their own IP laws, now that they see that the US government cannot do anything about it other than the trade war route. China knows it can fight a trade war, so it won't back down. If the US really wanted to change China's IP policy they should have picked a battlefield to which China could not defend properly. Failure to do so has only boosted their confidence in their own practices. Why quit when you're ahead? Not only that, but the US is torn between domestic problems, aggravated allies and an unpredictable North Korea. Having a trade war with its biggest trading partner, also the worlds second largest economy and a nuclear power is a classic case of biting off more than you can chew, except you've tried to bite 4 different things at once. If Trumps administration gets their act together they could probably sort out this mess. **IF**"
dwskcvb,csbob2010,China has a huge advantage because it doesn't really matter what the people think or how they are impacted. Whereas Trump has to establish and maintain popular support to continue or the political fallout will be too great. He also has at least half of the population that will hate this no matter what out of political bias. China has none of these problems.

dwsqih9,dene323,"TPP or the same thing by another name; build consensus with EU, Japan and others to pressure China through WTO. It will take a long time but the Chinese would quietly come to the negotiation table. With a one on one trade war though, surrendering to US highly public threat is affecting the CCP's ruling legitmacy, so they have no other choice but to retaliate, but unlike the US, they have near full public support, because even the more pro west intellectuals or officials wouldn't dare speak out in support of surrendering to US demand without a fight, in fear of being labeled under US payroll."

dwt4t7s,YoroSwaggin,"A total trade war? Nah.The trade battle that's currently going on? Hell yeah. We're not fighting China. We're doing the equivalent of sparring/training China right now with our tariffs, whereas the Chinese tariffs are actual stabs with tangible consequences.Unless we pull back heavily on high tech manufacturing and exporting that China doesn't have, while simultaneously setting up alternative partners (most damaging would be SEA, India), China won't give a damn because they can take it. We have more problems than just Chinese predatory IP practices. And Chinese tariffs hit those problems nicely. We need to create more problems for China than just supply hiccups, because they'll just set up their own market for it."
dwshhle,camelCaseCoffeeTable,"That's an interesting point. It does show a lack of soft power routes to take, reeking of desperation. I'm still not sure China can win though.

dwsqgkw,squired,"They have spent the last decade diversifying and entering new markets. A US trade war will hurt like hell for China, but it doesn't represent the killing blow it once did.

dwsvv7w,Freechoco,"TPP was that soft power move. True is we still have a lot of ways to influence China. Even without us signing the new TPP, it already is an attack on China economic power in south east asia.Although 2 decades from now, I won't be surprise if Vietnam or Thai start stealing ip as well because the ip laws in new TPP are gone. Some new deal will likely be pursuit in the future to prevent this."
dwt3xwf,YoroSwaggin,"Vietnam will be an interesting case study. It's the latest Asian tiger, it's got plenty of experiences observing similar ""miracle growth"" economies from Japan, SK, Taiwan, to China. It's not as strong as China so it won't have power to force favorable deals, but it's got plenty of past experience to sustain its miracle growth phase, with decent geography and demography.China's miracle growth period is pretty much over, and impossible to replicate again. If China fails to push for more influence and become leaders of a few critical, high tech new industries, their aggressive international reputation will bite them in the ass as the emerging SEA countries, and possibly India, not to the rest of the developed world, fill the manufacturing gap, traditionally done by Chinese manufacturers. If China doesn't emerge out of this a world leader in electric autos, solar energy (2 fields they've heavily invested in), they'll be left in the dust and crumble from numerous social issues arising as their population ages. They have enough population to self sustain but their position in the world is pretty much gone if they choose isolation."
dwsw29l,camelCaseCoffeeTable,"Yeah TPP wasn't perfect, but it was essentially us buying influence in Asia. It's a shame so many were against it, soft power is being overlooked or just not understood these days. I definitely don't know a ton about international diplomacy, but I feel like losing a bit of money for more influence isn't the worst trade in the world, especially when it was right in China's backyard."
dwsx71x,Freechoco,"The U.S doesn't even stand to lose money on TPP in the long run. The fastest growing market in the entire world right now is in South east Asia; those nations are literally going through the exact same process China did decades ago when it starting to bring most of it population out of poverty and into the middle class.Now China market is huge and we keep hearing what? Corporations bending to China laws in order to have access to their middle class consumers. Companies like blizzard have to source their games to net ease, a Chinese company that operate blizzard games and directly cutting blizzard profit in China.TPP literally was a nail in the coffin to stop this happening against in those south east Asia countries in the future. The old ip laws would have lock those nations from trying to do what China is doing, and pave way for companies like Blizzard to fully operate their games in those region, getting a much bigger chunk of profit then they are now in China. The same for all tech industries that are being taken advantage of by China right now.Ip laws in the old TPP still suck for those nations though, but for U.S interests it was a nominal win."

The moment you start gaining popularity, a giant, mostly automated division of that large corporation picks up your content and starts mass producing it much faster, reaching your potential audiences much faster.

A recession for either of them, let alone both, would hurt us all. The EU, UK and Japan are strong enough to survive, but everyone else is going to be fu**** as much as China and America. No matter which way you look at it, it's a lose-lose for everyone. Not to mention the possibility of a new Cold War. No one wants that.

If the other party refuses to negotiate, what do you do? And ""suck it up and continue to get fucked"" I don't think is a good response."

dwsfcqq,AvalancheZ250,"Of course. The WTO is seen as a joke by both the US and China. It's just that China is using whatever power the WTO does have to its own ends, while the US is actively railing against it. China is the economic enemy to the hegemonic economic power. To everyone else, it's just business. They'll take their stuff elsewhere if they can't sell it in the US. The EU will likely stick with the US even after Trump thanks to military alliances, but a lot of smaller economies will not. Pretty much the entire world (except Saudi Arabia and Israel) is in the “anti-Trump” camp now. They will likely stay like that until Trump is no longer president.

dwsiitw,TarBallsOfSteel,"That's actually what's wrong with trumps negotiation strategy. Approaching negotiations with an attitude of ""I need to win"" will always end up with a suboptimal result unless you have significant bargaining leverage.Pushing a hard line isn't a bad thing by itself.

dwsl0w1,Conjwa,"But Trump does have significant leverage here, in a sense. Chinese exports to the US account for $650 billion dollars a year, roughly 6% of their GDP (for the uninitiated, that is a HUGE percentage). US exports to China account for roughly $110 billion, or 0.5% of the US GDP. The Chinese have vastly more to lose in this scenario when looking at it from that perspective, and I'm sure that's what Trump is counting on. Not sure it's going to work, but there is at least some logic to it.The issue for the US will be the increase cost of goods, but that's really self-imposed by US sanctions more than it is by China's.Still, as someone with a lot of money in the market, I am not going to enjoy this ride."

You are limiting children and parents opportunity for survival. Structural/market conditions that provide better life opportunities, and so better choices, likely involving education, are the right path. By the time you pass a law forbiding hard child labour, you do so because survival is no longer at stake as a result of the practice.We/Trump don't carre about wages and working conditions in China.

If businesses want free trade, they need to accept UBI and the taxation which comes along with it.

dwsgt64,magneticanisotropy,We could have joined something designed specifically to help protect USA ip and to limit Chinese trading power that also would have further opened markets for USA goods. It even had a sweet acronym. TPP?
dwt4mbg,sprucenoose,"There are many, many avenues to deal with that problem in a more hardline manner:1. Go through the WTO. We did that many times previously, and won in many cases with China. Winning a case with the WTO generally means that every other country in the WTO applies a duty on certain exports from the losing country as punishment, and the winning country can apply such a duty to offset its losses. FYI, this is exactly what China is going to do to the US as a result of the US's unilaterally tariffs, meaning the US will be hammered by every other country if China wins.2. Enter into a trade agreement that protects US IP and provides economic leverage against China. We almost had that. It is called the Trans Pacific Partnership, or TPP. Trump torpedoed it, having China a HUGE win and weakening our negotiating position.3. Take other economic actions against China that are not so obvious and inflammatory. For example, devalue the US currency a bit. China hates that. They flipped their shit with the US's recent quantitative easing, which had nothing to do with China directly, which is why China couldn't do anything about it.4. Engage in a diplomatic solution. China wants lots of non-economic things from the US, e.g., less interference with the South China sea, less interference with Taiwan, easier relationships with North Korea, etc. negotiate a deal.5. Sink to China's level. China is now developing lots of new, innovative items that it has an interest in protecting. Refuse to enforce China's IP unless they enforce the US's. Appropriate their IP at times as well.These are just a few examples, there are innumerable tools in the toolkit here. A trade war will hurt the US a great deal, and galvanize China's government and population against us, making a negotiated solution much more difficult. We will be lucky if we can get back the amounts we lost as a result of the tariff retaliation."

Their domestic market alone would be able to fuel whatever R&D might require.I think you're over-inflating the value of a consumer. The US has maybe 400 million people and China has three times as many. If a chinese person buys the product that an american had previously, it's the same for the producer. There is no benefit to americans consuming products than chinese consuming them.As countries like China and India grow more wealthy, it was inevitable that they would be shifting from exporting to the US to just meeting the needs of their own growing middle-class.

dwsdybl,LATABOM,"This isn't true at all. The value of the products on each side is the same. Also, if China and the US each double the value the tariffs, China will be taxing 100% of US goods while the US will.only be taxing 20% of China's. That means the USA then has 80% of China's goods to still tax, while China is already done and out of ammo, which gives the USA some leeway in choosing which goods they want to let through. Besides all this, there are a lot of US manufacturers who might see the writing on the wall and move shop to Vietnam, India, Eastern Europe or even the USA, which would be a net win for human rights, environmental policies and trade regulations (which China flouts via currency manipulation) and still pile on the negative effects for China. No Chinese companies have manufacturing facilities in the USA so they cant play the same card. The USA has several orders of magnitude more ""ammunition"" in this war than China."
dwsfa7d,tictaxtoe,China can still double the taxes on that 100 % for the same monetary hit. China has room to move until American products are too expensive to be sold in China period effectively banning them.
dwsh2n3,LATABOM,"Yes and the USA can do the same thing but with approximately 9 times the quantity and value of products. The trade deficit is real. China earns over 9 times more than the USA does via trade between the 2 countries, despite having a smaller economy. The USA can hurt China quantitatively 10x more than China can hurt the USA and relative to GDP about 20 times more. Additionally, the USA can sell to plenty of other countries to recoup value with some restructuring and hard work by exporters, but China will never be able to fill the void that the USA will leave in Chinas exports. China also has much lower environmental standards, abysmal human rights standards, and manipulates its currency in a way which would be illegal under WTO and IMF rules. Trump's a piece of shit, but Its nice to see China put in its place, and if this pushes Walmart, Apple and major clothing brands to move at least part of their production to India/Vietnam/Mexico/Poland/Canada/(gasp) USA, it'll be a global net win. If China is forced to stop manipulating currency and being a fuckhead in the south China sea in order to stop the trade war, all the better for everyone."
dwt6ks5,BananaParadise,That makes sense. But why didn't US companies relocate production to those aforementioned countries in the first place? Why put all their eggs in one basket and bet sht like this doesn't happen?
dwsx2qs,Asstrodamus,Very under rated comment

dwsluln,CookedStew,Dumb and short sighted? Hes just bringing forth relevant arguments that creates discussion. You're the one insulting him. Who's really dumb and shortsighted?
dwskf8j,LATABOM,"Trump has 3-7 years left. The tariffs will last his entire presidency and probably at least a year into the next one unless he ""wins"" some concessions, which would probably make China less appealing anyways. This whole thing puts the writing on the wall that the golden age of tax-free, EPA free, union free access to China is at risk. American companies will be forced to spread out operations among other countries to mitigate risk to shareholders."
dwu2489,iampoopingrightnow1,"Given how retarded the population is right now, I'll give it to you, he might win another term and continue this for another 7-8 years.Back on topic, instead of trading with China, you prefer trade with another poor and lawless state just because it's not China. What was the point of this tariff again? MAGA? IP protection? Also you really think it can come back to America? Do you even know why consumer electronics are not automated and instead prefer to use a slave labor human factory?And how is this a global win? When you tax tech you also tax the entire global supply chain where the people who benefit the most are America's allies who are reliant on high tech exports.Stop making decisions based on ""fuck China."" The Chinese tariffs are much smarter. Taxing agriculture affects not just farmers (America #1) but also GMO development (Where America is #1) and the fertilizer industry (#1 here too I think)."
dwus9fw,LATABOM,"Since when are the countries I named lawless?I don't think 98% of US production in china can come back to the US currently, but hopefully this draws some attention to the issue, at least. I remember when Democrats used to oppose NAFTA, free trade with China, etc because it sold out workers and was mainly about boosting profits for large corporations.Now politicians of every stripe are fretting about Apple / Amazon / Walmart / PVH, companies that exist because they're allowed to fuck their workers as hard and as long as they want.The Chinese tariffs are no ""smarter"" than the US tariffs. Every US tariff will spook the fuck out of anybody investing in China, while the soybean tariffs have none of the same effect. Also, the farmers won't be affected much, because they are already on corporate welfare (over $2.5 billion in gov't subsidies in 2016 for soybeans alone). They'll find other buyers who pay a bit less and the government will give them another billion to make up the difference."
dwsjcc6,rhythmguy,"So you're missing an important point here. Sure, a 5% tariff might just cause less people to buy a product. But there's a point at which the tariff just stops all purchasing - that might only be 10%, at which point they just buy local goods instead. It doesn't matter how much you raise the tariff after that point. But here's the kicker: the exporter doesn't care if people are still buying the goods at the higher price, so the only effective tariff is one that makes the product completely unappealing.Having more goods to tax absolutely gives the US far, far more leverage."
dwsh6u5,kolgrim88,"No, those companies will be devoured by their competitors with that kind of move. Electronics comes to mind."
dwtg31b,NBA_AK,"I'm curious, couldn't the US theoretically confiscate all the real estate holdings that chinese citizens own in the US? That would be another card that the Chinese government couldn't match as they don't allow foreigners to own property there afaik."
dwu39hn,LATABOM,"That would spook all foreign investors and ruin real estate prices in the country though and Trump and many of his friends are in real estate. Also, property owners have legal protections regardless of nationality. Then you look at American companies manufacturing I China. There are probably more doing so in China than in the USA atm. That's a lot of products and production materials that could be confiscated."
dwsb3yb,WizardSleeves118,That's really interesting given the Chinese motto has been reciprocity and equivalent response. Seems like a pretty clear escalation.
dwsb99n,bittabet,"Well they taxed the exact same dollar amount, it's just that the US doesn't export as much in dollar amounts to China so percentage wise it's a bigger hit. Either way though, this is why there's really no such thing as winning a trade war with tariffs, all the countries that have trade surpluses have those because they simply built up cutting edge industries and exported more goods, not because they tariff incoming goods. Even sillier is the fact that the US/China trade deficit was already shrinking."
dwsbd6f,WizardSleeves118,That's interesting. Do you have a source for the shrinking trade deficit? I couldn't find one in a cursory search.
dwse8wd,tangoliber,"While I don't have a source for him, I wouldn't be surprised. Wealthier countries build bigger trade deficits, and China is becoming wealthier.Some economist would argue that a trade deficit is a good thing because you are essentially getting more value for your money. I've seen it argued that it's not a bad thing because American dollars we send to China can only be re-invested in countries that use the USD... I guess what you are really losing when you have a trade deficit is ownership in your economy...since the profits that come in from that re-invested money will go to the Chinese. But I don't know if there are any consequences of having a problem like that...especially if many of the Chinese super-rich become American citizens down the road.I'm not an expert, but in my opinion, a trade deficit benefits the working class because you have a lower cost of living and stronger job market due to the presence of foreign investment."
dwsefz9,WizardSleeves118,Those are really interesting points.
dwsdrb5,muffinhead2580,You couldn't find it because he made it up. The deficit had been growing steadily for years until a sharp drop in 2017. We don't know whether it would've continued to shrink or not.
dwse9ny,WizardSleeves118,Yeah I suspected as much. [Found this article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-trade-deficit-drops-10-in-february-2017-04-04) about the drop. Pretty interesting; as a pleb I didn't know the trade deficit fluctuated so much. Figured it would be more of a yearly trend.
dwshq90,Teblefer,Also trade deficits don't matter because this isn't the 18th century and we have studied economics for a few hundred years.
dwsfqcd,Cooten,"Not to mention, a tariff is just a tax on your own citizen in disguise. The increased import costs just get passed down to the buyer. Basic goods become more expensive, cost of living increases, and everyone is worse off."
dwshysy,JimmyDean82,"That's any tax. Tax a producer, they raise prices. Tax an employer (unemployment taxes, etc), they lower base compensations. Any tax is just a disguised tax on the consumer and low level employees."
dwsmibg,Cooten,"Well of course, unless there is a lesser or nonexistent demand at the higher price. But I think it's an important distinction because tariffs are typically used to hurt another countries economy. Taxes are used to help a countries own economy through social programs and infrastructure."
dwsh28m,Reelix,"If person A sues you for 1% of their million dollar / month income, and person B sues you for 1% of their minimum wage income, both are equivalent, although the end result is a massive difference. This IS small for China simply due to the sheer quantity of product they export."
dwscyi0,A_Birde,There must be punishment for starting this. I don't agree China should be giving a equivalent response you must give a more severe response to remind countries not to begin these trade wars against China in the future
dwsdj0v,WizardSleeves118,"Well I think tarrifs are kind of a dumb way of doing it, at least the way Trump is going about it. I do think the trade deficit with China and IP theft should be addressed as well as building up manufacturing in the US."
dwsgnzg,Cicute,"It's difficult to discuss the merit of an action when the Trump administration insists on using the most ineffective methods possible. Their approach is muddying the relevant points, as usual."
dwsf061,dalerian,"The challenge is working out who started it.""The one starting this round of tariffs"" is -an- answer, but not the only one. There's enough unfair play going on that anyone can claim to be the aggreived party with some justification.Having said that, I'm not sure that I'd want Mr ""trade wars are easy"" making these decisions on who is wrong and what the appropriate response is."
dwsc7wu,under_bridge_dweller,Is the number or percentage of products really relevant? I would imagine the monetary impact would be the important metric?
dwsct0b,mantou2,"Sorry I wasnt clear before. By half and 10 percent, i meant in monetary terms."
dwshdyq,usuallyusemyname,"Yes, but because we already have a trade defecit, isn't our 10% potentially more damaging to them? As a biz owner who sees their very small brand knocked off constantly by China/Amazon, I personally think something had to be done so I'm glad Trump is taking some action against China. I do worry that he didn't have a plan in place before starting this though. I think it's safe to say he probably didn't. I think the ""plan"" was likely the TPP, right?"
dwt4lpn,Tantric989,"Trade deficits are stupid terms that don't mean anything to any economist worth their salt. I have a trade deficit with my grocery store, because I spend money on them and don't actually give them anything. It's 100% imports and 0% exports. Massive trade deficit. Meanwhile, I'm well in the green with my job, where my export is labor and I do not import anything because I don't buy their products. When you expand that to countries, it's not a problem to import from cheap countries and export to rich ones. We absolutely should have deficits with countries like China and Mexico, because we make it up by having trade surpluses elsewhere."
dwtegor,usuallyusemyname,"I totally get that and your explanation is great. However, with a biz like Amazon, for example, a foreign seller (china for example) ships their products directly to Amazon and when the foreign seller sells the product, Amazon ships it for them. We use to hate WalMart because everything was made in China, right? Well, at-least then it was a US company marking up the product that was manufactured for dirt cheap in China. So most of the money stayed here. Because the foreign sellers are now the ones marking it up, only 15% (Amazons fee) is staying in the US. That can't be good. And as a small US biz owner, I can confidently say that every time I launch a new product that gets merely 5-10+ sales a day, it takes 3 months tops for the foreign knock-offs (mostly from China) to flood the market. Once that happens, it's a race to the bottom on price until I can no longer compete and move on to something else. Even when I have trademarks (which by the way, takes up to 8 months so Ive been knocked off well before that happens) it's a full time job reporting these sellers as so many pop up and they just sell it on another username once I get them pulled by Amazon. On top of that, there's no repercussions for them as they're in another country - a small biz can not even legally go after them. They also cheat the system with fake reviews and buying your items and sending them to fake addresses just so they can give you a poor review and also get a refund by Amazon. It's nuts. And any Amazon retailer can attest to everything I just said - it's well known. I am a TINY biz and every retailer in the US now deals with this. More and more ppl buy everything on Amazon and I'm pretty sure that between them and China, our country is in serious trouble if we don't do something. And they're violating tech IP now so our one advantage of Silicon Valley doesn't seem so solid anymore. I'm not an economist and am speaking purely as a biz owner but I think tariffs are the only option. I know our president is an idiot and I mostly can't stand him like everyone else but I would have wanted Bernie to do the same (and way more). Maybe it's misguided but our trade deficit currently feels like a transfer of wealth from the US to China. I was anti TPP but in hindsight, maybe that should have happened because I'm not sure we're ready for this trade war with China. Does anyone have a solution that doesn't involve giving China a free pass?"
dwsgy9z,jabudi,Nobody knew that not starting a trade war would be so hard!
dwsj4g5,rhythmguy,Sounds like China has a lot more left to lose. I don't think Trump will blink here.We can't act like China hasn't been fucking with the global economy and US economy in particular. The US economy has been ravaged by China.
dwsjf73,thedracle,"I.E: If the U.S. were to tit for tat 50% of Chinese imports, it would mean a figure of 192 billion dollars.China doesn't even have 192 billion dollars of U.S imports to target."
dwsjleo,Cinimi,"In terms if economic value, they are similar... it's just that the US import way more stuff from China than vice versa."
dwscrb9,Thuren,"Isn't it relevant that Trump's tariff is only about 10% of total Chinese exports to the US while Chinas is 50%? This should mean that Trump can go much further while China can't do that much more.I.e. if exports are more important than imports politically, a complete trade stop would hurt China 5 times worse, simplistically speaking."
dwsdosu,Niess,Just because it represents half doesn't mean they can't double down on those making it when worse.You can also do an even worse tactic once you run out of tariffs. You can reduce tariffs on other countries and create new free trade deals to change where the products are being made for your country.Want planes? Free trade with Europe on them.Want electric cars? Free trade with Europe on them.The funny thing about what is happening right now is your should actually do free trades as the first step not the second step as it hurts worse and doesn't get your own people hurt I'm the cross fire... But it doesn't look as sexy.
dwshreg,Xyoloswag420blazeitX,"Eh, these numbers are pretty meaningless without context. 10% of Chinese exports is a lot more than 50% of US exports I would imagine.That also mean we have the implied threat of things getting 9x worse for them whole they can only threaten to make things twice as bad for us. I have mixed opinions on the whole ordeal but it is important to at least discuss it in proper context.Edit: holy fuck, I get downvoted for stating objective facts. This subreddit is lost, not even interested in hosting discussion. Later."
dwsebbn,peptide_ring,"That's what happens when you start a trade war. I'm certain there are good reasons for the USA to be angry with China, but I question how thought through this strategy is."
dwsi6cs,,"That goes to show you why our trade is so unbalanced. If our exports are perhaps 200ish products, yet we import 10,000 from China, that means China is most likely fulfilling their domestic market. America ought to start doing the same thing. Made in USA used to be a world class stamp of quality and durability, and considered prime products for the most part. It's time we start making everything in USA again."

dwsknnx,Bob_has_bitch_tits,Surprised we still even *make* anything to sell.
dwskq1s,fibonacciii,"What? It's only applied on 50 Billion dollars worth of trade, which is about 0.3% of US GDP. What people are worried about is escalation. If Trump is smart, he will back down from escalating this."
dwsl1kt,asadddler,"I read somewhere that America's exports only constitute 9% of the total economy which isn't that much. We can be self sustainable. On the other hand, China is an exporting economy and their entire economy relies on selling goods to other countries. We need to stop China from using unfair trade practices and this trade war will hurt them way more than us."

The gap is still big, but not by five times, more like twice as much of an impact according to the figures here from 2016 https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/china-mongolia-taiwan/peoples-republic-chinaEdit: It's also important to consider the proportion of exports to total output. Roughly 1/6th of China's economy is exports whereas they only make up ~7% of the US's (just using Wikipedia's statistics for their economies)."

dwsrhyr,WhosUrBuddiee,It's an estimated 50 billion in tariffs for each.

dwsfdyq,clev3rbanana,"For real though, what you said is somewhat bullshit. From what I'm reading, dialectical materialism makes sense. Indeed, everything is physical (in some form) and plenty of things go against each other. The way we produce things and do work shapes our culture. That's simple enough.That doesn't justify full communism or socialism, particularly because of its impracticality. If I could choose a communist utopia right now, sign me the fuck up. An entirely communist/socialist nation is very likely to fail though, as they're often coupled with tyrannical dictatorships who do have class division while pretending they do not and hold certain people as more important, making the inequality actually even more glaring than in capitalism/democracy.Democracies have proven to work, and capitalism, with all its flaws when unbridled in assuring a fair chance and good life to everyone, it's been successful as of late. To improve the situation of the ""proletariat,"" select socialist policies or institutions can be put in place. These are things already in a capitalist U.S. like taxpayer funded highways, bridges, other infrastructure, and schools, and welfare programs. A step up would be single payer universal healthcare, and as automation steps up, universal basic income. As compared to this more realistic goal (already in place in various Scandinavian countries), why is socialism/communism better?"

dwt3utt,clev3rbanana,"I'm not a communist dude, and I didn't construct my worldview from memes. The dialectical materialism thing was something that one guy whose comment was removed mentioned and I was discussing that with him, as well as the fact that he said ""socialism is the inevitable future, so we should give up"" or something, a statement with which I disagree. Admittedly, on dialectical materialism, I only read a few websites that appeared after googling that so I didn't even pretend to be well-versed on it; I simply saw that it was the opposite of idealism, doesn't allow for non-physical existence like colonialism being because God wanted it that way as opposed to the underlying cause of conflict with resources and human innate desire to acquire more land. It's more straight forward from what I read, but I genuinely don't know how communism goes into play with it so the guy lost me on the connection. I literally have never visited the subs you listed, so you pulled that out of your ass or something.

dwsfe3x,shabby47,"Start with the Dow Futures for the premarket numbers. These show what investors are betting the market will be at some point in the future. Then at 9:30, the real numbers for today come in when trading starts. A good place to go is yahoo finance. They have the futures (mini Dow) up now and switch over at 9:30 to the DJI. The thing is that futures generally trade pretty close to the previous day's close, which was 24033 yesterday. So it is rare to see them down 544 pts (2.3%) at the moment. Also, the value of the futures rarely matches what happens in a trading day, so it is likely the opening will be much lower than the 544 points and may drop or rise from there. It's even possible the day will close up and this is all just premarket hysteria."

dws9yw3,thijser2,Yhea that also works but if you are worried about the US economy taking a hit buying Euros now is likely a good investment so that you can go back to dollars once they hit a real low (or at least to ensure you will have a livable pension should that happen).It's the difference between what you do now (sell still valuable stock and get rid of currency while it still holds relative value) and what you do in the future (buy now under valued stock in a now under valued currency). The trick is knowing when the switch between one strategy and the other happens.

dwsm6ps,thomshouse,You're looking at current values. They are forecasting what will happen under a trade war in full swing.
dwsugs2,Goodbot9000,"If you predict economic doom every month until it happens (which it inevitably will, since the economy is cyclical) were you actually right all along? No. Timing matters. If inflation is increasing, metals will increase in price, because they are a hedge against inflation. It's not predictive of anything, it's reactionary. Here's a forecast: The Fed has announced that it will raise rates either 4 times, or 5 times, this year. This is to combat inflation from QE and 0% interest rates during Obama's entire presidency. We are already in an inflationary period, and the fed knows it. Combine this with the fact that we issued tons of T-Bills for our government spending (during an already inflationary period). We really needed to chill on our spending, not make it worse, if we wanted to smoothly come out of this economic expansionary period. Because of this, the fed will likely need to raise interest rates either higher, or more often, than predicted this year, leading to falling incomes, and more failure to repay debt.They key insight here is that we aren't entering a expansionary economic cycle, we are exiting one, which means the central bank will enact deflationary measures, rather than inflationary ones. What this means in practice is that, if employment and GDP drop, inflation will as well as a result of implemented policy. Which means that, even when we enter a recession (which we will) stagflation will not occur. QE **really** fucked up the economic cycle in an unnatural way. instead of smoothing a deleveraging that needed to occur, it prevented it all together. While this means that the next crash will likely be worse than anything that came before it, it is not a reason to forecast stagflation.TL:DR - the logic doesn't make sense looking at forward values, current values, or past values. This is because he doesn't understand what stagflation is, or what circumstances allow it to occur."
dwt24yd,vermiliondit,"> If you predict economic doom every month until it happens (which it inevitably will, since the economy is cyclical) were you actually right all along? No. Timing matters.> Ha, this is me. Have been stockpiling cash for the last 2 years, sold out all my stock holdings last July, and am just waiting for the collapse. Shillers PE ratio at 34+, second highest of all time, higher than black tuesday, higher than 2008 crash. Only lower than the peak of the 1999 tech bubble. Average over the last 100 years is a 17, and we are more than double that. Stocks prices are rising far far faster than earning growth can support. When it comes down, I will be so stoked to snatch up everything I can at a discount. If I am wrong, eh, whatever, my money is getting devalued at ~3% a year, so be it."
dwt64o8,Goodbot9000,"I don't think P/E ratio is a good indicator on it's own. While low P/E stocks certainly can represent under valued situations, high P/E could also represent the market pricing in higher earnings growth. if you are expecting a crash, why not hold government bonds? Or an all weather portfolio composition? 30% stocks, 40% long term bonds, 15% 7-10 year notes, 7.5% gold, and 7.5% commodities? You sacrifice upside, but you generally do well in low growth, low inflation environments as well. You could even split some of the bonds into TIPS to gain further protection against inflation fears, if you think it's going to be an issue soon. Holding cash that you don't need for an emergency doesn't make sense imo. You should never pay to hold wealth you worked hard for. Although, I have no clue what's going on. The more I learn, the more certain I am of that, lol. EDIT: formatting is hard"
dwt8dbl,vermiliondit,"With the P/E, I agree with individual stocks 100%. I had most of my money invested in solar/green energy companies that had negative earnings most quarters, but were positioned for positive growth. The P/E of the entire S&P rising like it has been is what worries me. It is not like every company was undervalued or is pricing in future growth. The growth strikes me as unsustainable. I don't want bonds that I am locked into, as I want to be liquid for deep discounts in the case of a crash. I know I could sell the bonds, but spreads are so wide with them that I just don't think it is worth it for me as a retail buyer on the secondhand market. It may just be that I am a total bear period, but I cannot see the US market not crashing by 40% or more in the next year. For that reason, I do not see it as paying money to hold wealth personally. Again though, decent chance I am wrong, but that is a gamble I am willing to take. Maybe watching my parents buy a house in 2007 made me super risk adverse in that way."
dwtb6km,Goodbot9000,">It is not like every company was undervalued or is pricing in future growth. The growth strikes me as unsustainable.I took an interest in this as well. I think it's index etf's personally. The good news is that if a company can't sustain the torrid pace of growth in these indices, it falls out all together, and the company takes a substantial price hit just because of that. Talking companies at the bottom of the S&P500 and the Nasdaq. >Maybe watching my parents buy a house in 2007 made me super risk adverse in that way.That would do it!

Why?. 1) People can only pay so much, be it a high principle with little interest, or a small principle with a lot of interest.2) high interest rates poison the market to flippers- they don't get their capital back, as a bigger portion of their monthly payment is to interest, and not recovered capital. Thus, there are more houses to choose from, since buyers aren't competing with flippers, and banks/ hedge funds."
dwsk4m7,hkeyplay16,"High interest rates will make homes less affordable, possibly reducing prices initially, but high inflation on all things takes away everything you have saved. Assets with a fixed or limited supply will rise in value, and the value of any cash you were saving to buy your home will buy less and less as months go by.You will wish you had already purchased a home or some land. Maybe Bitcoin and gold would be a good safe haven.I suppose if you already have half the cash value of the home and interest rates quickly rise to 15% with in a month, you might be able to buy with cash before values continue to rise again, but it would be short-lived."

dwsh10c,etcimon,"Every crash in this credit leveraged economy is a [deflationary trap](https://bizfluent.com/facts-6900807-deflation-trap-.html). Everyone has a tight debt to assets ratio so when the assets value fall the debt is left exposed without collateral. Money will be scarce because nobody will have any left to pay those margin calls. Even those that keep lots of cash also have huge debt and assets. Basically, it's back to the 50s for manufacturing (just like trump was wishing for) but with a plot wist: the purchasing power of a dollar is also going back to the 50s"

dwsgl8y,metarugia,"Wait, the market can crash in the other direction?"
dwsl6qi,hkeyplay16,"China holds and continues to buy a lot of US debt. If they stop, we will have to raise interest rates significantly just to sell enough new treasuries to service our existing debt and keep the government running. With higher interest rates we will have to sell even more treasuries in the future just to service those debts, and it becomes a nasty cycle.We will then be faced with a choice of either cutting spending massively, which might lead to a deflationary crash, or continue forward on the same path, which could lead to rampant inflation which cannot be stopped. It will take everything you have or might have had, with the exception of some things like land, which do well in high inflation."
dwsk2p7,funkyonion,Deflation hurts worse
dwskmhg,hkeyplay16,"Think again. Deflation stunts or reverses economic growth. It takes away what you might have had. Inflation wipes out the value of what you have already saved, in addition to taking what you might earn in the future.Deflation is temporary. Market forces always kick in and the economy starts moving again. Inflation on the other hand tends to feed itself. When it turns into runaway inflation, prices rise much more quickly than incomes and eventually the you either end up with monetary/budgetary policies which stunt growth for the foreseeable future, or the currency has to be re-based as Germany did after WWII. The only reason Germany's economy was able to come back so quickly is because much of their debt was forgiven.Do you think China will be willing to forgive our debt if the trade war heats up?"

dwsnrw4,jimmycorn24,In the grand scheme though... inflation hurts the people holding the money and helps the people in debt. Hmmm... hmmmm... how bout that to break down this wealth gap a little? (Fully recognizing that the wealthy also hold appreciating assets)
dwss432,hkeyplay16,"It only helps people who are in debt with fixed interest rates. Variable rate mortgages, student loans, and credit card debts would cause major pain.There are winners and losers, but mostly losers in high inflation."
dwsyad3,jimmycorn24,Are student loans generally variable? That really sucks. Didn't realize that one.
dwt1ylm,hkeyplay16,"It depends on the loan. Mine are about 2/3 variable and 1/3 fixed. I can refinance them all to a fixed rate, but the interest rate would go up anyway if I did that, so I'm hoping I can pay them off before the rates get too high."
dwtpyww,Tom_Zarek,we had to drop interest rates to 0 to keep the economy from **deflating** last time.
dwtrdy9,hkeyplay16,"That's because it was caused by a liquidity crisis. Banks were over-leveraged on over-priced, risky assets. When asset prices stopped rising, people couldn't pay and the banks didn't have cash to lend. They were insolvent.It would be a different situation if China decides to stop buying US treasuries. It would almost certainly lead to higher inflation. We would then have an excess of US dollars being printed and no one to sell them to unless we jack up the interest rates. It's possible that this could stunt the economy and cause deflation, but more than likely our government will be forced to either keep printing money until the USD is worthless, or ask for other countries to pretty please forgive some of our debt so that we can stop dragging down the world economy."

dwsilv6,LandOfTheLostPass,"While I do think we're somewhere in the middle of a housing price bubble, again; you can still do pretty well if you are willing to commute. And even when prices are down, anything close to DC is still expensive. I was looking for a house back in 2010 and the only way to stay under half a million for a detached, single family home was by going pretty far south on the I-95 corridor or out west along I-66. And I suspect with the Silver Line expansion, that western corridor has gotten even more expensive.

dwslfww,LandOfTheLostPass,"> i'm looking at a townhouse since it's all that's available for around 400Fuck, that's insane. IIRC, when I was looking back in 2010, a single family home in Sterling Park (one of the areas we looked at) was in the $350-ish range. It wasn't until you got into Fairfax that things got that bad. And then prices seemed to go up exponentially as you got closer to DC. Granted, we ended up buying down near Fredericksburg and got a 3BR/2BA house for $150k. It was a foreclosure and out in the sticks a bit; but, with a $850/mo mortgage, it was worth it. Though, that commute did wear on me enough eventually to find a job closer to home. Have you looked south along the VRE lines for possible places to buy? It's one of the reasons we ended up near Fredericksburg.

dwsh3ob,Marokiii,Knowing how much I need to save and howuch I need in returns doesn't relieve anxiety when whenever Trump opens twitter lately he obliterates all the returns I've made so far. In fact knowing what I need and historically should be getting with these investment funds just increases anxiety since now I see how he's fucking things up. I'm young. So I'm not worrying. Dips and even crashes don't mean much to me in the long run.
dwshj4i,Shaqattaq69,"Here's what I mean. I'm 33, I want to retire at 65. My wife and I have to save about 500 dollars a month and get an annual return of 5%. Am I thrilled that trump seems hell bent on tanking the markets? Nope. But I do know that all I need is to return 5% a year. If I don't get that for a prolonged period of time then I either 1) change my retirement goal or 2) add more money or 3) both. Knowing the end result helps. Also, partnering with a fee based advisor helps prevent me from making emotional decisions."
dwsq981,Marokiii,"Adding more money doesn't really work though. If it was just my contributions I was needing to retire on than I wouldn't be knvesting in the market. I'd just savings account everything. I need the ROE. For retirement my ROE at 4.5% makes up around 35% of my retirement savings after 38 years of investment. It's something like 500k. I don't have the ability to save an extra 500k by retirement. Sure all I need is 4.5%, currently because of Trump i'm at like -3.6%."
dwsupq0,Shaqattaq69,Does adding more money not work because you can't add more?
dwupwvj,Marokiii,"you can add more. but on failing investments adding more money isnt a good idea since any money that you add now is going to lose value as well. adding more money to just slow or lower than return investments can work because while they arent making ROE as much as you hoped they are still in the positive returns. Trump isnt slowing or lowering returns with the things he is saying or doing, hes tanking them."
dwuto6q,Shaqattaq69,"I guess that's where you and I split. Over time, high quality investments with a long term focus will win out. Buying on a systematic basis is also a great way to increase your net worth."

dwsgqnp,Shaqattaq69,"That's not exactly how it works. The market responds based on what they think is going to happen. They thought the tax cuts were going to pass so all last year we saw massive gains due to the speculation. The tariffs don't go into effect for 60 days, yet the market is going to take a dive in anticipation of the tariffs."
dwsh4at,685190685190,This is a misrepresentation of reality. The market rose significantly while they were working out the details of the tax cut because the market is always looking towards the future. The market rose *in expectation* of the tax cuts. So the tax cuts had a massive positive impact on the DOW even once you factor in this minor dip over the last few weeks. I understand you want to shit on Trump regardless if it's based in fact but your insinuation that the market is down as a result of the tax cuts is flat out wrong.
dwtdyym,FriesWithThat,">This is a misrepresentation of reality.Very much so, you chose to ignore the whole part where I said it was priced into the market just to offer a blind defense on Trump.

You hate Trump and you're more concerned with trying to make everything he does into a negative than you are with the truth. Trump has had a huge POSITIVE impact on the stock market. Period, end of story. Whether he's an asshole, racist, or xenophobe is up for debate."
dwtpwqc,FriesWithThat,"> the tax cuts have had a huge POSITIVE impact on the DOWI just mentioned the fact that the DOW is down since the tax cuts, and let's assume that most of that was priced in for a while with the assumption that the GOP was going to pass them.

You appear to be a big fan of *both* GOP ""tax reform"" and Trump's ""pro-business"" economic policies and, like Trump, are only make the positive correlations. Nevermind the current volatility, has long term stability been added to the market by cutting regulations and protections? Are analysts still uniformly bullish on the market?>Trump has had a huge POSITIVE impact on the stock market. PeriodPeriod? You mean except for the NEGATIVE impacts directly attributable to his policies, unpredictable behavior, and personal grievance tweets?Why do you sound like Sean Spicer arguing over Trump having the biggest inauguration crowd ever, Period!

dwsfdv3,Athrowawayinmay,We've been in a historical bull market (growing market; historical for how long it's been) since just about 2010. The entire market has grown over 30% in the past 8 years. People think it's due for a major correction (because no bull market has been longer). It looks like Trump is making sure that happens.
dwsfs9v,Azurenightsky,"> It looks like Trump is making sure that happens.I'm curious to know how exactly one president is capable of having all this power, but only when it's the person you don't like or who isn't part of your tribe. Otherwise, it's totally not his fault. See: Obama's average growth never breaking 3% Among many other biases in place around these parts."
dwsh1ql,Athrowawayinmay,">>I'm curious to know how exactly one president is capable of having all this power, but only when it's the person you don't like or who isn't part of your tribe. When he actually uses a presidential power to cause the fucking problem. I mean seriously... are you stupid?The value of the dollar has fallen over 10% since this trade war got started. The market has dropped from 26k to 24k since Trump first started claiming he was going to start a trade war with pre-market trading up to 500 points down today alone. Trump actually started the trade war. **Trump enacted the tarrifs** (just as he claimed he would, the very claim that already had the market in tumult). **Tarrifs are one of the few things he actually CAN do all by himself with presidential power and no oversight by congress.**Trump is 100% to blame for the fallout of *his* tarrifs."
dwsh18h,Rottimer,"Because slapping tariffs on intermediate goods is a great way to start a trade war, reduce consumption and profit margin while raising prices on a large swath of industries. Literally had Trump not done this, the markets would not be down. Had Trump not been talking shit about Amazon the last couple of weeks, it's price wouldn't be down 5%When presidents act normally, or rather, reasonably, they don't have much impact on the market. When they act erratically, and specifically ignore expert advice to implement policy that is, at best, misguided, markets will react.Remember the night Trump won. Futures dropped by almost 1000 points, because people were worried about shot like this. By morning most investors remembered that Republicans were in a position to give them a huge tax cut. But I'm guessing that many CEOs would give up the tax cut if he would stop doing shit like this. After all, they were already making excellent money before the tax cut."

dwsdbi0,Lollasaurusrex,"I was using a set of about 15 high dividend mutual funds as my ""short to mid term savings account"" essentially. Was building up nest egg money for a house down payment there. The increased volatility, threats of trade war, and other poor market indicators (in my lay person views) made me decide to move it out since I am probably within 12 months of making moves to buy a property at this point. Beat keeping it in checking/savings. I didn't touch my 401k funds, obviously. I am 32, so the only way investing in my 401k and keeping the funds there turns out to be a bad move is if it turns out ammo and bottle caps were the only smart investment."
dwse4vh,Kdayz,Yeah that's what I figured. Not really a great idea to keep mutual funds as your savings account but what do I know. Just a Joe shmo working 9_5
dwsfdjf,Lollasaurusrex,"It wasn't *really* my savings account, I have a separate emergency fund. Essentially 1/3 money in retirement accounts, 1/3 in short/midterm investments, and 1/3 emergency fund/liquid assets.

dwsdh2d,Paydro70,"Technically, a majority of Americans own some stocks. ""Very much"" is subjective, but when you consider all the people with retirement savings in 401k and IRA, I'm sure it's important to a lot of them.True that it doesn't signify the rest of the economy is tanking, but it's not just the 1% who suffer if the market drops."
dwskxfv,UghImRegistered,Anybody that is saving for retirement (and is not imminently retiring) is likely invested heavily in the market. Almost all growth mutual funds are 80%+ stocks.
dwshkvu,Rottimer,"It's a future indicator. Investors are trading on what they think will happen with the value of a company. When the DJIA, S&P500, and NASDAQ drop significantly over time, investors believe that there will a down economy in the coming weeks and months.One day or even one week correction isn't much to worry about. But if you get several days like this with no equivalent rebound, expect a shitstorm to follow with employment, wages, etc."
dwsprbc,from_dust,Most Americans livelihood is directly connected to the success of the stock market. Anyone saving for retirement is impacted. Beyond that this isn't just a stock market issue. Inflation is starting to creep into the picture. That is a *very* bad combination.
dwsq0aq,Sands43,"No. The stock market is a secondary market for the company you work at. If your company stock tanks, the only real impact would be for a merger. Particularly if the underlying core indicators of that company remain unchanged. A depressed stock market only impacts IPOs for companies trying to raise capital - but that is only one of several ways they can do that.The market *is* a general indicator of the relative health of the economy - but only if there is a long term trend one way or the other. The connection between the stock market and the economy as a whole is elastic, at best."
dwt01vj,from_dust,What do you think your 401K is doing to gain money? your IRA? Were you around for the recession in 2008? i was. A tanking stock market impacts individuals.

dwt52q0,Luph,Trump should have been disqualified from the Presidency the moment he said that China was part of TPP in a national debate.
dwsq6oj,TIGHazard,"The TPP had some pretty bad provisions in it though. Mainly the Investor-state dispute settlement.> ISDS would allow foreign companies to challenge another countries laws — and potentially to pick up huge payouts from taxpayers — without ever stepping foot in said countries court. Here's how it would work. Imagine that the United States bans a toxic chemical that is often added to gasoline because of its health and environmental consequences. If a foreign company that makes the toxic chemical opposes the law, it would normally have to challenge it in a U.S. court. But with ISDS, the company could skip the U.S. courts and go before an international panel of arbitrators, who would be selected by the very multinational corporations who would profit. If the company won, the ruling couldn't be challenged in U.S. courts, and the arbitration panel could require American taxpayers to cough up millions — and even billions — of dollars in damages."

Yes I underestimated the US exports to Asia but having said that:[This](http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/?country=undefined&partner=undefined&product=1763&productClass=HS&startYear=undefined&target=Product&year=2014) gives you an overview of the biggest car exporter countries and yes, the US are in 3rd place but behind Germany and Japan which together only have around [half the GDP PPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)) of the US. And yes, the US still produce a lot of cars but when you take take their share of exports from above and [the graphs here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry#World_motor_vehicle_production) you can see that by relatively to their market share of cars produced their exports lack severely which means that US cars are relatively far less in demand internationally, given that they are in exports outmatched by Germany and Japan about 1:4(.3).[Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Global_imports_and_exports_of_cars.png) another graph [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_the_United_States) which paints a similiar picture (the US aren't exporting that many cars), sadly imports aren't distinguished in any way. And in the same article you can see how the share of imported cars in the US market [steadily grows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Imported_cars_as_a_percent_of_vehicles_sold_in_the_US.png) and is now at around 25% which still isn't that high but shows once more where US cars are going or rather not going - the US only export around 13% of their own car market (by value) in cars while importing somewhere around 25% (slowly growing).I mean the biggest story propably still is the explosive growth of cars produced in China. I have trouble finding good statistics here but [this](https://asia.nikkei.com/var/site_cache/storage/images/node_43/node_51/2015/201504/20150407/20150409-chinas-car-market-pie/2580272-1-eng-GB/20150409-Chinas-car-market-pie_article_main_image.png) is quite interesting. I'm not an expert but it seems like China going the reverse path of US when it comes to cars...the share of cars manufactured domestically by Chinese manufacturers is growing and presumebly they will eventually start exporting more, while the US see a (slowly) declining share of domestically produced cars and are increasingly less dominant internationally."

dwsvg0a,albic7,"It's a combination of yield and price. It's a guarantee of a revenue level at the coverage level you choose. The government doesn't just pay out farmers anymore. They subsidize lower levels of crop insurance, but you as a producer pay majority at higher (profit making) levels. Ex. If your historic average on corn is 150 bushels/acre and you pick 80% coverage your revenue guarantee is 120 bu/acre x price (one set in Feb, one set in the fall, your guarantee is the higher and if fall price is lower you use that to calculate a claim)Government nearly pays all at 50% coverage - because that level will almost never pay, but at that 80% you're gonna pay about 4x or so of the 50% level. Insurance isn't really a money maker for farmers, it's a security blanket. Plus if you need it every year it goes into a spiral of diminishing returns as a bad year lowers your average and then your guarantee. Source: Am a farmer and crop insurance adjuster"

dwt7m6z,x4Hx_Famine,Woah! TIL. Thank you for such a detailed yet concise explanation on the topic.
dwsvlyw,BowlingShoeSalesman,"No. The only subsidy right now is for crop insurance. It's based on your average production history and spring and fall price for grain. If we have a crop failure it will kick in, but if we have average or good production the price alone probably wont trigger a payment. The insurance is still an out of pocket expense. The government does pay a portion of it.I'm in Iowa, corn and soy farmers, as a state we don't take in more insurance claim payments than what our premiums are. If you look at southern states, on average they take in more on claims than their premiums cost. It's all about representation in DC."

The more currency that's held outside of your country can hurt you. If China decided to sell all of our currency they hold, it would make the value of our dollars lower, which in turn causes inflation to rise and only widens the trade deficit. That being said....trade wars are still not usually successful and end up being a losing proposition. The biggest risk to China is them losing ground of selling to one of the largest economies in the world."
dwsyzo0,HebrewHamm3r,"China can sell anywhere else, though. This would only have work if we had a partnership of some kind where we could apply pressure from many large economies at once. Like a trans pacific partnership or something.Anyway, this isn't even really about the deficit. It's about pandering to his base of people who, by all rights, deserve to be forgotten and left behind"
dwszjlo,TomBradysmom,"I have to disagree that they deserve to be forgotten and left behind....You may not agree with their ideas and politics, their beliefs and religion but choosing to forsake one group or punish one group because of it is exactly what prepuates this mess further republicans did it during Obama's term and now democrats are doing it during trumps. America isn't about that, it's about (or was) taking the poor, weak, and sick and giving them a chance to lead truly better lives. How can that happen if it comes at the expense of one group or another? Idk. It's a complicated subject, I just feel like an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. At the end of the day, we all have to realize that whether we like it or not, we all share this country and this world. And petty tit for tat bullshit just further ruins it and makes the mess our children inherit that much worse."

dwso5uw,ojosdemapache,"30 points down right now. Prices will remain lower if the trade war actually sparks, but you will see much more profitable basis in your physical price."
dwsopmh,LoreChano,"My first comment was more of a joke, I'm no marked expert, but I think it's too soon to assume anything. Prices will get lower for now because buyers will need time to think about what will be their next move. Also remember that international price isn't always the one that reaches the productors, there are way too many variables."
dwsp0w9,ojosdemapache,"Actually I wasn't even disagreeing with you, just clarifying that since soybeans have an international price based in Chicago, the actual commodity price will probably be lower (for everyone) but Brazilians will see a bigger profit in transporting the soybeans to China. US=Price-(Transport+tariff) Brazil=Price-Transport"
dwsidai,JaFFsTer,"Isn't this going to mean the price drops or remains the same, since we are gunna flood other markets with our soy?"

dwsm7vw,JaFFsTer,Gotcha
dwsj4p0,LoreChano,"Brazil doesn't buy soy, it exports mostly to China. China is the largest buyer of soy in the world. Since they are buying less from the US, they will be buying more from Brazil. Brazil is (unfortunately) a very closed economy, we rarely buy soy, so the price here only goes down when we have a hight production or when China stops buying it.This is only the situation of agricultural products, when it's about industrialized goods it's a whole other story."
dwsilwr,nekoazelf,The other markets will implement tariffs of their own to protect local producers/manufacturers and to ensure that their own market isn't simply flooded by cheap goods being dumped.
dwsocll,ojosdemapache,CBOT prices will be lower but Brazilian beans will have much more profitable basis (cost of logistics) for their producers.

dwsn7cw,LoreChano,"You mean people buying other oilseeds such as Canola or sunflower, that are not being taxed by neither government? It's possible. I guess we will see how the market adapts to the new commercial envionment."
dwtlb6o,learn1ng,"Understanding that Brazil also supplies China with a large chunk of their soybean needs, can Brazil ramp up enough to replace US' soybean supply?"
dwtoeqi,LoreChano,"It will not, that's why the price is going to increse. Brazil produces arround the same ammount of soybean than the US (deppends on the year), but will not be able too keep up with the demand, so prices increase."

So if no living organism there is capable of registering the vibrations, it simply will be vibrations.Anyways that is besides the point. I don't think this is the best example to use here for your argument.Better one IMO would be ""if you are blind does that mean there is no light?""Light clearly still exists if you are blind, it doesn't need you to be able to register for it to exist. That is opposite of sound. If you are deaf it is just vibrations. You don't need to exist for the vibrations to exist, but you need to be able to register the vibrations with your ears and brains for sound to exist since it entirely based on perception."

It's not a disease or a virus or something outside of your control. I don't really feel I get offended by much of anything so I am just trying to get a better understanding. To go further. If I find that you chewing with your mouth open is offensive, do I have the right to stop you from chewing with your mouth open? I wouldn't think so. I do have the right to ask you to please stop. At which point you have the option to take into consideration how I feel or not to. If you decide to continue chewing with your mouth open I now have two options. I can continue to be offended and let that affect the way I feel or go about my day and not be offended by it any longer because, should I really allow it to?Understand that what I am referring to is not the same as someone harassing someone maliciously.

dwsh3hm,FartTurbine,"This topic is very annoying to discuss due to how different people perceive offensiveness differently, but I would argue that normalized vulgar words become inherently less offensive due to losing their shock value."
dwshbf4,Wazula42,"Depends. Sometimes they only lose their shock value inside a broader demographic but retain it in a smaller or different one (i.e., how the Confederate battle flag is as normal as beige wallpaper in the south but to black Americans it can often look like a ""Klansmen lives here"" sign).Ideally this would open up discussions about how no one interpretation of a symbol is ever ""correct"", that symbols change meaning rapidly over time and geography and all perspectives should be considered when assessing cultural taste. In practice, it means a lot of people shouting at each other and making strawmen."
dwsnfr6,catofillomens,"Good. If we normalize offensive words, it also loses power to offend."
dwsyqr0,Tfish,"So, good? Now the word isn't offensive anymore because it's lost its meaning."
dwt2jau,Wazula42,"Sometimes it just normalizes the bigotry the word represents and diminishes the opinions of those harmed by it.Take the confederate flag, for instance. It was barely used during the Civil War and only came into wide use when groups like the KKK began pushing it as a revisionist symbol of white supremacy. Gradually the symbol became more of a generic ""southern pride"" symbol, being normalized by people like Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Dukes of Hazzard show. But to black people, the connection to the KKK is still present.""Normalizing"" the flag has done nothing but erase its use as a symbol of treason and white supremacy and diminish the opinions of black people who view it as a direct threat. It hasn't lost its harmful impact, its only polluted the discussion about it."

dwshdlk,Wazula42,"Not saying it's inherently wrong, just trying to point out that your speech has effects beyond your individual opinions and usage."

I can't walk around shouting sieg heil in my group of friends, and when confronted by somebody about the fact that that phrase was a greeting in the Third Reich, get defensive about the fact that I'm not ACTUALLY a nazi, I just like using sieg heil to greet my friends.Choosing to ignore the history of a word doesn't make that word inoffensive, it just makes you insensitive towards others, and perpetuates the use of that word."
dwsoaak,SenorPuff,"There's an entire color gamut of grey you're ignoring to oversimplify language to 'things people consider offensive' and 'you ignoring those things.'Language evolves over time completely differently. I wouldn't be at all surprised if there was a small isolated farming community where the rebellious youths use Nazi language to mock their parents who they think really are radical authoritarians trying to keep them from having fun. Like it's not even hard to think of ways satire and language evolution would work for different groups of people. Your error is in presuming that offense takers determine the meaning of words rather than individuals and their immediate social groups doing so for the vast majority of people. Regional dialects haven't stopped existing. Shit means different things different places. I'm not saying you have license to go out and be an edgelord douche because ""but it's not offensive to me"". I'm saying ""offensive"" is determined predominantly by the social group in which you exist. If the majority of your social interactions do not consider a word or phrase offensive, regardless of the demographics of your social circle, the words you use aren't offensive within that social context. Coming across a random person or two who take offense to something when everyone else doesn't use the word that way in your microcosm doesn't make you offensive. It means you have entirely different subtexts of language."

Seriously, a number of economists have repeatedly pointed out that Trump could be worth double what he claims to be worth if he had taken his father's money and invested it in a moderate growth index fund. But Trump's style is more “bet it all on 00! It's flashy and fun and pays out crazy good on the incredibly unlikely chance we win. So what if we go bankrupt? It's not like I worked for my money or helped this country gain its wealth in any way”"
dwsmjhg,Donquixotte,"I hate to do the comparison, but this is eerily similar to what Hitler did between 1930 and 1942 - a series of huge gambles that had terrible odds by conventional wisdom, both political and military.

dwsuu1u,FizZzyOP,So Trump's casino failings were because of the future? That's crazy how his casinos failed so much earlier than everyone else's casinos in the area...Almost as if the current situation has nothing to do with it.
dwszqzm,_676767676767_,"No its more like Atlantic city was kind of doomed from the beginning. They legalized gambling in the late 70's. During the 80's they tried to turn it into Vegas II but it never really caught on at that level. Most of the casinos (both his and others) had lackluster performance. Then he built the Taj, which was the most expensive casino in the city. It did better, but given how it was financed required several debt restructurings (his bankruptcies) before it was financially viable. At that point the writing was on the wall. Connecticut opened a casino, and Pennsylvania followed suit. Now if you are coming from NY, DC or Philadelphia, you have to pass multiple casinos to get to AC. He actually did do quite a bit to try and boost AC, for example getting Tyson to fight there on several occasions. But alas, it just wasn't to be. As for how it was ""just"" his casinos, the vast majority of his casino operations were in that one basket. Now that a bunch of the casinos have closed the market is smaller, which should help those remaining. Anyhow, the main point is, a casino in AC isn't the money printing operation it might seem like. He did have a good run in the mid-90 (after a restructuring or two) but was hit pretty hard by the downturn and eventually sold off his involvement in those business units. I am not trying to imply he is some kind of sage otherwise, but that was a tough business."

dwspaho,HailSatanLoveHaggis,">The IRS has all of his financials right in front of them every yearIt's pretty naïve to think that Trump has all of his finances available for the IRS to assess, especially after the Panama revelations and the international nature of Trump's portfolio. And *especially* considering his attitude to tax reform and his track-record regarding exploitation of policy loopholes. And besides, Trump hasn't released his tax returns (even though the IRS says he can), so why would Forbes know?It's funny that you should talk about me 'moving the goalposts' (which I didn't do), as that's exactly what you did regarding starting talking about Forbes, then moving to the IRS.>Just a comment ago you were saying...There *is* no proof he is a billionaire. I think Trump's figure is a lie, and I think Forbes has no real idea.>So now you are saying he is one he just isn't as big of one as he claims to be?

Why would I trust a provable compulsive liar and swindler when he says he is a billionaire but won't prove it through the most official channel? Show me some conclusive, concrete evidence that Trump is a billionaire. Not claims, not speculation, not articles guessing. Facts. Then maybe I'll reconsider.>but I don't question their net worth over itI'd imagine that's because it would be rude to. I'm not really comparing Trump to Taylor Swift, or some member of the public.>Is that estimate wrong because the person that made that claim never saw her taxes?It is entirely possible.>What do you think his net worth is and how did you arrive at that figure?I don't know, but considering his penchant for asserting he is things that he isn't, his zeal regarding overturning tax law to favour the ultra-wealthy, his history of frivolous lawsuits, his lack of clarity in most aspects of his business dealing, and his track record of large losses and bad business choices, I'd not be surprised if he was in considerable debt.He might not be, he might have a million bajillion dollars. However I think if he did, he wouldn't miss a chance to prove it considering his monumental ego and seriously questionable legitimacy I the eyes of the world.>So are Obama's college transcripts.Because those are the same thing.

dwsnlu0,Mezmorizor,There's wealthy and then there's WEALTHY. Trump is the latter. Trump was born with so much money that it's literally impossible to lose it all in a lifetime.
dwso4hw,Endless_Vanity,Except people like you are wrong. His own brother died penniless and he inherited the exact same silver spoon.\#gtfoh
dwst4qe,yoshemitzu,"> he inherited the exact same silver spoon.Fred Trump, Jr. had a serious problem with alcohol abuse, and died at age 43 in 1981, almost two decades before Fred Trump, Sr.'s death in 1999. Reportedly, Donald helped Fred, Sr. write his brother out of the will.Which is to say, he didn't ""inherit"" the same as Donald ([as little as $20 million](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5022077/It-s-hell-Trump-said-alcoholic-brother.html) or [as much as $100 million, after selling inherited father's assets](http://www.politifact.com/florida/article/2016/mar/07/did-donald-trump-inherit-100-million/)).I don't want to be naive and focus too much on the word ""inherit,"" though, because I'm assuming you meant that proverbially (i.e., Fred, Jr., ""inherited"" the silver spoon by living in the Trump family). As far as that goes, it may be possible that he had a posh upbringing, but I can't find any evidence that he was unsuccessful (or even tried his hand) as an entrepreneur. As far as I can tell, he never received a ""small loan of a million dollars"" from his father to start a business, like Donald did.He just didn't want to work in Fred, Sr.'s business (and depending on where you look, felt a burdened by his father's pressure to do so), and decided to go fly planes. Some accounts (seemingly Donald himself) say Fred, Jr's wife Linda was destructive influence on him personally, but suffice to say, his premature death and pennilessness seemed to have little to do with his business acumen."

dwtca74,Helicopterpizza,"I'm no Fox news supporter. I'm somebody who is tired of people repeating/spewing thoughtless bs and not getting called on it - nay, even getting upvoted for it!

dwtgks4,sinking-tins,"Just out of curiosity, what do you think about some of the other news networks and their coverage? Which one/s do you think are purely honest for all parties involved and not trying to shape or coerce a viewer's opinion?"
dwtmbqx,oldmanbrownsocks,"I never watch cable news, but I get a lot online. I'm a fan of the NYT and WaPo which I think are both very objective in their news coverage. Editorials/opinion is a different beast. But online, you can hit CNN's front page and MSNBC, Politico, etc, and I get you can see a bias in what stories they think are important, top of the page, bottom of the page, etc but they ALWAYS cover every story. And I honestly don't think CNN is biased against the GOP/President, I think they are biased toward the tabloidy end to attrack readers (so is Fox to an extent, can't go there without one of their top stories being celebrity gossip or small town shock story) But Fox News is the only place where you will see them blatantly not cover objectively major news stories if they are bad for the president. The kind of stories that are on the front page of every network, every print news, down to the local papers that run national stories. I remember the day after McCain's thumbsdown killing health-care repeal it was everywhere, but wholly absent from Fox News. If there is a bad story for the President, Fox News consistently exercises one of the following options:1. Don't cover it, true blackout on the story2. Cover it, but bury it deep in the page3. Cover somebody else talking about it (I.e, Instead of writing the headline ""X Happened"" write ""PERSON Says: X is a made up conspiracy""4. Actually cover it - but this only happens until they can find a suitable quote to go with option 3Sorry for the rant, Fox News is just so blatantly propaganda it blows my mind that anyone defends them. I listen to the Daily Standard podcast everyday, they are conservative but rational. They talk about the actual news, from a conservative perspective, without the latest Hillary conspiracy theory trash. Fox News is much closer to Brietbart than it is to the Weekly Standard."

That's no longer the case, and they're taking the opportunity to steal a large amount of US global economic influence.

dwsdtuo,BigBennP,"I think the ""nobody knew it was so complicated"" will come when jobs are lost due to trade disputes. Protectionism and immigration appear to be a few (the only?) things that Trump seems to believe in other than himself. He's pat buchanan wrapped in the shell of a slimy used car salesman. From his public statements Trump seems to believe that Trade balances (i.e. the US populace buys $100B worth of Chinese stuff and the Chinese populace only buys $50B of US stuff) actually mean something significant, as if a trade deal negotiation actually means the leaders sit down and figure out ""we'll buy 50 horses from you and take 10 iron in exchange"" like you're playing civilization. Trump sees that $50B a year trade balance and because of this incorrect starting point comes to the conclusion ""we're getting ripped off!"" without any further understanding of international trade or how the chinese actually DO cheat on trade deals. Because of this incorrect understanding, he seems to believe that if we have a $50B trade deficit, and we kill all trade with china, we're up $50 Billion and we're ""winning"" even if nothing else happens. In fact, everyone who supplied that $100B in goods from china has to look for other suppliers (only a fraction of which can come from US in short term) and pass prices onto their consumers, and everyone who sold that $50B in goods to China gets killed by retaliation."
dwsflft,Hoodafakizit,"The thing is, trade isn't just about the US and China... there's a lot of other countries as well. Now Trump might look at the China trade deficit and think ""Okay, we hit China with tariffs and the trade deficit will get fixed."" It won't. If the American companies buying stuff from China decide the tariffs make China too expensive, they'll start buying from other (cheap) countries, so instead of having the $50 billion trade defict with one country (and thereby having a little possible leverage), that $50 billion will most likely end up getting split between a dozen other countries instead. There will be no ""Bringing jobs back to America"", there will be no reducing the overall US trade deficit, there will just be splitting it up into pieces so small that nobody will care about it or have any negotiating power to deal with it. Remember: this isn't about China just sending over a bunch of stuff with the aim of destroying US jobs... this is American companies like Walmart and Target and a shitload of others who specifically send buyers to China (and other countries) to find the cheapest manufacturers available"
dwsksyl,WallStFinancier,"It's not even necessarily the cheapest, often they're the best price for a consistent quality product. With more of their manufacturing being specialized their customers here in the US now have to pay more because switching costs to another manufacturer would be too great, not to mention wasting time and money searching for new relationships that may or may not produce a consistent quality product. The layman understanding of the Chinese economy and manufacturing prowess seems to be that they're all a bunch of sweatshops on par with Vietnam or Bangladesh that just steal US r&d and dump the finished product here. And this couldn't be further from the truth."
dwt27kn,xanaxoccasionally,"Yeah, I deal with a bunch of Chinese factories and suppliers.

dwtnsuk,haiapham,"But the individual citizens are buying up all these building as investments. So a paid-off cash-based transaction and not a 30 year mortgage with compounding interest rate. It's speculative in the sense of surrounding infrastructure in development, which is weilded through direction from the government policies. Eventually workers connected to these will move in. Same as retails and businesses. This is large scale urban planning under central planning."

dx4q3mz,BuzzKill722,"my comment its obviously a joke，but since you put it this way i will answer you question more seriously，Yes， Great firewall its actually a big problem towards chinses new generation netizens that including me as well . the very existence of this Great firewall means we have lot limits regading access to foreign websites，such as facebook。we just cant log on to it ， it used to make me very unhappy ，but i had completely different opinion about the Great firewall since i learned how to use the VPN to log on some website that i cant log on under normal conditions，you konw what i found out？too many false negative news and unfounded prejudice towards china and chinese, even some things that meant to overthrow the Chinese government。 History tells us that the people its most Powerful tool to rule and also the easiest to incite。and we both know western world already win the public opinion warfare since second World War。at this stage ，i think there are good reason for Great firewall to exist even the fact its been partially removed。"
dx4ruuj,ManBearPigTrump,"Thank you for sharing your views with me. I do really appreciate it. There really is nobody I can ask about this and I was curious.

dwszkoo,CrucialLogic,"He is targeting the older generations as his core base, he tries to hark back to the ""good ole days"" and it chime's perfectly with what this age group wants - they also vote in the largest numbers for a variety of reasons. They might want it and vote for it, but they never get it."
dwtj7p6,kawag,"As you say, Trump just thinks too small, as with everything else that he does. He's a C-list TV personality who somehow finds himself at state receptions in China, or at the Bastille Day Parade. He has no idea that he's the POTUS.With a calm demeanour and soft power, and the sprawling influence and alliances the US has painstakingly built over generations at his fingertips, he really could change the world how he sees fit. He doesn't understand how the world works - that's why he cut the State Department budget so drastically. That is all the evidence you need that he doesn't understand where America's power truly comes from.Another example: Trump is using the current instability in North Korea as an opportunity to reopen trade deals with South Korea. Like in Germany, their country was split in 2 by the Cold War. Recently, the North made a sudden change and promised to denuclearise and are talking about solidarity and dreaming aloud about a unified Korea. This is HUGE for them.This is like if a guy is down on one knee with a ring out, his girlfriend crying, and you interrupt to ask him to move his car."

dwsemai,reallyfasteddie,Fair is a childish word. The strong do what they want and the weak suffer what they must. Fair never is talked about at the negotiating table. Real Politiks.
dwsfe41,sunset_moonrise,"Yes, they use other words like ""equitable arrangement"". Fuck off."
dwsfolf,reallyfasteddie,Equitable arrangement. Like how a buck an hour employement is fair. Or pollute your enviroment because you have that choice or starve. Sounds fair.
dwsg8c7,sunset_moonrise,"At what point did I say ""Fairness is universal, and requires no effort to maintain""? At what point did I say ""Fairness is the way life typically operates""? Here's a hint: It's not childish to seek fairness, it's childish to assume that it's the way that the world does or doesn't work. Knowing that, I said it nowhere.Now, as to what I actually said:Fair is simply a good system, but requires all parties to be held to it, either by their own intent or by consequence.Stop whining about the unfair things, or about people trying to be fair, and go be fair where you can manage it. It's a good system."
dwsgvg0,reallyfasteddie,What I am saying is fair usually is brought up when it is against your interests but the person bringing up fairness usually has been using unfair practices. It just seems hypocritical now to say its unfair.
dwsi5yn,sunset_moonrise,"Ah. Well, it's good that that's what you meant. However, there is no time to resolve an unfairness (if possible) like the present.Standing up for our interests is important, just as it is important to cease unfair action on our own part. I do think that Trump has a miserable way of doing things, and I'm not really confident that he's (edit: wording) not just destabilizing the nation. But that aside..The poster you responded to:> Well, what would you have us do? Just continue ignoring that China plays unfair in world trade? That's the reality unfortunately..is not far off the mark. China has deeply broken our trade agreements. You know the cheap techie stuff you get off of Amazon for a dime and a cough? A large amount of that was created in the US, stolen, and sold back to us for a lower price. ..not that the US has much ground to stand on regarding holding to trade agreements now, thanks to Trump. But at least he took *some* action on that issue.I swear, most people in the US can't seek fairness without being submissive, and can't hold power without losing their shit and abusing it all over the place."
dwsj6f1,reallyfasteddie,OK. I am Canadian living in China and have very little sympathy for Americans I am afraid. I think a generation or two of America suffering under unfair trade practices mmight get them to agree to rules other than America first kind of bs. It seems like the global business climate will be The strong do what they want...
dwse9nc,Beepbopbopbeepbop,We get fair bananas from the south of the south right?
dwseqlm,yettymurphy,"No, but I was talking about buying. We don't set the price when we purchase, the seller does, and we don't produce bananas. The competition that works to their detriment is from the same region."
dwseva9,Beepbopbopbeepbop,We get fair canned tunas from that kok banging country then??
dwsfagp,yettymurphy,"No but it's the same premise. In that case we're buying something we don't have. The burden of a fair price is on the region that produces it. The problem with China is that they steal our designs and they commoditize every single product into a one-use piece of trash that ends up in a landfill. There is no value on the products they produce, they're just cheaper. At the same time they provide horrible working conditions and destroy the environment all in the name of keeping the factory wheels turning. Americans will buy less Chinese products when tariffs go up, China will not because our products are worth it."
dwsfts4,MythicalSheep,For some products maybe but not others. when you look at the frozen pork market the bar isn't very high in terms of Chinese appetite for quality and there will be quite a few countries out there looking to supply at a rate cheaper than US +tariff. If they are 1/3 total US exports of pork that's a big drop for that sector
dwsgnns,yettymurphy,"You're right the intl commodities will hurt over this. Products that have a global set price which can be sourced elsewhere. For now though it's only between our country and theirs and I think most would be offset by the other. I'm not fully endorsing Trump here, just saying, something needed to be done, the trade war had already started."
dwt7dgp,RainbeeL,"So you use your iPhone only once after you buy it? Most iPhones are built in China. And if you have some basic economy knowledge, you should know you buy something because you need it. If most Americans really think the Chinese products are trash and don't buy them, there is no way that the US sellers will import them."

We buy 5 times more from China than they buy from us, look it up. No reason to be afraid of a trade war with them, but I doubt it will come to that. This is just a step towards holding them more accountable."

dwsemzi,brad4498,"It's the only logical conclusion right? I mean, otherwise it's pretty hard to run a casino into the ground, unless it was never supposed to succeed in the first place. And where better to move funds then through a casino?"
dwsj7vk,Endless_Vanity,"The real logical conconclusion is borrow hundreds of millions to buy casinos knowing they aren't worth anything. Lose a fortune, file for bankruptcy, and enjoy 18 years worth of tax write offs. Leave your lenders with nothing.It's like printing your own money only everyone here insists he's an idiot. When was the last time you printed yourself hundreds of millions?"
dwt5d6y,brad4498,"Arguably, while that does work out to shelter his other income sources, isn't the true best outcome to make hundreds of millions in profits from the casino? I mean in the end aren't actual profits worth more than tax write offs? It's not the dumbest plan ever but at the same time, a $100 million loss only saves 30 million of income tax. Whereas 100 million in profits every year is about 70 million after tax. Wouldn't you rather get a +70 million every year then a +30 million in total? Hypothetical numbers of course but at the end of the day profits are worth more and a casino is about as sure of a business as they come. The house always wins."
dwtfr71,,[deleted]
dwtmbvg,brad4498,Right but 100 million loss is only a 100 million loss. It might take 10 years to lose it all but it is limited in its maximum amount. Profits can be unlimited. Being successful is better than operating at a loss intentionally.

dwt1jlh,wbgraphic,"You're not wrong. Plenty of casinos have gone under here. Most get bought out and re-branded (e.g., Vegas World, Sahara, San Remo), some get imploded (e.g., Hacienda, Landmark).The question is *why* they go under. Competition, market slumps, bad management, or corruption?"
dwt2002,PerfectZeong,Yeah there are plenty of reasons why you can see that a casino fail but people out here are acting like you could be a moron and run one successfully. It doesn't just take not bad management you have to actually be good at running one because it's a very cutthroat business in places like Vegas and AC and everyone is trying to compete.
dwt64bp,brad4498,"Sure they fail. Not that often and generally in an over saturated area like Vegas. AC should have been able to support the Taj. Which begs the question about the how and why it failed. Or like I said, if it was even supposed to succeed in the first place. It could have merely been a conduit for organized crime money laundering and would have been a perfect place and time to do it as technology wasn't as sophisticated yet and all it takes a corrupt regulator or 2 to sign off on false books. Meanwhile, millions of dollars move through it and get washed and put into bank accounts around the world never to be seen again. Maybe don is as clean as they come.

I do not think their military is on the level of the US yet, I question whether their economy is sustainable and I am not sure they will or be able to maintain their military. Also I do not think that China wants the US economy to fail. The other side to that is I do not think the US wants the Chinese economy to fail. All of this seems like pandering to the home teams."
dwsxdi2,SynisterSilence,"China has access to all the same tech as we do, if not more. The future of war is in the technology, not in pure firepower. The big thing China has is a huge army. So even if they aren't as advanced (which I think they are), they have the soldiers to expend. Finance historically hasn't stopped war before. China has been building islands and setting bases up on them while Russia is now moving north across the arctic, since global warming has opened up new naval routes. All signs are pointing to potential conflict."
dwsyksv,ManBearPigTrump,"I agree that technology is a force multiplier but remember the Soviets had great engineers too. They had some great designs. The problem came with the actual maintenance. I feel the same about China. [A US soldiers equipment costs over $17,500 while the Chinese soldiers equipment costs a little over $1,500](https://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2014/12/08/the-minuscule-cost-of-equipping-a-chinese-soldier/). [Fitness of the Chinese military is not nearly as good as us morbidly obese American either.](http://metro.co.uk/2017/08/24/chinese-soldiers-failed-fitness-tests-because-they-are-too-unfit-and-masturbate-too-much-6876635/) Then your last point about Russia is odd. This really has nothing to do with Russia at this point but Russia and China are probably more natural antagonists than the US and China. I do not think China wants conflict with the US nor do I think the US wants conflict with China. We are each great trading partners of the other and if one should fall it would hurt the other."
dwt10ti,SynisterSilence,"In such conflict, the many factories that were once making US goods will be converted to make Chinese military gear or similar products. So production or maintenance should not be an issue for them. And it is much like the American attitude towards things that ""more is better"", when it always isn't. Meaning the average US soldier outfitted with nearly $20k worth of gear doesn't mean much if they are poorly trained. I can't make any guesses on China and Russia's relationship, besides they are both members of BRICS. My guess is that in a tight situation, the ""*communists*"" would stick together against the capitalist (""*fascists*"") -- but that is being conspiratorial. But like I said, any sort of financial loss or gain hasn't always stopped wars from happening before. Because while money matters the most, its not always the reason. Given that Russia hates the US for taking their oil and boundaries, I'd say they are out for revenge. Remember when they said they were going to nuke us from Cuba? Which that in part led to all the problems we're in today. The whole Iran-Contra affair was in response to the cold war. As an American, I'm really hoping we don't go to war. Because if we do, we will get drafted for sure and it will be because of Trump for maximizing instead of minimizing the conflict. But we have been projected to have conflict in South China sea by 2020, so we will see."

I was a US Infantryman and I would never say I was poorly trained and a lot of what I have seen and read supports that. You are missing other points as well. Sure China could convert factories to war production but currently their gear is not as good as their US Counterparts nor do I think they would be able to make that technological jump. Then we have the elephant in the room. China relies on their Oil imports. The US could shut down the Persian Gulf and limit other oil imports. The US can also project power better and probably disrupt internal production as well. The US also has allies and more importantly it has allies in the area. I am not sure if Canada or Mexico would go to bat for China.... You are totally oblivious to the maintenance point but that is fine. >I can't make any guesses on China and Russia's relationship, besides they are both members of BRICS.

That's he's president is just the cultural climax of that... and it's not surprising that it ended the way it did, after 40 years of collapsing wages, dismantled infrastructure and economy, and endless bombardment of how we should hate the other tribes and not focus on actual issues.The ""progress"" of the US in the last 40 years was entirely of the form ""the wealthy are on escape velocity while we're grinding anyone else down into a consistent mush of poverty"".

When looking at a complicated subject like trade it seems simple to say that we should be trading equally, etc.Trump for varying reasons often chooses to go with his gut over expert opinion. He thinks he has a handle on stuff because most people don't want to believe they are just average. Not to mention that he did win the presidency so he might even be a bit above average - though often misguided.This is the naivety that is hurting us. People who make a career out of being a politician know how to manipulate others as a primary skill. Being good at that requires you to have a pretty clear understanding of when you need to substitute someone else's knowledge for your own. Trump's failing here is not recognizing that if he works the experts hard no one will care that he claims most of the credit. That's a huge part of being a good politician and winning both personally and for your constituency."

dwsv439,ChocolateTower,"Hopefully it goes without saying that Illinois only votes Democrat because of Chicago. The rest of the state is corn and soy fields, and those people voted Trump overwhelmingly."
dwsym4n,NabiscoLobstrosity,"It's not just that. Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs affect the unworked stock material - bars, beams, plates, sheet metal, etc - the refined but otherwise raw forms.Every state in the rust belt has a major metal**working** industry, but the metal **making** industry is very small. So the *only* thing those tariffs do is make the raw materials more expensive for the many US metalworkers.Trump's supporters claim that only the foreign metals will get more expensive, but that's not how markets work. The domestic producers of those metals won't keep their prior prices out of the goodness of their hearts, they'll raise prices to at least match the cost of the imports. If anything, they'll also make the imports less common, which creates an additional cost when trying to purchase those materials because that industry operates entirely on bulk and there's a substantial time and manpower cost when arranging the import of materials from a new supplier (not just the process of finding the supplier and making the deal, but also checking and QC'ing the materials as they come in to ensure everything was communicated correctly and the companies are cooperating well) - so by kicking foreign suppliers out of the market, the domestic companies make it much harder for them to come back in.Let me put it this way; if you have a car factory and you stamp metal sheets into door panels, you probably built your machines to do this with sheet steel that is 1/8th inch thick. If you get sheets that are 1/8th inch plus a bit, it breaks your machines; if you get sheets that are 1/8th minus a bit, it breaks your machines. If the alloy is different, it breaks your machines. If you check the thickness (fairly easy, but requires a lot of man-hours) and the alloy composition (a chemical process that is more difficult and much slower) before putting it through your machines, then you avoid breaking the machines. But then you have to send all that metal back, and now you don't have anything to run through your machines at all, so the factory shuts down until you can get new sheet metal. If one of those factories has to shut down for a week, it could go bankrupt from the loss of revenue, failure to deliver on contracts, and damage to its reputation. Some other company is waiting on the delivery of those door panels, and so your problem causes the same problem to their factory too.In industry, it can be hugely expensive and time-consuming to change suppliers, even for a material that is supposedly the same."

dwsg011,PrivatePyle,A tariff on bourbon won't hurt one bit. There is so much demand right here in the US that even if every drop of bourbon released could be sold without any impact on price. The prices have been climbing for years and will continue to do so.
dwsk1z6,aryanoface,"But it shifts the market which could be detrimental. If prices on American whiskey increase in China then Asian Whiskeys become a more attractive option and Asian whiskey's have been taking off for a while now. Short term it might not do much but who's to say that in 10 years, because of this tariff, the most popular whiskey in China is a Japanese or Chinese brand instead of Jack Daniels."

dwskjgt,EntireProperty,So what you're saying is I should buy a still?
dwsn1iw,PrivatePyle,"The problem is, to sell bourbon, you need to invest a lot of money in government regulation, buying the still, the barrels and warehousing to store the stuff. Then you have to make product and let it sit for a few years before selling it. It's a huge start up cost before you can even begin to recoup any of the investment. That's the reason the thriving craft distillery business mostly focuses on selling things like vodka and gin because they can be produced, bottled and sold without the cost of aging. If you feel you have the skill and capital to compete, by all means, buy a still and start producing. I'll be happy to buy some to support a fellow redditor."

dwsdzt3,classicalySarcastic,"It's 5th dimensional, they had to cut a dimension to dumb it down for Trump."
dwse3d6,SlitScan,this board being slightly large than 19x19 isn't in Donnie's favour.
dwsec17,KinglyWeevil,"2D connect 4, at best"
dwsgh27,fizzlefist,"Nah, just regular Go"
dwsd6kd,Postius,"The EU resitrictions ar even more hilarious like that.They are anti trump as well, very specific targeted to specific industries in specific states that hurt trump supporters the most.Kinda hilarious."
dwsdr9j,Mitosis,"These things typically target swing states and states of congressional leaders. There's little good in targeting Georgia, for example, but Florida is a common target as it's an important swing state. Other targets are Wisconsin (Paul Ryan) and California (Nancy Pelosi), for example. They might also hit specific industries that give lots of money."
dwt979b,dvxvdsbsf,"swing states only matter if you plan to run again or value the support of your party though, right? Trumps not afraid of making enemies, as we've seen."
dwse0cu,MrBeardyMan,"The EU did exactly the same to Bush, who then dropped the tariffs."
dwshn1t,puppet_up,Let's see if Trump has the cojones to ever admit a mistake or defeat and try to correct it. My guess is that he doubles-down.
dwsri0j,canadianbacon-eh-tor,Donny: I'm all in.China: *I call*
dwt5053,cultured_banana_slug,Trump won't. He'll just blame democrats. His believers will go along with it and he'll monkey-sling some more shit at the global map and see what sticks.
dwsrtsh,Rafaeliki,It wouldn't make sense for them to do it any other way.
dwst4wi,Gsome90,Фаск ТЯАМР
dwsd1kh,strolpol,It's going to have collateral damage. Illinois went for Hillary and grows a ton of soy and pork. The whole region is going to suffer heavily.
dwsdsqd,Lethena_LoL,"But what districts went for Hillary? The farming ones? Not really. Just the urban and city areas, so the house members from farming districts are going to see their base devastated. Yes, there's some collateral, but for 50b in tariffs, this is extremely precise."
dwse199,TheFlickeringLantern,I remember when I was in Chicago and it was just field after field of soy as far as the eye could see.
dwsg55d,bobloblawdds,You sure? I think all of Chicago's soy comes from that one damn bean.
dwso15m,DontSleep1131,Yeah now Houston's copy-cat Bean can grow them soy too!
dwsee5i,Lethena_LoL,"I suggest you Google a political map and farming map of Illinois, and then cross reference. I would do it for you but I'm on a phone. There's not a ton of crossover."
dwsh0cu,lechuguilla,Economically there is crossover. Good luck guys.
dwsh9dc,Lethena_LoL,"Sure, but who will get hurt first and hardest? There's crossover with the entire country, eventually, unless trump loses support from congress and this absurd trade war is ended. But the first people hurt are those most directly tied to the buttons to be pressed to lose trumps congressional support."
dwskntq,lechuguilla,Not saying that's a bad thing. But we all loose
dwsphit,reverendz,"Not me, I'm tight."
dwse78d,SlitScan,"cities went democratic, rural didn't."
dwseeot,ABCosmos,I assume greater Chicago went for Hillary.
dwshs9r,tomdarch,"That is correct, even some Republican areas just because Trump was so repulsive."
dwsef2o,RE5TE,The parts of Illinois that grow soy and raise pigs voted for Trump. Fuck em.
dwsgwnh,strolpol,"You realize when one part of a state economically suffers, it hurts the whole thing, right? There's going to be downstream hits to everyone, no matter who they voted for."
dwso4g8,DontSleep1131,"Time for Cook County to secede! /s <-well kinda, fuck downstate."
dwsfd4b,,[deleted]
dwsfiao,RE5TE,I hope they don't want any big government interference
dwshus6,tomdarch,"I know that was sarcastic, but of course in reality: exactly the opposite. The ""red area"" scam is to maximize the government pork spending and welfare, all of which is paid for by the productive ""blue"" parts of the nation."
dwshqkb,tomdarch,"Yes, but overall IL is Chicago, plus some farm areas we support. (Of course, the ""red"" farm areas look at Chicago, see poor people (aka more melanin) and tell themselves that they are somehow propping up one of the city that is the economic engine for the midwest and one of the 10 most important financial centers globally.)In other words, some beans and pigs aren't really a big deal for the state as a whole."
dwsiob3,strolpol,"Soy is over 5 billion dollars of Illinois' economy, about a third of all agricultural production. It's a big deal. Pork is 1.8 billion. Now consider how much that is in tax value, and how strapped Illinois is already economically.Use your brain, dingus."
dwsobip,DontSleep1131,"Well hopefully this will jump start the Marijuana legalization bill. I wanna see one on the Governor's desk by Early March Next year.Disclaimer: Wont solve our financial mess, but hey at least i dont need to drown my sorrows in JUST booze when eventual collapse comes to pass"
dwsdei8,camelCaseCoffeeTable,"They're hitting wine hard. And I believe another major Californian product. It isn't just Trump supported places, although I believe this is more of a message from China saying we know exactly what products to hit to hurt your base, it's a smart move, since Trump can be voted out and Xi cannot be (won't be) anymore."
dwsdqi4,Lethena_LoL,"They're hitting the Californian farmers, who vote right wing. That's what's so interesting to me, yes, it'll hit CA as a state, but it's going to negatively affect the house members from farming districts in California. Not the cities proper. There's some collateral damage, but this is pretty precise as far as 50billion in tariffs can be."
dwse98u,kmmontandon,"> it's going to negatively affect the house members from farming districts in California.You're assuming they won't find a way to blame Obama, Hillary, Pelosi, and Jerry Brown. More likely, they just *won't mention it at all*, and since red district Californian reps almost never meet their constituents, and Sinclair is the primary NorCal local news broadcaster, they won't have to."
dwseiq6,Lethena_LoL,"I mean, sure, but discontent breeds desire for change. Look at the way discontent brought out support for Obama. You don't have to get them to talk about it, you just have to upset their base enough that they want change. You do that then the house members have to start worrying about their seat, especially if their competition can say ""x supported trumps trade war that has bankrupted your neighbors"" in their next campaign."
dwsfl70,FireUpontheDS9,Wouldn't tariffs by definition target goods either grown or manufactured? Generally rural and blue collar America does tend to lean right correct? Are they really targeting right wing voters or would Tariffs in general almost always target those voters?
dwshbaz,camelCaseCoffeeTable,"That's an interesting point. I wonder which reps represent that district and if they're closer to Jeff Flake Republicans, or if they're on Trump's side. If they're closer to Flake Republicans it would show the Chinese are trying to be surgical, but aren't fully understanding US policiesOn the other hand, hurting Trump's allies with an already punishing midterm on the way would be a hell of a way to win this trade war."
dwse5il,snssns,you guys are seriously giving china way too much credit.
dwsfpli,Divueqzed,Ah yes a nation with a mind blowingly large trade goods economy wouldn't be bothered to do only the most basic Wikipedia level homework ahead of their tariff plans. Yes that is surely the case.
dwse8p5,Lethena_LoL,"I really don't believe so. Chinese leadership actually listens to its experts, and while there's a lot wrong with China, their stranglehold leadership can be very fast and effective. It's the major reason their bubbles haven't wrecked their economy as seen by the US."
dwsegbj,snssns,they originally hit back with 3B in tariffs assumingely not realizing the optics of hitting back with such a smaller amount. That makes me think they aren't as competent as you guys are saying they are. thats all im really going off of though.
dwselrl,ScarsUnseen,"Or that was a warning shot. Sort of a ""are you sure you really want to do this?"""
dwsf7yv,Azurenightsky,"They tax our (some of) imports at 10 times the rate. This? This means nothing. You people really have no notion of what life is truly like, you sound overly eager to surrender to your enemy, thinking they'll be lovely and kind to you. How naive."
dwsemvs,Lethena_LoL,"Wasn't that just a short term show of force reply while they put together an actual one, which is this?"
dwseqmd,BestUdyrBR,Wasn't that in response to the initial steel tariffs and not to the tariffs trying to protect intellectual copyright?
dwsfjpo,DivisionXV,Are you kidding? China treats their citizens as an expendable resource. You barely have any form of freedom in china.
dwsfuvh,Lethena_LoL,"When did I say they cared about their populace? They don't. They're not a good govt, but lately they have been an effective govt. Those don't mean the same thing even slightly."
dwsga7c,DivisionXV,It does...
dwsgvyv,Lethena_LoL,"No, a good govt cares for its populace. An effective govt is good at getting what it wants, done.Those aren't the same thing. Hell, in many ways the us system is intentionally designed to be slow an ineffective, to stop corruption and protect its populace. It doesn't always work, but it is designed that way."
dwsxuw7,DivisionXV,"China flooded the market with cheap rare earth metals until mines in the US were forced to close. When that happened, they cranked the prices back up, knowing that a mining operation like that will take 10 plus years to get through American bureaucracy."
dwt9w2s,Lethena_LoL,You're just supporting my point...
dwtmppu,DivisionXV,They intentional hurt the US when they didn't have too. Trump is striking back at them. America will come on top of this
dwtvhlg,Lethena_LoL,"If the us could react at even a fourth the speed of China I'd maybe agree. But I don't believe that, especially under trump leadership."
dwu1q3u,DivisionXV,You underestimate us.
dwu36da,Lethena_LoL,"Under different leadership, sure, I can see in kind reactions.The US's current leadership is anti science and anti education. the US president reacts more on feelings than facts. There will be no real reply."
dwvgfhv,DivisionXV,I don't see how that is true at all. Giving the states control of their education plan is the best thing they can do.
dwsf5q0,Azurenightsky,> their stranglehold leadership can be very fast and effective. . .Someone give this idiot a history book for the love of all the lives at risk with this mode of thinking.
dwsfb6z,Lethena_LoL,"I'm not saying it will last forever or even that it's good, but right now in this moment, it is effective. And has been for about a decade. I'm not judging China on their past, I'm judging them on their current."
dwsgzx5,Azurenightsky,"> I'm judging them on their currentSo you're OK with the second coming of Communist China after the last attempt cost them roughly 100,000,000 Chinese citizens? Cool. Glad to know that's out in the open."
dwsh3dy,Lethena_LoL,"I even said I don't think it's a good thing, but they are effective right now . Are you honestly so blinded by their mindset towards their people you can't see even see their actions?"
dwsfbmg,gelinrefira,"You are not taking them seriously enough. European are doing the same thing, specifically targeting certain commodities to hurt trump voters. They are not as stupid as the current president. In fact, this is econ and statemanship 101. Any semi competent politician knows it."
dwsgegn,psionix,"Import or export, wine gets drunk.Ain't no problem there except for fires"

dwsekyq,ehpic207,"Are you American? If so that's dumb. You can not like Trump. By all means, hate the dude. But to choose for your/our country to lose is... Well that's kinda silly, don't you think?"
dwsewb9,TheKillerToast,I'd rather China than Russia.
dwsfj7m,if33lu,"I commented with tears running down my face. Like the meme of the jacky chan line drawing of him crying, if someone can link that."

dwsnkan,EatBabyBoomers,"Taiwan, obviously"
dwtmqus,Beepbopbopbeepbop,So are the older folks. I think they have been rooting for 50+ yrs. It's like rooting for the Browns or the Toronto Leafs.
dwsd8b9,Chii,"They are attacking trade goods that don't affect too many chinese citizens, but could hurt many manufacturers of such goods in the US, weakening the economy. And as we all know, a strong economy is the basis of a good country (and the capability to support a strong millitary).I don't think this is good for the US of A, and if they do not smartly adjust, my suspicion is this is going to be the beginning of the end..."
dwsdlvf,RickAndMortyLuvr,">my suspicion is this is going to be the beginning of the end...Oh, well if some 14 year old on reddit with absolutely no economic background says so...I guess that's it then."

dwsduav,Less_GOT,I am not very sympathetic. They did vote for this.
dwsduxp,Rubberbabybuggybum,If you aren't a millionaire and vote for Trump you're voting against your interests. Period.
dwtybti,orinthedentist,Like the alternative was better. What would Hillary have done for the poor?? NEWSFLASH: They are both corporatists.
dwsdl95,antonius22,"It is the same thing that happened during the 2002 tariffs, but the EU was the ones doing what China is doing now."
dwsekf6,ActiveFrontEnd,"The whiskey one caught my eye. Looked it up and it will impact Mitch McConnell's Kentucky. I don't think they are just going after Trump supporters, I thin they are trying to turn the GOP against him."
dwsdk5z,droans,"Also swing states, too."
dwsdwp5,texlorax,"Who says that? One example doesn't make it so. And agriculture is a huge part of our exports, so I'm not sure you can say that just because they are targeting those products mean they are specifically targeting the states that produce most of them.On the other hand, it may or may not be a smart political move if this was intended. We'll see."
dwsezki,gelinrefira,It's the same thing with what Europe is doing.
dwsff61,kapnklutch,Nah Illinois is a big soy state and we're getting fucked too. I mean our economy is relatively diverse so we're getting fucked in some areas but not the rest. So I guess we're better off than other states.
dwsfixm,Lethena_LoL,"People have mentioned this, so I cross referenced maps of districts that farm heavily vs political map of the districts that voted for trump. There is some cross over, but very little."
dwsfi20,AbominableFro44,"I think it's more that most US producers/exporters typically lean Republican, and that's the most natural place to apply tariffs."
dwsfmna,Lethena_LoL,"Except almost all tech is completely left out. Reading the tariffs, they left out almost everything large cities produce, and large cities generally lean dem."
dwsg60a,AbominableFro44,That could also be because tech is an area that'd suffer the most in China if they were to impose tariffs on that economic sector.
dwsfoz5,herthawool,"Seems to be the common consensus when it comes to stopping him. When the E.U was threatened with steel tariffs, they came straight back threatening to hit products from trump states too. (and/or swing states)"
dwsftzy,ferfecksakes,"> This isn't anti US, this is anti trump support.Because Trump is the one in control. Why would Trump change anything if it was impacting Democratic states?"
dwsfy7a,chubbs123123123,Lol please.
dwsg67x,onioning,"Lots of these hurt California. I was hoping they'd do that, because I think it the thing most likely to more quickly put an end to this nonsense, but they didn't really. Plenty of harm done to California by these moves."
dwsizaa,anonmilitary,I'm sure a lot of midwest farmers are fine taking a hit to hurt California.
dwslkd2,onioning,"I really hope that's not true. I hope we're not to the stage that our political tribalism has got us taking pleasure over the misfortune of, well, of us. Our we happy to make ourselves suffer?Course, part of the irony is that CA pays for a fair bit of that Midwest corn and soy production."
dwsndzu,anonmilitary,Has nothing to do with tribalism. CA as a political body actively tries to push legislation that would either make me a criminal or weaponize the government against me in some way that is unacceptable. I'm not going to pretend we're not enemies. We are.
dwsoumm,onioning,What the dickens are you talking about?
dwsgqdk,jackksouth,"I hadn't even noticed until you pointed that out. Very interesting, wouldn't this affect the country as a whole in the long run though?"
dwsgytc,Lethena_LoL,"It absolutely will effect the country long term, but places that are heavy red will be hit first and hardest, which may have the effect of stripping trump of his support in congress, and that may be the point."
dwsh70q,jackksouth,https://i.imgur.com/Zv4Go4v.mp4
dwshb6a,Lethena_LoL,"THIS ISN'T PREQUEL MEMES, GO BACK TO YOUR CAGE!"
dwsgxrc,W0666007,I find it really interesting that our shitty electoral college system makes it easy for foreign nations to make politically directed tariffs at the US.
dwsh4x9,Lethena_LoL,"Didn't say it was a good thing, just a thing."
dwsgylm,Valfourin,"Thats just a convenient coincidence. It's harder to put a tarrif on sending emails and making vlogs. So it's harder to put a tarrif on big cities with less exports, compared to puting tarrifs on cities/states who export raw materials. Like just think of all the things you would have to tarrif to negatively impact solely NYC for example."
dwsiigt,thrifty_rascal,I think you're stretching it a little there.
dwsijcn,rob6021,"Sadly this is what will enrage trump and make him do more, he doesn't want to sacrifice 'his' people only the ones that are against him."
dwskxoq,thetimechaser,This gives me hope
dwsl2ia,NorthWestKid,Well over half of us are against this stupid shit and in the wake of everyone finding out the GOP has been evil all along China is using this to improve their global image and take over vacated U.S. leadership which will continue to hurt us long after Donnie dumbass and Co. are gone.So. Much. Winning.
dwsl7bh,Obliviousobi,This isn't the first time this has happened either. Bush imposed tariffs on steel during his Presidency and the EU threatened to counter the tariffs with a tariff on oranges (Florida) and cars (Michigan). The tariffs were withdrawn after this.
dwspng8,Drop_,"That's not really true.They've also targeted California, for example, in their tariff status on wine from the US."
dwssvib,silverrabbit,"Oddly enough Illinois is the largest soy producer in the country, so it actually is hurting a Clinton state the most."
dwsvrvj,HebrewHamm3r,Good.I just hope the rest of us don't get hurt too badly.
dwsw147,BleuBrink,Isn't wine and aircraft tariffs hurting west coast?
dwswsgd,Revydown,What does the US have to target to get the Chinese to hate Xi?
dwszncn,Nayberryk,"Because, believe it or not, Chinese in general actually like the US. They like the technological progress that has been made in your country, the efficiency at the lower levels of your government, and also that the US helped China in their fight with the Japanese.They just don't like aggressive baffoons attacking their country, whehter with military aircraft or economic sanctions"
dwt2x75,Grampionjr,People getting hit the hardest are Trump supporters. Trump supporters probably still support Trump. So.. ok.
dwth0oy,RustyDuckies,I feel like that will only feed into the persecution complex Trump supporters have. They'll just stay “Deep State” and tell other Trump supporters to hold strong.
dwthddn,Lethena_LoL,"I mean, they've worked so hard to fuck over everyone not their demographic, that it seems only obvious they would be retaliated against. it's not deep state, it's kicking a hornets nest then crying conspiracy when you get stung."
dwsd739,Handburn,They alter targeting California exports also such as wine.
dwsdwcj,Lethena_LoL,"But most California wine is grown in red areas of the state, as far as I know. That means house Republicans seeing their home districts hurt while Democrats are relatively unscathed. They're not just targeting red states, they're targeting red districts."
dwse70x,Burnwulf,"Indeed, agriculture here leans red, the idiots are short on labor since voting for Trump, tons of produce wasted because they scared away the Mexicans and whites didn't want to do it. They'll find something to blame."
dwsegdu,Handburn,"Sonoma and Napa tend to vote blue. Many of the other agriculture counties vote red, but the heavier wine producing regions are much more liberal with the exception of the Lodi area."
dwsf2vz,UNMANAGEABLE,"It's weird to admit this, but I'm actually really impressed with China for having this stance to affect his supporters directly. But I'm afraid that people who were “smart enough” to vote for trump are going to scream and cry for uncle Donny to hit back harder instead of realizing and admitting to tactical mistakes. Telling an alt-Right-er to de-escalate won't compute.Our poor 401k's today. :-("
dwsfe6e,Lethena_LoL,"Always keep some of the 401 in a money market to invest when things explode =PThough that's less effective when the dollar itself is dropping, but that's another story."
dwsfm6c,UNMANAGEABLE,I literally had told my SO I was going to switch to an conservative portfolio a month ago and never did. It's too late now :-(.
dwsi9qd,blaze_dis_one,"Still not far off the high, you can act now to reduce the size of some of your positions to cash."
dwsg8z5,Lethena_LoL,"Ugh, that's rough. It's hard to sell when times are good, because we're scared of losing out. But selling only when times are bad means you only get the loss and never the recovery. I hope it works out for you!"
dwsf3vg,upnflames,"That's been the response to every US initiated trade war, whether it's lead by democrats or republicans. No one wants a trade war - it's terrible for all players. China wants things to go back to the way they were because they're not idiots, so they pick off industries specifically in Trumps base so that he doesn't get reelected. The thinking being to get the adults back to the table. I'm definitely not a liberal in a lot of monetary ways, but watching Trump get elected was like watching a small child throw a tantrum and punch the floor. It's fucking annoying for everyone, but it hurts the kid more then anyone else. Right now, it seems like red states are taking the full brunt of the Trump presidency. The people who voted him in are going to be poorer at the end of four years and I think they're probably just starting to feel that now. Opinion should get interesting in the next few months."
dwt0qpj,salute29,Your right about the small child throwing a tantrum it was hillary she didn't even bother to in person thank her supporters she sent out a stooge to do it while she sat in her room throwing her tantrum
dwt3096,upnflames,"Haha, yes, you're right! Over a year into this shit show of an administration that's fucking flying full tilt off the rails, but fuck Hillary right! Hurr durr, but her emails! Talk about beating a dead fucking horse. SAD!"
dwt343h,salute29,Looks like the demobots are here
dwtagkc,upnflames,"Lol, can't make a strong argument as to why a trade war is a good thing, better look at the buzzword list and stick to the script. Bickering about an election that happened a year ago is not helpful. This is not a democrat thing or a republican thing. This is about whether or not your Walmart tab is going to go up 25% in the next two years. How many small US manufacturers are going to shut down because they don't have the capital to make the jump from Chinese sourced material to US sourced materials. Or the companies that are going to lay people off because their international markets are going to be halved. What about those who find themselves suddenly over leveraged when revenue initially drops? Will they have the floating capital to deal with decreased sales while consumers get used to higher prices? Probably not. Yes, incomes may go up from this and there could be some good job growth in industries that haven't been targeted by China and the EU. Both would happen in five years, maybe. But inflation and the first round of lay offs would happen a lot sooner. Remember, they don't call it a trade war for nothing. In a conventional war, the only ones really at risk are American soldiers in some far off land. In a trade war, your enemy can very easily destroy the economy of your small town if they choose. Unlike a conventional war, cities are not in the cross hairs this time. China is going to want to put the hurt on the heartland where their perceived enemy is. And even if the US ""wins"", there's going to be casualties and the fact is, it's less likely to be democratic states."
dwsdq5e,AvalancheZ250,The Chinese don't hate Americans. They just hate the government's isolationist and protectionist mantra so like the stereotypical good guys they punish the government while trying to minimise damage to the innocents.Since when did the world turn upside down?
dwsf9xm,AmericanSamoa6666,The EU did the same thing. These tariffs are often aimed to do more political dammage than economic dammage.
dwsg5pz,RuiNatiion,That is fucking retarded. They are targeting our biggest exports.
dwsgrao,Lethena_LoL,"You mean like big pharmaceutical? Which is entirely absent from the list. Or maybe the finance and tech industries, which are also entirely absent. Perhaps you mean medical tech, oh wait, none of that is even slightly mentioned. Yet all of those are in top 10 us largest exports. You would think they would have SOME mention of this was blanket tariffs. It's weird those are all also heavily produced in cities, which lean blue."
dwshycr,Nickk_Jones,If it were only Trump supporters there I'd say they deserve it.
dwsi5np,Lethena_LoL,I don't think anyone deserves their livelihoods stolen because of a political trade war... But you do reap what you sow.
dwsse72,blindedbyhindsight,"That's because the world is not anti-American , we're anti trump, (and pretty much anti republican for that matter)"
dwsdq14,aletoledo,Maybe it's just because the red states are the ones that produce exports?
dwse5ak,Lethena_LoL,"Not even slightly the case, lol. That's an absurd statement."
dwsehut,WatchItBuster,Really think you're giving them wayyyyy to much credit here.
dwsel1h,Lethena_LoL,"That a govt is acting on information that is given by experts on the best way to get what they want? Why would that be giving them too much credit? Especially a country that's shown its manipulative side, like China. Their currency manipulation didn't happen by accident."
dwseny5,WatchItBuster,"I mean thinking that China is explicity targeting ""areas that Trump won"" is definitely reaching in terms of why they are choosing to change their tarrifs."
dwsf8su,Lethena_LoL,"Have you read and cross referenced the tariff list? It's pretty blatant. Distinct lack of tech companies that dominate a lot of blue states, and other things produced in large cities(which mostly lean blue). It's not like the us doesn't export those things, they're just conveniently left off the list while farmed products (cotton, tobacco, soy, beef) are all there. Farming areas usually go red. Specifically targeting combustion piston based car production, while ignoring others(Tesla seems to be selected around, as far as I could tell) I haven't done a full cross reference, but at first glance, it seems pretty fucking specific to red areas of the country."
dwscy5g,awe300,They've targeted red states and even red districts in blue states. Scalpel is exactly right.
dwsdy2a,snssns,I feel like china's government is not that calculated or sharp to target specific regions assoc w trump. when trump first announced tariffs on them they hit back with 3B in tariffs not realizing how laughable that amount was compared to what trump imposed. the fact that that happened sort of makes me feel like you guys are giving them too much credit.
dwseirg,itsZizix,"The 3 billion was in retaliation for steel/aluminum tariffs, they were already preparing this list for when Trump announced the IP related sanctions."

dwsamxx,ZeJerman,"This still means that the Chinese consumer gets fucked on Soy products because the EU product is more expensive to the US product pre tariff.I dont know what the current market for Soy products are in the EU but I would be amazed if there wasnt already a tariff in place to prevent the dumping of US soy beans on to the US market, hurting EU growers."
dwsf3qm,HippopotamicLandMass,"China is ramping up imports of Soy from south america, particularly Brazil.

dwsavrj,Steadypirate,"While it cost the Chinese consumer more. They are importing this good. Which means they just have to find new buyers, and they can negotiate the price down to limit the rise in cost. (So its possible to just eat profit loss and not pass it onto the consumer) The US in the other hands will have a shit load of soy beans they can't sell which could lead to bankruptcy and job losses on smaller farmers.I think the EU has anti dumping laws too but I'm sure.But to answer you question yes every one loses just the US loses more than China doesEdit: im just hobbiest sorry in advance if im off the mark."
dwsbos4,ZeJerman,"In the soy situation, other exporting countries could be winners, as the barrier of entry has been lowered due to the increased price of sale. Worked in Trade and Logistics in Aus and currently working in Germany, I havent seen a situation where businesses dont pass on the cost of a tariff, as it lifts the cost of the entire market. It will also take time to ramp up the economy of scale as current EU producers (Read EU as non-US producers) already have orders that need to be filled with their existing customers. This ultimately shifts the worldwide soybean market but, again it is often difficult to shift customers from one producer to another, as there is some amount of ris in doing so.Just because the US Soybean is cheaper, doesnt mean that they will be bought by importers immediately, there is often different Quarantine requirements on products from the US, as they have different plant based diseases to other regions, and if they dont have an established market in the country they want to sell to that barrier to entry may be prohibitevly high.It will be intersting to see what happens here.Almost everyone is a net loser, although some non US or China parties may win a little as they fill in the gap left by the tariffs."
dwsdck1,Steadypirate,Would I be correct in thinking if China shift to new supply chains and then us ends traffirs.China might no move supply chains back due to costs? So I short term traffis can cause long term damage?
dwsdoi1,ZeJerman,"Correct. It takes effort, investment and risk to change suppliers, especially overseas suppliers.If the tariffs are removed and the supply chains have been solidified with non-US suppliers, US suppliers would need to make it economically worth while to Chinese importers to change over back to them. This is also difficult because the US suppliers would have lost a significant section of thier economy of scale and the non-EU supplier gained the advantage of a larger economy of scale.Not to mention the other factors, such as less ship space US to China, because as the demand of US products drops so does the demand for ship space, making previously economicaly sound shipping lanes no longer economicaly viable.This isnt just onesided though, the same exact points can be made for China also, just that China has much more influence on the rest of the world markets than the US.This trade war can cause serious long term issues for both the US and China."
dwse0zh,Steadypirate,Interesting though I feel with China's links to Africa and basically offering the EU a good deal. They could offset the economic damage for a solid soft power gain. (Would only take soild market links and an anti Russia stance and China's EUs new best friend)The USA though I can see out right losses in everything :/ I don't see what they stand to gain if China does not shift
dwsefyg,barsoap,"The EU is a massive, massive net importer of soy, mostly from South America. Truth be told we have a significant protein crops shortfall: Without imports, our meat industry would instantly collapse. Doesn't really help that Canada has cornered the lentil market."
dwsekwv,Steadypirate,I think that's due to EU farming policy though. We have a huge amount of poorly used landed due to these rules.Which was part of why UK farmers wanted out. However i have just highlighted that the EU wont be able to react fast enough to take advantage of this market change due to the snail pace it moves at
dwsfl50,barsoap,"Eh, the CAP is designed to ensure food safety, and we *do* have more than enough protein... if we didn't turn it all into meat, which is a very lossy process. If you're a prepper, prep your lentil stew recipes :)Not to mention that most of the EU just doesn't have proper climate for soy, we couldn't cover that shortfall even if we wanted to. There's one possible solution that would still allow us meat without protein imports: A two or three years moratorium on fishing, such that stocks can replenish to levels that allow them to grow while we still fish the current quotas. Send the fishers to study marine biology in the mean time, that won't hurt (and they probably won't protest, either). It took literal centuries of over-fishing to get stocks to the current near-extinct levels, with a bit of management we could fish much more and still be completely sustainable."
dwsfr0l,Steadypirate,Good luck getting that happen the UK has been trying since it joined the block.We had to dump concrete around gibraltar to get the Spanish to stop finishing their
dwsj6wg,barsoap,"The UK did nothing to make the EU fishing policy saner, all it did was side-line domestic fishers by completely defunding anything connected to fishing harbours. Which comes as no surprise, after all, London isn't a fishing harbour. The EU was the only state institution investing in those areas.And Gibraltar's waters, believe it or not, are EU waters. Spanish fishers have just as much right to fish there as British fishers have to fish in Spanish waters. That there's no British fishers any more, now, well... see bloody above."

The US meanwhile has to find new suppliers for all the stuff they import from China.......which is harder I imagine. That said what will happen in practice is that the costs will simply be passed onto the consumer........which in theory will hit the US consumer harder as they import cheaper goods of everyday use from China while US exports tend to be more technologically advanced (higher up the value chain) and wont directly feature in the consumption basket of the Chinese consumer."

Also taxing it would be nice."
dwsbdv6,AussieWalk,I have heard that some companies are trying to do that but it difficult and China has an internal problem with counterfeits.Chinese consumers want a guarantee that the product is from Australia and often require a receipt as part of the deal.for those that don't know this is why it is Baby powder in particular https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Chinese_milk_scandalAlso most of them are not actually travelling back to China with them it more like personal shoppershttps://theconversation.com/chinese-personal-shoppers-have-created-a-new-type-of-retail-store-in-australia-86844

China is targeting specific products because they can't inflict as much economic damage as the US can in an all out trade war (which is fucking dumb, btw...I'm no way in favor of this). If that were the case, they'd reply with the same level of sweeping tariffs that the US did. But they can't because the US is still a huge market and cutting it off completely would crush them.This action by China is intended to get the adults back to the table and end this stupid thing before it spirals out of control. If anything, democrats should be letting this thing play out for a bit. This is how the GOP will lose the house, the senate, and the White House. Not porn stars or immigration.

Trying to reduce the trade deficit by increasing tariffs and inducing more manufacturing jobs is counter to that ideal, but the average undereducated Trump voter wouldn't know any better."
dwsf1pr,ascendingone,That's not an ideal. That's just how things have turned out. It's not something to strive for. Manufacturing is a integral part of any economy and right now the US is severely lacking.
dwsl9nd,jsfly,>Manufacturing is a integral part of any economy and right now the US is severely lacking.Heavy industry certainly is. Manufacturing in general is not because you can outsource it to great economic benefit. >That's not an ideal. That's just how things have turned out. And why do suppose things turned out the way they did then? Magic? No the ideals of capitalism happened.
dwspdjb,ascendingone,It's not the ideal of capitalism. It's a side effect of an unfair global labor market. China's and other countries' labor practices are unfair compared to the US and it makes sense to punish them for that. They will eventually lose because their population is declining almost beyond repair and they won't be able to rely on their own people to drive their consumer goods based economy.
dwsu51b,jsfly,"This type of victimhood mentality that some folks have is exactly what Trump preys upon. Fact is, there's nothing unfair about it. Doesn't matter if it was Taiwan in the 90s, China now or India in the future. Developing countries will always have lower labor costs than developed countries and for profit companies will always seek to take advantage of that because capitalism's ideal is the pursuit of profit."

dwsgtl0,Cranyx,I can't even tell if you're joking.
dwsbxz9,Risay117,"Honestly the sad thing is this type of economy is what allows the US to dominate the trade and control the flows of it making it an economic powerhouse. It also allows the use of the US dollars as the biggest reserve currency cause everyone can do trade with it as it actually is used by everyone.A blue collar based economy actually weakens the US dollar as the only reason to hold US dollars is to buy from US, but then you only need however much you need, but with a white collar based economy US dollars is the only currency you can accept and therefore allowing people to use it as trade with other nations, you will always end up with excess of US dollars and if you cant use it in your nation you will have to invest it in the US economy again, to make it useful. Currency is only usefull if it can get something done, if it is hoarded it is useless."
dwsc36w,MakanMari,I never said blue collar based economy. I meant having an economy that takes care of the manufacturing sector because that is what built countries up in the first place
dwscgn8,Risay117,The thing is the US still has the manufacturing industry but it is a very advanced and heavily automated but a huge portion of US economy is in manufacturing and alot of people work in it. The problem is the traditional blue collar jobs dont exist or are threatened as the economy and manufacturing practices are changing.I mean car manufacturers are automating and firing huge number of workers and yes sending jobs overseas but the amount being produced is going up. It just is efficiency mostly killing the jobs.
dwsgd7b,ascendingone,"If that was the case then why does everything we buy have Made in China stamped on it. Clearly at least, the US could be doing better in the manufacturing sector than it is already."
dwscvtw,MakanMari,"Oh is that so? ""In total, 2.92 million jobs have been added to the U.S. economy since President Trump was elected – including 263,000 manufacturing jobs since President Trump took office.""Remember the manufuring sector was actually losing jobs before that. The data isnt looking good for the free trade advocates"
dwsikpk,Risay117,"Actually the jobs created under Trump are actually due to the end of recession which concided with the last year of Obama presidency, if we are going to play the jobs game, one can say there has been more job growth under Obama and economic growth under Obama than Trump. The manufacturing side grew after the recession which began under the GOP Bush era, the very recession Obama inherited, and left Trump with a booming economy.Now the recession blame can be placed everywhere, but Trump has received a gift from Obama that is a great economy that is roaring to new heights, if Trump ends up creating a recession from this, that would be an achievement I would not expect anyone would want. Because honestly to fuck up the economy that Obama left is really hard, and Trump is so close to doing so, by making alot of scary moves and scaring the market.Also you may hate this link as it's from last year but manufacturing jobs have been coming back since the 2008 financial crisis. But they have nothing close to what the US had during the 70s and 80s. The only reason for their drop was due to the recession.http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/07/news/economy/us-manufacturing-jobs/index.htmlAlso most are tied to the oil and gas sector, as that sector is growing in the US at the moment with new drills etc.But there are other reasons, although the US manufacturing deficit is growing with other nation's in trade the increased demand world wide means the US also benefits from it creating more demand and thereby more jobs. Also the US GOP does not care about the deficit anymore so both government and opposition are okay with it.We don't know what the trade side will do until these tariffs have had their say as this is Trump's first decision on trade and it's to early to say whether it is good or not. The TPP never existed when Trump was president so leaving did not have an effect on the US existing economy and Trump has not left the NAFTA agreement yet.So right now say free trade idealist are wrong is not the correct response.https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-09/manufacturing-keeps-adding-jobs-amid-trump-s-tough-talk"
dwsc61b,jsfly,">There you go, favouring white collar over blue collar workers.That's a preference for people in general with respect to low level blue collar work. No one wants to be used as a robot, doing the same repetitive task all day whether it's picking fruit or the assembly line. That's why most manufacturing is outsourced and Mexican migrant farm workers exist coast to coast.>Now you know why Trump won.Trump won because people were sick of the political establishment, not because they wanted more assembly line work."

If China puts tariffs on US chemicals, then Chinese chemical producers win but everyone who uses them loses.But the same applies to China. Trade wars make economies less efficient and hurt both sides, you are just hoping that the other side will give up some political concessions first. But you need to plan it out carefully and keep negotiating to make that happen."
dws9z5g,MakanMari,"Yea so both side loses. He was making it sound as if only the US loses. Well then its just down to who can outlast this, and i believe China will cave. They need to sell to the US more than the US needs to sell to them."

dwsfr8k,epicwinguy101,"China has a much greater dependence on exports than the US though. That's kind of the issue in the first place, in a way."
dwskov8,,what about the US dependence on their imports? why is it bad for the US to buy more from China than they sell to them?
dwsnkzq,epicwinguy101,"I'd say it mostly boils down to alternatives, as far as dependence goes. China exports a lot of rare earths, which we would need some time to develop alternatives for, but as for cheap goods, there are many nations that would love to fill the gap for. There are a lot of poorer nations to buy from, but no country that has the massive consumer market the US has. As for why it's bad, I don't think a trade imbalance is inherently bad in and of itself if it forms purely from market forces. Free trade is win-win on average for both parties. The issue is that this particular imbalance in part exists because of unfair practices trade rather than a natural market equilibrium under free trade conditions. We are far more open to Chinese companies in the US than they have been to ours entering their own markets, and these abusive, one-sided practices have cost us a lot."
dwsb79v,,">They need to sell to the US more than the US needs to sell to them.show your work. I have a trade imbalance with my grocery store, but I need them more than they need me.These are temporary tariffs. The outcome will be the same as the tariffs under Bush* and Obama--both economies will be hurt for a time and then business will go back to normal. There hasn't been a ""trade war"" since the Great Depression.I don't understand how the GOP can go from criticizing Obama for subsidizing renewable energy to cheering Trump for subsidizing steel production.*Bush implemented a temporary steel import tariff similar to Trump before cancelling it early. Obama put in place a temporary tariff on tires imported from China. [it didn't go well](https://piie.com/publications/policy-briefs/us-tire-tariffs-saving-few-jobs-high-cost)."

dwsa7kn,x0y1,"Maybe you should look in your history books a bit. Remember the Great Depression and what happens when you ignite a trade war.>The most prominent trade war of the 20th century was ignited by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff act of 1930, which imposed steep tariffs on roughly 20,000 imported goods. Led by Canada, America's trading partners retaliated with tariffs on United States exports, which plunged 61 percent from 1929 to 1933. The tariffs were repealed in 1934.......>Smoot-Hawley “was such a disaster that it's held sway over American trade policy for over 80 years,” said Joshua Meltzer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who also teaches international trade law at Johns Hopkins University. “No one wants to repeat it.”..............>He cited what have become known as the “chicken wars” of the early 1960s, a trade dispute set off when Germany and France imposed tariffs on American chicken. The United States retaliated by imposing tariffs on an array of goods, including French brandy, light trucks and Volkswagen buses. The United States even threatened to reduce its troop presence in Europe. Despite those pressures, the newly formed European Economic Community did not back down, and in that sense the United States “lost” the war.>The biggest losers, though, were American and European consumers deprived of choices in the marketplace and forced to pay higher prices for what was available.>There were also unintended consequences. American automakers, insulated from foreign competition by the tariffs, failed to modernize, improve quality or reduce costs, setting the stage for a decades-long decline, which for Chrysler and General Motors ended in bankruptcy........................https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/business/tariff-trump-trade-wars.htmlWe live in interesting times and considering that Trump said he will increase the tariffs again we just start a nice circle of stupidity and I really hope he pisses eh EU off too because we will not let us blackmailed by him and then there is anohter trade war front opens because we have said it before it will here tit for tat too........"

dwsc8rq,jackpaintsthestreets,"Well... Yes, fuck Donald Trump. But you are right that this isn't a trade war. That said there are dozens of other ways to address this. The TPP for one was a great one. The WTO is another, although it can be a weird and long process. This action is a throw care to the wind, repercussions be damned and make everything suck just like .5% more for everybody.This isn't a trade war yet, but it is an arms build up getting ready for a trade war. It's uncomfortably on the path there, and it's not a path that a reasonable person should want to take.To Trumps credit, that's part of his strategy. He basically wants to play a game of nuclear chicken and see how close to the edge he can get without toppling over. His unpredictability, and irrationality even, are strengths in this."

Reddit isn't just the hard left like /r/politics would have you believe. I've been so alienated from Trump *after voting for him* that I have no place to express my serious disgust with his administration but with people who fundamentally disagree with half of what I stand for.So before you laugh at what Reddit has turned into, consider what Trump has forced his one-time supporters to do.

dwsq9af,CamTasty,"I'm trying to understand, but I only learned recently about general stock investment. Could you help a laymen learn what you mean? Like high supply, lower demand will cause selling of stocks then people react to how the DOW is affected then sell, too?"
dwsrkmm,CardioSurgeonWannabe,"IANAE: I would say the foundation of macroeconomics is the supply demand curve. What that means at its core is that something in high supply, but low demand, will drive prices down. Conversely, something that is in low supply, and high demand will drive prices up. As people sell, this increases the overall supply, because of this, the price begins to drop. As prices begin to drop people begin panicking and start dumping investments to accrue as little of a loss as possible, and the cycle repeats.What you should do, IMO: is hold. The stock market will comeback eventually, and will continue to grow. In the last 10 years the DOW has grown by 20k points since the low point of the recession."

So kind of with what you're saying, there's worse things, but citizens control the economics and some are very reactionary"

dwsphy3,wellwasherelf,"That's an absolutely massive age range. Of course people in their early twenties, who are literally still in college or have only recently graduated, don't have retirement savings. People usually don't start thinking about saving for retirement until they are in their 30's. Even if 2/3 is an accurate figure (I highly doubt it is), that data would be skewed to the point of irrelevance when a large portion of your demographic has never even had their first real job yet.Also, what he said is true regardless. If you don't have finances, then it obviously doesn't apply to you. But if you do have finances (and statistically, most do), don't make rash decisions, or you'll soon find yourself in the group that ""doesn't have finances""."
dwsptsh,MasterLJ,"I posted the age range precisely so people could make their own judgement, as I agree, it is massive.All conventional retirement wisdom says to start as early as possible. It used to be normal to start with your first big-boy job in your early 20's or even late teens. Again, I find myself agreeing with you about people waiting until their 30's, but where I think there's a disconnect is because that's a change from the norm, it isn't/wasn't the status quo. There are plenty of other economic markers like home ownership, lives with parents, student debt, entrepreneurship levels, that show that something is markedly different about US economics than it was 30 years ago."

dwtct8f,rukh999,Clinton definitely.
dwtcnnr,mike54076,"Literally anyone. If you conciously decide not to vote, you are taking your own voice away. I don't really see how anyone could purposefully not vote then turn around and bitch about the results of the election. For all the whining and bitching us millennials do about what's going on, we don't fucking vote and it showed in this election. On a personal note, I honestly believe that any person could have voted for a literal piece of human feces and still made a better choice than voting for Trump."
dwtcr5q,PandaBytes2001,"See you say literally anyone but then you get mad at people voting for trump? How does that make any sense, you probably got mad at people for voting for Hillary too"
dwtoddx,mike54076,"I guess you don't understand how tiered reasoning works. Yeah, I'm upset at people who voted for cheetoface McGee, but I am even more upset at those who didn't vote. I can at least have a discussion over political differences with someone who voted for Mr fuckface, but I believe that it is even worse to throw your voice away, political apathy is something that is very real and very scary within the US. It drives voter turnout down and allows for idiots to get into office."
dwtokrz,PandaBytes2001,"Yea I get your point, so would you rather have Donald or Hillary, I'm just curious, and whichever oneYou pick why did you pick them!"
dwtxip1,mike54076,"Oh Hillary for sure. I don't know if I have the patience to sit here and type out the 1739474927 reasons, but near the top of the list has to be the blatent science denial and the general fucking that this administration is doing to our environment. Oh, and the blatent pandering to religious groups and the lack of enforcement on the Johnson amendment. Neither of which would have happened under Hillary. I'm not staying she was great (I voted for Bernie and was very proud that he carried MI (my state) in the primaries)."
dwtxn44,PandaBytes2001,"Yea I agree with you there, I think Bernie would've been great as well, but I'm only 16 so yea, sorry for bothering you I just like to hear other people's inputs on this kinda stuff"
dwtyueu,mike54076,"That's fine. Never be sorry for asking questions and don't take other people's shit for honestly seeking the answer to said questions. Be informed, do your research. Also, from my own experience when I was your age (god I'm getting old), don't just vote in line with your parents. I mean, if it makes sense and you agree that's cool, but remain skeptical and make up your own mind. When I first voted, I voted for Bush (first term) and I have regretted that vote for a looong time."
dwt7hgw,floppydo,"Everything you said is true except for the part where you imply that voting for Trump wasn't idiotic. Regardless of what anyone's concerns and issues are, Trump is a transparently moronic narcissist. Anyone who checks a box that means ""I want that man to be the leader of the US,"" is an idiot."
dwt8ms0,Automobilie,I voted third party. With a little digging on the third party candidates they're pretty down to earth people and a good chunk of the mwdia flak they got was overblown. O ly way to waste your vote is to vote for someone you don't like.

dwtbhgx,StoopidZoidberg,"Lost time, which is the most valuable commodity and cant be made back."
dwt0qtj,I_inform_myself,"Sounds like you dont have a very well vested portfolio.Part of mine took a little hit, but most of it rode smooth growth.Then again, I have more in bonds, and international funds, than just American companies, which are usually more susceptible to fluctuations."
dwt331t,,Can't make a lot with little risk. If you are young you likley have very little in bonds. It's normal as you get closer to retirement to move you positions to less aggressive holdings. But if you have 20 years to go I wouldn't hold any bonds and do a super aggressive allocation.
dwt4gva,I_inform_myself,"I have at least 50% in my 401K in bonds.Even with this, my current path is to have about 1.5 Million by 60, and that is with only 10% contribution and 6% employer match.My IRA (I put in like 100$ a month) has a projection of 500K by 60.I am 26, so it will fluctuate much more in my life. But bonds must be paid first, so that helps for volatility. Yes, lower interest yields, but less risk for me, means I don't have to worry when shit hits the fan.The other half is more volatile, but right now, any stock investments scare me, because of the sheer volatility of the stock market."
dwt569u,,That's a retarded portfolio allocation. I wouldn't have 50% in bonds if I was 5 years from retirement. I'm 32 and have about a million right now in the market and have no bonds. My return last year was 25%. I understand wanting to be a risk averse but you have a very old person risk averse allocation especially for someone who is 26. Your portfolio should be super high risk right now bc you have 30 years to ride out volatility. I'd get a new portfolio manager.
dwtpvq0,Hawkals,"Dang, what did you do since graduating? Not much younger than you, and have significantly less in total assets, not just in the market."
dwtrs70,,"Phd biochemistry. Made a lot in a pharma IPO. Used it to start my own company. Put a few hundred k in the market in more diversified positions to not loose everything upon the news of a failed clinical trial. Not a rich man but working on it. At 26 I was basically broke this other guy who is 26 is ahead of me by far at the same age. I could barley pay my bills when I moved here. My success was mostly luck and now I'm trying to shape it into a bigger fortune. Basically get in on early discovery at pharma startups, be less then employee hire #20 and you generally will do pretty well if the company doesn't die. I'm in the SF Bay Area."
dwx8kg9,Hawkals,"Ah, grats on the pharma IPO. I'm in the Bay Area too, but the startup isn't/hasn't IPOed (yet). We'll see. Best of luck growing your money, and good luck with your company!"
dwt6596,I_inform_myself,"I am the portfolio manager.My IRA is less bond heavy, and more stock and security heavy. My IRA had a 9% return last year. My 401k which is bond heavy had 20% return.So ya, you are right. You'll probably retire with more money, because you took those risks. But what happens, in 10 years, when the student loan bubble pops, and many people are defaulting on their student loans, and can no longer afford to buy things? The market will crash, stocks will be worth a fraction of what they are, you'll lose a huge portion of your returns, and I'll still be riding a smooth steady positive curve.Right now, I care about steady growth. I hardly think it is stupid that I want to have high risk. Right now the market can't even stay stable for a even a week. Stocks react to much to market volatility, and market corrections cause your big gains to go sharply down. Bonds don't respond to these changes, and allow my losses to be minimized.Like I said, my current outlook is to have 1.5 Mil by 65, and another 500K from my IRA (which I only put 100$ a month into).I also have mid term mutual funds, so I can get a house, without having to save up as much present money. I guess it also comes with the train of thought in the mind. I prefer to ensure a comfortable life when I retire, or decide to stop working, than have to worry myself when the market gets hurt, or makes major corrections or we go into recession.But back to the original point. No, it isn't retarded. You had 25% return without bonds, I had 20% with a lot of bonds. I have my portfolio hedged, so I don't get destroyed."
dwt9i21,,1.5mil won't be enough to retire on in 30 years. It will be worth 3x less bc of inflation. You need at least 5 mil. And yes there will be a crash of some sort in the future but the point is that you have enough time to recover. If there is a crash in 10 years you have another 20 to recover from it before you are 65. So who cares. It takes a few short years to fully recover from a major crash it's only relevant for old people planning to retire in that time window. But for you it's pointless to be so conservative. It's low risk no doubt. But there is no need to be so low risk. If you were going to retire in 10 years I would say ok that makes sense. But this makes none.
dwtawjj,I_inform_myself,"so, between my IRA and my 401K, i am set to have about 2 mil by 65 (less if I retire early).2 Mil by about 2057-58 will be worth the equivalent to about 785K now.Now, taken some good advice from my finance class, you want your investment to grow through retirement (since you don't have pull it all out when you retire).So it was said you want to have returns of 4% and only pull 3%.So, by the time I retire, 3% of 2 mil is $60,000 a year, or $23,500 now. So When I retire, I will basically have an income of $60K a year, plus social security (if it is still a thing). With my current contributions, and not getting a new job, or title change, and keeping a 2.5% raise each year.We were also told, not to have any outstanding debt when you retire. No mortgage, no car payments, no credit card debt. That way you can plan your retirement and still make money. But, I plan to get bigger raises, find a new job. Potentially go back to school and become a lawyer (practicing environmental law and workmen compensation). If I go that route, I highly doubt that I will need to really worry about my income, especially into retirement.But, even if I don't. I will be getting a new job within 5 years, and be making considerably more money to put away even more into retirement.I don't want to retire with 10s of millions, that will probably mean I have to worry about losing millions."

dwsspwj,Quadzilla_JR,Go ahead and explain that comment.
dwsu3k3,Randor0423,The amount of tarrifs are .03% if GDP for America...so the fact that China is performing retaliatory tarrifs will have no affect on the average schmo.Unfortunately what has affected the average Joe schmo is unfair trade practices by China that have stripped our industries. Especially Steel and Aluminum...The tarrifs that we are placing on China currently are because of their theft of intellectual property.
dwsulz3,Quadzilla_JR,Keep going; that does not even begin to explain how these tariffs on American goods will not have an effect on the average American Joe Schmoe.
dwsv69p,Randor0423,Oh...ok. Educate me oh wise one. Whats the worst case scenario on these tarriffs? Loss of production? Single handedly closing manufacturing plants?Or is the worst case that the tarriff is passed on to the Chinese consumer possibly making these US products uncompetitive.Would you prefer us to continually get taken advantage of? Whats your option B.
dwsw132,Quadzilla_JR,"I didn't say I had the answer to this very complex situation we are in with China, I asked you to explain your definitive comment that these tariffs would have no effect on the average American, and you still haven't. Changing the discussion does not answer my original question. These tariffs will raise the price of damn near everything for the end consumer in America, who can barely afford it as it is. When costs of production go up, the increase gets passed to the end consumer. When costs of goods go up, the increases get passed to the end consumer. This will be no different. The recent steel/aluminum tariff activity has already had a negative affect on me in my line of work; want to guess what we're doing with the price increases we're seeing from it?"

(That's even if the numbers are correct in the first place because when have we ever known trump or his people to lie to us?) But also, aren't you free market business loving people worried that whenever prices or costs go up, businesses with cut corners and lay off workers just so they can continue to pay shareholders? It's like when the airports decided to charge money for bags because of oil prices then when the prices went down the charges stuck around. So do not tell me what 0.03% on a trillion dollar economy won't affect the average person."
dwv7hlj,Amadacius,"Chinese retaliatory tariffs target volatile American Industries. Importing US soy is already of questionable benefit to Chinese markets. The tariff is designed to make American soy more expensive than growing the local industry. American tariffs won't work, America isn't 3 cents away from being the best place to produce these goods and they have no longevity. As soon as the tariffs lapse China goes back to being the best place to produce (assuming it wasn't when tariffs were in place). That isn't true the other way around. Once American made goods move overseas (pushed by Chinese tariffs) they are very unlikely to ever return. China has wanted to do stuff like this for a long time, they haven't been able to because it would appear exploitative and undermine international relations. Trump shooting blanks at China lets them fire slugs back while declaring it self defense. Trump rolled out these rules on a whim, but the Chinese tariffs have been on Xi's desk for a decade now."

You're full of crap, there were regulations put into to prevent the kind of manipulation that caused the crash, that has nothing to do with what GM did. Ford didn't even need a bailout because they successfully managed their company to prevent the damage from the recession. GM didn't, so we just give them money to compensate.So if GM was reckless with their money right now, and got themselves into another situation where they were on the verge of bankruptcy, you would then agree with bailing them out again.

It does depend on where you look at the starting points. You can't really blame him for the recession because he was voted in during it. You can't blame him on the first months to 1 year of his term for job loss because any policies need time to set in to see any effects.

Under Obama, there was the first positive job growth in manufacturing starting around the 2nd year till the end of his terms. A lot of this is due to China entering the World Trade Organization in 2001 so if you are looking at manufacturing job loss you should probably blame Bush instead who has over 15x the amount of losses if you look at day 1 for both of them or if you look at year 1 and on for both, Obama will be positive.https://www.aei.org/publication/october-2-is-manufacturing-day-so-lets-recognize-americas-world-class-manufacturing-sector-and-factory-workers/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/09/26/manufacturing-jobs-have-grown-more-under-obama-than-bush/?utm_term=.a0ec55006ecchttp://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/25/most-americans-unaware-that-as-u-s-manufacturing-jobs-have-disappeared-output-has-grown/"

I would like to add that although I was defending Obama in on this issue here, that doesn't mean that everything he did was the best choice or he was anywhere near close to perfect. I do lean left on most issues but that doesn't mean I even like either party due to how both sides use wedge issues to drum up votes and are both heavily influenced by political donations instead of the citizens who they are supposed to represent.Here is one example of a Democrat who has had $456k in donations from oil and gas groups and heavily favors pro oil and gas policy and is ranked as the worst Democrat in environmental issues. Although pushing for oil/coal/gas will create jobs in that sector, I feel that almost half a million dollars is a pretty nice reason to vote in favor of it.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Heitkamp#Energy_and_environmenthttp://www.ontheissues.org/International/Heidi_Heitkamp_Energy_+_Oil.htmhttps://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00033782&cycle=2018http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Heidi_Heitkamp_Environment.htmNo matter who you are, you shouldn't feel comfortable with any politicians whose campaigns are being paid for by corporations and billionaires because it is not your best interests they will be voting for. Personally I think that it would be better for everyone no matter what party if there was less lobbying and corporate donations to political leaders who are supposed to represent us. Right now, many news stations are owned by a single company who will give you highly biased news so it will be hard to see what is real and what is not. A good representation of this is the Sinclair Broadcast Group paying millions of dollers to own local stations who all use the same exact bias script to tell you that other stations give you ""false news"" and they will be reporting in your best interests due to them being the ""local station"". This is one of the most unnerving Black Mirror/George Orwell's 1984-esk videos of the propaganda machine I have seen when all over the country these news stations will be pushing whatever story they are told to say. Try to double check news/statistics from reliable sources because a lot of things you will hear will be ""alternative facts"".**I really hope you watch this 1m:39s video below**https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/980175772206993409This isn't a team sport or an us vs them situation, citizens should stand united against things like this. Even if I don't agree on certain issues like how to implement health care, it is pretty easy to agree that the US is spending way too much on health care (per capita GDP) while getting worse quality healthcare than other countries. While that happens, pharmaceutical companies pay millions to the people who are supposed to represent us who will not implement policies to reduce costs or prevent price gouging in drugs like Daraprim (HIV/AIDS drug that went from $13.50/pill to $750/pill) or that one company owning all the news stations to feed you the same bias message.http://www.commonwealthfund.org/~/media/images/publications/issue-brief/2015/oct/squires_oecd_exhibit_01.png?h=720&w=960&la=enhttp://money.cnn.com/2016/08/25/news/economy/daraprim-aids-drug-high-price/index.html"

dwshmbe,farmingdirt,"Thanks. I was fully aware of trump's hard stance on trade before the election and anyone with half a brain in agriculture was aware that we are a nation that needs to export grain. I didn't vote for him but I understood his appeal on many topics. Global grain production and imports and exports are TYPICALLY a zero sum game (hopefully). That is, China will take more soybeans from Brazil and Argentina (like they do every year already) and less from us. So this, in theory, will lead to higher prices in Brazil. That will lead other countries to buy from us instead of Brazil because of assumed price differences and so on and so forth. It doesn't always work that way and governments can get in the way of the free market sometimes.This was a vastly simplified version of things but I hope people get the point. China isn't going to starve their people and the rest of the world won't quit buying grain. Will these tariffs devastate US farmers? They might. They might also just cause short term disruption in the markets while the world shifts around where they get grain from. And I'd really like to add that China already has tariffs in place on soybeans."

dwsex0d,thurmanoliver,"Thanks so much man. I heard this last year and couldn't remember on what show and was really struggling on how to find it. I mean...this situation sucks a fat one, but thanks for coming through. Now to listen and get more depressed.

Not the same but still got me there though!"
dwsgl6z,2mice,for those of us who arent able to follow the link because of *insert excuse here*.what are some of the highlights of that listen?
dwshdff,GaydolphShitler,"TL;DL: Tariffs are generally a bad idea.Slightly longer version: placing a tariffs on imported widgets can offer protection to US widget producers by increasing the price to consumers of imported widgets. Unfortunately, if widgets are needed to manufacture doohickies, increasing the cost of widgets will fuck over the doohicky industry. If doohickies are a consumer product (extra points if they're something like gas or food that you can't really opt not to purchase), the added price will hurt consumers. If consumers have to spend more money on doohickies, they don't have as much money to spend on, say, widgets. Also, if doohickies are used in the supply chain for widgets, the widget tariff may end up *hurting* the widget industry by increasing their raw material costs. That's not even including the possibility of foreign counter-tariffs; if Country A increases tariffs to protect their domestic widget industry, the obvious choice for Country B is to simply apply their own tariffs on widgets exported from Country A. If the increase in local demand for widgets in A doesn't outpace the reduction in global widget demand (for example, if A exports more widgets to B than it imports), then the reduction in sales may end up screwing over the widget industry instead of helping it. Basically, the world economy is so interconnected nowadays that throwing tariffs around willy-nilly is a little like trying to hurt your neighbor by lighting their roof on fire. Except you live in a duplex."
dwsibkw,Red_Panda_420,"Upvoted for learning me, and for doohickies."
dwslmjx,99hoglagoons,"Not only that, but context of timing in that story is fascinating. In 1928 economy is booming. But farmers felt left out. So government decide to do some protectionism on farmers and next thing you know every industry wants it and they get it and there is a trade war everywhere and then...Greatest recession in US history."
dwuuu1d,2mice,i thought that was because of the dust bowl?
dwuwwmy,99hoglagoons,Dust bowl plays the part in history for sure. But in this particular instance farmers specifically wanted import taxes levied to foreign products.
dwsna9q,ToobieSchmoodie,So is there no positive that can come from these current tariffs? Or is it all bad news and Trump screwed us?
dwsxfgq,GaydolphShitler,"They don't really go into it in that podcast, but tariffs can be useful in certain circumstances. You just need to be *really* careful about how you use them, because they tend to have weird, unexpected consequences.For example: Country A's economy depends largely on widget production. Most of the widgets made there are consumed domestically (only a small portion are exported), and most of raw materials to make widgets are also produced domestically.Now, Country B enters the scene. They want their own widget industry to thrive for whatever reason (maybe they have a powerful widget lobby, or maybe they're doing it for strategic reasons), so they start subsidizing their own widget producers. Let's say they give them a 20% subsidy. That means widget producers in B can now sell their widgets at way lower prices than A's widget producers can.If B allows its producers to export their widgets (exported widgets would usually be excluded from the subsidy specifically to prevent this kind of trade dispute), the world widget market would suddenly be flooded with artificially cheap, B-made widgets. Consumers in Country A start buying these cheaper widgets, causing the domestic widget industry to tailspin. That would be a good reason for Country A to slap a tariff on widget imports from Country B; increasing the price of B's widgets by 20% would eliminate their unfair price advantage, allowing the domestic widget industry to compete on an even field again. In that case, B's move to export subsidized widgets would be a hostile trade action, and the tariff would just be return fire. Failure to do so could have disastrous consequences for A's economy, since the failure of the widget industry could very easily cause an economic death spiral.* This is called ""dumping,"" and it is usually countered with tariffsThis current situation is totally different though:1) It isn't a tariff on one particular thing, but on a wide swath of products. The wider the tariffs are, the weirder, larger, and harder to predict the effects will be. Even without a reaction from China, chances are a lot of these tariffs would end up having serious negative consequences for the US. 2) In the case of the steel an aluminum tariffs, Trump wasn't totally wrong; China has arguably been dumping steel and aluminum in the US and other markets for decades. However, he seems to have missed the fact that the US is a massive metal *importer,* and our domestic steel and aluminum production industries are tiny compared to the industries that consume metals. What that means is Trump just jacked up the prices of the raw materials needed by a huge sector of the economy in order to protect the much, much smaller industries which produce those materials. What's more, the steel and aluminum industries also rely equipment produced by the metal consuming industries these tariffs are raising the prices on. That means that while it could theoretically help their sales, it will make buying new equipment way more expensive. And they're going to have to buy a lot of equipment, because they're going to have to increase production MASSIVELY to accommodate the increased demand for US made raw materials. Again, even without a response from China, Trump just shot himself in the dick with that one.3) A lot of the things we import from China are mass market consumer items, and a lot of the things China imports from us are luxury items. We buy things like machinery components (think radiators, switches, gears, belts, etc), basic consumer items (toothbrushes, straws, flashlights, computer keyboards, dildos, etc.), electronics (smartphones and PC components for days), and raw materials (steel, aluminum, lithium, rare earth metals, plastics, etc.). They buy stuff from us like cigars, motorcycles, whisky, and cars. They also buy commodities like soybeans, chemicals, wheat, etc, but there are plenty of other sources for those materials (although costs may rise somewhat). If rich Chinese people can't get reasonably priced American cigars and Harleys, they'll just buy Cubans and Triumphs instead. On the other hand, alot of the stuff Trump is placing tariffs on don't really have solid domestic pipelines to replace them. In summary, Trump barreled right past any potential diplomatic resolution to our trade disputes with China and jumped directly into a totally unnecessary trade war. Not only that, but the actions he's taking are extremely stupid even if you ignore the Chinese counterpunch. He's obviously convinced himself that he knows more about economics than the economists, and he's obviously the only person he has convinced of that.In fact, I'd like to revise my earlier analogy. This isn't like hurting your duplex neighbor by lighting your own roof on fire; this is more like taking vengeance on your roommate for eating your ice cream sandwiches by eating their leftovers, then lighting yourself on fire inside your own locked room. HA! *That* will show them. *Here's what I mean by ""death spiral:"" the collapse of the widget industry causes a reduction in tax revenues and a spike in unemployment simultaneously. The welfare system suddenly needs to support way more people than usual, but the government has less money to pay for it. At the same time, all those unemployed people stop spending money. That means less people buying things, and sections of the economy completely unrelated to widget production start to feel the strain as well. With reduced revenues and a huge glut of unemployed people looking for work, companies can't/don't need to pay their employees nearly as well, and wages start to tank. That further reduces revenue, and the cycle continues. It's a feedback loop:1) People spend less money and stop buying as many things.2) Companies reduce wages, lay people off, or close their doors due to reduced revenue3) Repeat."

However manufacturing just became less viable because the higher price of metals which means tens of thousands to maybe a hundred thousand jobs just disappeared.

dx0hau3,ItzSnakeMeat,"This is coming from a perspective that business is redemptive no matter what. Not only that it ignores the fact that if this is a ""Trade War"" we already know it will be costly, the question is who will it be most costly to? There are certainly some positives to less cheap Chinese electronics being mass produced only to break and be replaced filling up our oceans and landfills with crap and forcing people to pay a higher premium for consumer goods they didn't need in the first place. Then there is the security concern of millions of Americans buying tainted products out of Foxconn (proprietary code leaks there have caused major damage to average American lives). I have no affection for Trump at all but the left all the sudden turns up FOR big business it's seems when it might serve to degrade the Commander in Tweet. Maybe we should consider the ethical implications of promoting business that is likely not good in any other sense than dollars and cents. Further, war means losses on both sides so its at least a more complicated move than a purely economic blunder. You have not addressed that. I don't really give a shit if people's stocks will take a hit. The strength of capitalism has always been that it puts distance between you and the losers you're exploiting. Handing cash over to businesses that aren't reinvesting your money in jobs, infrastructure, better products/services but rather paying themselves and shareholders while they do bad shit against public interest is our fault too. Let's not be naive and examine tariffs as if their impetus and outcomes are purely economic. That is reductionist and a fool's game. I'm not qualified to speak more than somewhat broadly on America vs. China economic strategy but I think there's a decent chance the overall goal is to protect American economic hegemony globally in the long run. Trump is likely and idiot but that doesn't mean this was even his idea. Perhaps you could elaborate on how damaging this may be to China or at least the impact of this decision more broadly to economic alone? My understanding is the Chinese command economy has been producing the Lion's share of the world's debt and thus, a major hit to production could spiral the forced March of their economic engine into a ""death spiral""."

dwsjfue,FblthpLives,"It may be shorter this time around: In 2002, Europe filed a complaint with Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade Organization. The WTO determined the tariffs were illegal and authorized retaliatory tariffs. That process took up 7 out of the 8 months. Once Europe announced retaliatory tariffs, the U.S. capitulated a month later. Conversely, working against you this time is the fact that the current U.S. President is not rational.

dx12vgq,pm_your_lifehistory,"Look, my point is simple: if the leftwing in the US is supposed to look at individuals and not groups then the rightwing should do the same.So if I am not allowed to start talking smack about people in the bible belt they shouldn't be able to sit there and start attacking Muslims and pretend that one child molester proves that all gay people are evil. This is a two way street. I think that is as clear as I can make my point."
dx21r4t,Tasgall,"I (think?) I get your logic here, but it's pretty bad thinking and isn't at all helpful in the grand scheme of things.We are literally talking about someone who is against pretty much everything the GOP stands for. Generalizing them into a group they are *explicitly against* is just outright stupid. Even racist as fuck shitters will make exceptions when they personally know ""one of the good ones"".And just because a group of morally reprehensible and shitty people do it doesn't mean you should too."

Someone should buy Airbus stock now.Good luck to Apple, not only losing out on the biggest consumer market but potentially their supply chain.Doesn't Trump know that a significant portion of the trade imbalance was caused by companies like Apple who ultimately pocketed the profit?"

He thinks too small.This is the best explanation I've seen, from Jack Ma (founder of Alibaba) at the WEF: https://youtu.be/Q-0jbIC4yigBasically: outsourcing shitty jobs to developing countries and keeping all the high-margin work for yourself is what made the USA so rich. It's a great strategy. The rest of the world would love to break it up. Trump is undoing generations of US economic development."
dwsj6em,iamwhoiamamiwhoami,"There's a great documentary called Life and Debt that details how the US, through the World Bank, has managed to hold a thumb on Jamaica, keeping them a low-cost manufacturer indefinitely. Honestly, it borders on slavery it's so bad."
dwsmqop,4th-Chamber,It is slavery. Just like there is wage slavery in the US there is one-step-removed chattel slavaery for developing nations.
dwt5n3x,Mapleleaves_,"Same way Hanes and Levi Strauss worked with the US Embassy to diminish a minimum wage hike in Haiti. Haitian textile workers are some of the lowest paid in the Western hemisphere and our government worked to keep it that way. Something to consider when your uncle calls it a ""shithole country""."
dwsuw8e,pigrc,"America never banned slavery, it just changed it a little. Example: prison industry"
dwsjw40,AtheistAustralis,"Yup. Trying to bring low value manufacturing jobs back to the US is like a the $1000/hr lawyer firing the kid next door from cutting his grass and doing it himself to save $5. Congratulations, you saved $5, but lost $2000 in the time it took you to do it yourself.What the US should be doing is keep importing cheap goods from China, and work on increasing the volume of high-value, high-profit exports to other countries (and China as well, naturally). Of course this relies on a highly educated and well trained workforce, which in turn relies on a huge investment in education. Oops.The US became the economic powerhouse of the world by expanding its manufacturing base massively when other countries didn't (or couldn't), putting them way ahead of the game in productivity. Having enormous stockpiles of easily extracted natural resources (hello oil!) also helped a lot. They stayed ahead by being one of the first to transfer into the new economy of high tech goods, software, service industries, R&D, finance and IP, while other countries were catching up with manufacturing. Now it seems the aim is to go back in the other direction again to ""regain"" manufacturing jobs. I can't wait until 2050, when 80% of the US workforce is back in agriculture again.."
dwsy09s,Dworgi,"The biggest problem with this strategy (and don't get me wrong, it's a good strategy) is that it leaves behind the other half of the normal distribution. Not everyone can program or act in movies. Where Europe has differed while following the same strategy is that they have a social safety net, so there isn't as much backlash from rural regions and the uneducated. What's good for the economy is good for the safety net, which is good for them.You can see this exact phenomenon in European and American politics. Where Europe is overwhelmingly liberal and much less polarised, the US is completely divided. While Trump and his supporters have a misguided about the solution, they're not completely off base about the problem.Agricultural and manufacturing jobs are in stark decline, which threatens their way of life, but that's by design. Restoring coal and factory jobs seems like a logical solution, but it runs counter to the strategy."
dwt3886,Icemasta,"Well, the classic idea is that specialization of the population would help transition away from the need of manufacturing jobs and what not and that service jobs would cover the lower end, but that was with several assumptions that aren't happening. For instance, the rate of education and the cost of education was assumed to lower over time as the population grew more specialized, but we saw the opposite; education cost is rising, which creates stagnation. Lower specialization jobs such as service and manufacturing jobs are getting replaced by automation and corporate optimization faster than the specialized market is growing. It's not so say that countries aren't making progress there, just that it isn't happening evenly, so you get people that are left behind, or for the US, you get the ""hole in the middle"", where people of ""middle education"", like college, come out of school with large debts for salaries that aren't much better than minimum wage. Like right now, there is a sweet spot in trade jobs like plumber, electrician, etc... because of the aging population and those are the kind of things that can't be automated, it's also the kind of job that went unpopular for a long time thanks to mainstream media. It's an interesting thing to witness though. In the next 20 years, there will be big shifts in the job market."
dwsx4vw,ChrisTosi,"> I can't wait until 2050, when 80% of the US workforce is back in agriculture again..With roughly the same yield as today. Somehow."

dwt2ogq,zebra-in-box,"But if you keep them poor and uneducated then they'll keep voting for your regressive policies and never have enough money or ideas to influence public policy in their favor! It's like 21st century democratic serfdom. That folks, is the art of the deal."
dwt8czv,RainbeeL,"Well, your president and the elite think the Chinese and other countries are stealing your IP, and the US don't want to continue to stay in the high end of the world economy. I think the Americans just don't feel that confident over the others now. For me (not an American), real IP can never be stolen. Many Chinese tried hard to copy Apple, Microsoft and Intel's technology and designs, but the Chinese actually loves the pruducts from these companies even more than before."
dwsyd9w,sharknado,"> Congratulations, you saved $5, but lost $2000 in the time it took you to do it yourself.He only loses $2,000 if he mowed the grass in lieu of doing billable work. If he was just sitting at home doing nothing, he saves $5 and doesn't lose anything. Not to mention he doesn't get to keep most of his billing rate anyway."
dwt085t,Icemasta,"In economics you work on the basis of opportunity cost, that's what his example represented.The gist of it is any work done comes at the expense of something else."
dwt0kb3,sharknado,"Let's say that something else was sitting at home on a Saturday, reading a newspaper. Nothing lost, $5 gained. Just because a lawyer bills at $1,000 an hour doesn't mean all of his time is worth $1,000 an hour. Not all time at work is billable for one, and leisure time is especially not billable. OP was assuming the lawyer had billable work he was not doing instead of mowing, I'm assuming he's home doing nothing."
dwt1e7y,Icemasta,"Your whole assumption is irrelevant because we compare amount of works to amount of works.You're trying to compare amount of works to ""free time"", that's like comparing apples to oranges, because you could apply that same mentality to everything to ultimately say that you could find someone to do everything for free.In economics, you need a baseline of comparison, that's what opportunity cost is. His example was representing that aspect, you're taking under the assumption that mowing lawn wasn't work. The point is since the lawyer, to mow his lawn, had to *work* 1 hour, he could have instead done his real job and earned 1000$. Because we're comparing work to work."
dwt1tbn,sharknado,"That lawyer isn't making $1000 an hour, he's just billing clients at $1000 an hour. Most of that goes to paying overhead costs, secretary salary, file clerks, support staff, software licenses, etc. No one makes their billing rate as a salary, we all wish that were the case. Secondly, if a lawyer doesn't have billable work in front of them to do instead of mowing, their time isn't worth dick. The end."
dwt2ava,Icemasta,"Lmao, that's some good ol' talking nonsense if I've ever seen someone. Let's make up a very specific scenario where the analogy used by a poster wouldn't work.It's fine if you don't understand how it works, ya know."
dwt2rep,sharknado,"I have a billing rate of 400/hr. When I'm at home, I'm not making anything. If I wash my own dishes, I'm not losing money. If there's no billable work to be done, you aren't losing anything by doing another task. That analogy only applies if you could have made money doing billable work instead."
dwt3ecn,Icemasta,"Well then think that the analogy had billable work waiting then? All you're doing is playing ""What ifs"" with no goal in mind but being a semantic prick. The analogy presented was to example the simple system of opportunity cost yet your rambling on about things that are completely unrelated."

Also, the kid next door sometimes has questionable grass cutting practices."
dwsjd6k,DriftCatchers,"It's made the top 1% of the US so rich. Incomes haven't risen significantly for the majority of American workers since ‘79. So yeah, globalization has been pretty alright but it's come with the cost of safe, well-paying industrial jobs and relative income equity."

dwslrhv,Andy_Schlafly,"Globalization only works if the benefits are evened out.

dwsxhis,FelneusLeviathan,Plus it's one of those basic ideas behind economics that people/countries/etc do what they're good at and when you trade with people who are good at one thing but not at another (at which you are good at) everyone wins.

dwsxymw,geekboy69,"First consider that source. Secondly that may be what made a select few in America rich, but it mostly lost high paying manufacturing jobs in the US. Ultimately hurting US citizens. I know as much about trade as any other jamoke on Reddit, but I do think that the amount of outcry is simply cuz Trump is president.

dwsjsvu,Cudois47,“Doesn't trump know...”The answer to that question is always “no”.
dwsxn5q,geekboy69,I think they amount of exports the US has to China is significantly less than what China exports to the US. And on top that the examples of these large multinational corporations that will suffer don't seem like things that will ultimately affect the average US citizen. Isn't apple sitting on billions of dollars? It's not like they are shelling out dough to employees so they can spend it and help the economy
dwt2luu,Jaeger168,"Your thinking is somewhat closely aligned with Donald's. It doesn't work that way because of globalization. Do you consider Apple iPhone an US export or Chinese export when an average Chinese consumer buys it? What about Boeing aircraft with thousands of parts procured globally. There is no winner in trade war, the worse thing can happen to US and Chinese companies is losing the respective market."
dwtx3to,geekboy69,Maybe my thinking is aligned with Trump's. I just find it comical that everyone is like this is so bad when none of these redditors are economists or trade experts. To me some of it makes sense. If Obama decided that we needed to make a change in trade the reaction would be way different. This is part of what Trump campaigned on and why he won so there definitely are many people who think this is the right move.

dwsf86u,LOLingMAO,Can I ask why? It just seems that you're ignoring the fact that some of our largest companies are gonna lose a lot of money.
dwsg3ee,Spartan448,"GM has been a zombie of a corporation for a long time. What used to be one of the biggest names in US autos is now barely a presence. Their products are terrible, their sales presence almost nonexistent, and they barely employ anyone in the US anymore. They should have died in the '08 crisis, but the government bailed them out. Boeing is a defense contractor, and an important one at that with regards to China. The big draw for being an American ally in the SEA region is we make planes - planes that are far and away better than anything the Chinese even plan on having, to the degree that even a smaller airforce using American warplanes is more than a match for the PLAAF. This can change very quickly if Boeing exports planes to China and accidentally ends up forwarding their knowledge of advanced systems, aerodynamics, and metallurgy. Apple as a corporation purely exists to scam people out of obscene amounts of money. There are exactly ZERO Apple products on the market whose job isn't done as well if not better for less than half the cost and less than half the complexity. Their entire business model is predatory and they are almost singularly responsible for many of the negative trends in both their industry and Silicon Valley a a whole. They make Zuckerberg look like a fucking saint."

dwsiari,srv340mike,"The US doesn't sell military aircraft to China, and I seriously doubt that the Chinese are going to the capable of military benefitting much from airliners, which have a drastically different design philosophy then military aircraft."
dwsphqh,Spartan448,I'm not saying they are going to sell military aircraft to China. But saying you can't get any military benefit from reverse engineering another country's aircraft is just delusional.
dwspp8c,srv340mike,"The design philosophies are completely different. 787's aren't going to help China with designing fighters, and I say the while considering the fact that the Chinese are notorious for reverse engineering. I'd be far more concerned that they reverse engineer Boeing products to produce their own airliners like they did with the DC9/ARJ than I would be that they'll benefit militarily."
dwsq2mf,Spartan448,"Design philosophy doesn't matter, it's the tech that goes into the final product that matters. Every sensor, every surface, every engine that's better than what they can make on their own for the civilian market, they will reverse engineer and use it to improve their own military kit."
dwsqh8x,srv340mike,"There's not a whole lot on a civilian airliner that's going to benefit them for military aircraft, though. Avionics are avionics, there's nothing about the avionics on a modern Boeing airliner that so revolutionary that it's already better than what the Chinese already have. The main advantage of modern airliners is the engines and the composites, which have different intentions for military and civilian aircraft. There's nothing the Chinese are going to get from new Boeings that's going to help their air force that they don't already have access to from stuff the buy from the Russians."

dwspcz4,Spartan448,"GM's jobs will leave anyway, their company isn't sustainable at this point. They needed a bailout for a reason, and that reason had nothing to do with being successful and everything to do with being a colossal failure of a company. All it is right now is executives trying to squeeze as much money out of a brand as possible before selling it off. Better for them to go under now while they're in debt to the government and we can repossess all their assets and sell them off. As for Apple, their entire business model is based on abusing and exploiting consumers. I've no sympathy for anyone who willingly chooses to work for them, and we'll all be better off if Apple were to disappear."

dwsjre7,iamwhoiamamiwhoami,"> This can change very quickly if Boeing exports planes to China and accidentally ends up forwarding their knowledge of advanced systems, aerodynamics, and metallurgy.Uhhh... So you're main worry here stems from a belief that Boeing may accidentally send over plans for a military plane when shipping over aircraft and parts? That seems pretty unlikely. You're essentially saying you want a major US company to ignore a nation that holds 20% of the human population. That may have been fine when they were a undeveloped nation, but they are now emerging as one of the top developed nations. You're saying US companies should ignore 20% of the global marketplace because of an idiotic theory about leaking plans that will surely never even happen? Good news for Airbus I guess."
dwsovht,Spartan448,"No, my worry stems from the fact that Boeing will send them a completed civilian airliner and from that the Chinese will reverse engineer the technology that goes into the electronics and fuselage of the aircraft. No market share is worth losing military superiority. It's not worth losing the tactical and strategic advantages we would need to rely on in a conflict just to make a few extra bucks."
dwspivr,OrginalCanadian,They already have that knowledge though...They have been buying planes for years now.
dwsr1tv,iamwhoiamamiwhoami,"Is this a joke? You're worried about losing the strategic military advantage of a 787 Dreamliner? I'm afraid it's a bit too late for that, as Chinese airlines already have fleets of such aircraft. Fear not though, as I don't believe anyone in their right mind would try to use such aircraft for aerial combat."

I was sorely disappointed when Branstad came out in outspoken opposition against Cruz and in support of Trump, owing to Cruz' honesty about the economics of ethanol. Branstad -- and ultimately the GOP -- lost an immense amount of respect in Iowa from principled conservatives over this. It made it clear that Branstad was playing a short-sighted political game. I think it's almost poetic that Branstad opposed Cruz because for fear it would threaten ethanol subsidy, only now to have Trump completely upset the soybean market. The GOP sold its soul this election. Sow the wind, and you reap the whirlwind."

dwslthh,rivermandan,"I hear ya but you have to realize how many eu only ford vehicles there are, half the small american cars out these days started their lives as EU models."
dwsvs6e,Fresherty,"You know those cars sold in America actually are quite different to their European counterparts right? EU Focus and American Focus share some parts, but at large are different car."
dwsvq2k,Fresherty,"Tesla is both exception to the rule, and yet still it manages to be 'one size to big' for average EU consumer. Even Model 3 is on upper end of what's popular size-wise. Think of it that way - if you go through most popular models sold in Europe last year, you'll see majority are in B segment (Polo, Fiesta, 208, Clio) or slightly larger C segment (Golf, Focus, Civic). Model 3 is D segment car, which is much less popular. To give you some idea: VW sold 500k of Golf last year in Europe, and only 180k of Passat.Not even mentioning current pricing which basically limits its buyers to 1%-ers and Norwegians. Meanwhile European (and Asian) car makers are already introducing appropriately sized and priced vehicles that can easily compete on features relevant to EU market. And those vehicles are selling quite a bit - like smart fortwo electric drive or VW eGolf."
dwsfzpv,Holy_Grail_Reference,Exactly. I just returned from Ireland last Friday and I can assure you that even my Honda Accord is too large for those roads. We have no real market there.

dwsilgk,Muckarat93,Why? I'd rather just wait for the Mission E than buy a shit Tesla. Their quality control is absolutely horrible.
dwsjhmd,PresumedSapient,"Don't read too much into it, it was a response to the doubt whether Europeans would buy US cars. Slightly joking too, since A) Tesla sells everything it can produce, and B) Tesla isn't usually considered 'part of the club' of US car companies (which supposedly would attempt to dump their production on Europe, which can't happen anyway since cars made for the US or Chinese market aren't approved or wanted here anyway) .On the subject of electric vehicles, I wouldn't spend money on a Porsche either. Rather something like a Renault ZOE, more affordable and practical for everyday transit. I just want to get from A to B."

dwsg3ir,Was0ry,I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Are you talking about resellers ?
dwsgl4d,nekoazelf,"Its because they will dump the excess stock of tariff-ed goods onto the European market. The EU, in response, will impose protective tariffs against both the US and China to ensure that their markets do not get flooded by cheap goods which can hurt domestic producers/manufacturers."
dwsiz9l,chochochan,"Ah right, that makes sense. Thanks"
dwsjeo9,dinosaurs_quietly,"Economics is all about price points. If the US reduces prices in Europe due to excess supply, more Europeans will buy American cars."
dwslv2r,kalesaji,Nah it wouldnt because American cars suck cock compared to European or Japanese cars
dwsefy5,perigon,"The only way Europeans would buy more American cars is if they were suddenly made much cheaper. So it might hurt European car companies, but the consumers would benefit from much cheaper prices. Even then, a lot of American cars are just to expensive to run on our roads because of carbon taxes."
dwsjuzl,Hardly_lolling,"True, however EU is not a bystander waiting to see if it needs tarifs due to dumping: Trump also threatened EU and it will put its own tarifs on US products regardless of US/China situation if Trump doesn't back down."
dwsmuia,ACatWithThumbs,"The US could never compete with European car companies inside of Europe where the single market makes it tariff and barrier free to sell between the countries.Not to mention that those cars just aren‘t popular in Europe as the gas prices are much higher than the US.Europeans like smaller, efficient, fast cars, that are stick shift, and are in line with the European infrastructure and regulations.Most US cars are the exact opposite of that.Chevrolet will not suddenly make small efficient cars for Europeans that are better than the compete tariff VW‘s.And the European car companies are not just going to stand still, they will react to anything the US does, as will the Korean and Japanese car companies."
dwsh1bj,GalwayUW,"There are way more European car consumers than car producers. If the Americans managed to undersell European car companies, the average consumer will be better off. Cheaper goods and more options are always better for the people. Millions of people benefit at the expense of a few. It also puts pressure on European car companies to innovate.Edit: not meaning to say I disagree that that will happen. Just saying that European governments would be advised not to introduce or increase tariffs. But they're also probably also under lobbying pressure from their car companies do fat chance that will happen."
dwsifoi,tinygirlbigheart,1 in 7 German jobs is connected to the German car industry. The biggest economy in the EU definitely will not be better off if German carmakers are struggling.
dwsk5ht,GalwayUW,7 out of 7 German workers would benefit from cheaper auto prices. Not to mention the rest of the EU. Protectionism is never a sound economic policy.
dwsmf67,tinygirlbigheart,Not if they're unemployed. Plus cars are not necessary like they are in the US. The German industry as a whole is driven by the automotive industry. I almost agree with you protectionism to a certain extent is necessary but we are only retaliating to Trump's madness.
dwsdyvm,bartlet4us,"China and the US are such giants in the global economy that this kind of trade war hurts basically every nation who has a high dependency on trades in their GNP.

dwscbg3,Mad_Maddin,Not necessarily. Let's say the USA imports certain materials from China to then manufacture something and sell to the EU. Now the manufactured stuff will be more expensive in the EU as they can't do it as cheap anymore. Also China and USA may try to dump their stuff to other countries which could also hurt their local economy.
dwsgk7z,GaydolphShitler,"No, realistically this will fuck damn near everyone in the ass. The US and China produce a huge amount of manufactured goods which they then export to the rest of the world. If the cost of raw materials goes up due to tariffs, the cost of manufactured products will go up as well. China and the US also consume a massive portion of the world's exports, so any damage to their economies will seriously fuck up a lot of exporting countries.The exact impact of tariffs have historically been very difficult to predict due to the complexity of global markets, but it's a pretty safe bet that this time around the effects are going to ripple far further than they have in the past. The supply chains for most industries nowadays are global, massively complex, and fairly fragile. Imagine the world economy as a street performer with a bunch of spinning plates on sticks. While predicting the exact effect of a trade war between the US and China, the global effects will be pretty similar to walking up to that plate spinner and punting him in the wedding tackle."
dwscxwm,raymond8505,"would it be profitable to become a middle man in Europe, marking up the products from both countries just enough to be less than the tariffs incurred from direct purchase, or is that margin not high enough?"

dwu9zv1,hicow,"Quite right. The real takeaway from that article is that Trump supporters are selfish, ignorant, middle-class racists."
dws8xgj,JetsFanInDenver,Chinese economy would go massively downward. China is not stipid enough to do that.
dwsbo11,bittabet,"It'd be very bad for their economy but not enough to make it ""massively downward."" Exports only make up about 18% of China's GDP and of those exports only about a fifth go to the US. So even if China lost every single export to the US their GDP would only be hit by about 4% and chances are that they'd just make up for a fair amount of it with increased exports to other countries so the actual hit would likely be a lot lower. The US doesn't really have as much leverage as most Americans think."
dwsfdb1,azuresou1,A 4% GDP drop is fucking massive
dwsg6a5,sauas-kraut,"According to google china's GDP 2016 was 11,2 Trillion USD. 4% of that is almost 450 Billion. That would be an insane loss."
dwsm33v,Conjwa,"Chinese exports to the US actually account for $650 billion, or 6% of their GDP. Meanwhile US exports to China total about $100 billion, or 0.5% of our GDP. People are ignoring this because they want to bash Trump and act like China is capable of dick-slapping us in this trade war, but the truth is they have far more to lose in this scenario than the US does, and both sides know it.Not that it's going to make the ride any less bumpy."
dwsn3pq,EngineerKE,"The question should be, how much of the US economy does the $650billion in Chinese exports to the US affect? It's easy to look at it on face value and say that China will lose all that money in exports but you also have to consider how critical those exports are to US businesses and how long before those businesses can find profitable alternatives. People don't look towards China because they're lovely people. They choose China because of their extensive manufacturing base and potential for very cheap products. So, it's not as cut and dry as simply the import/export figures to the respective countries"
dwsnbkz,Conjwa,"Oh yes 100% agreed. Ironically, it will be the US-imposed tariffs that damage the US economy by making it tougher to buy Chinese goods, much moreso than the Chinese imposed tariffs, which will be damaging to those industries but have a negligible impact on overall growth."
dwsocy0,CookedStew,I want to add something to this discussion by asking what would happen if these industries instead started buying from other countries like vietnam and india? Wouldn't it be better for the global economy if more countries were to be a part of this trade instead of just china? This would also negate some of the damage that the us economy would recieve from not importing wares from china anymore no?
dwsqe8e,Conjwa,"Yes, but it takes years (and tons of money) to get large scale manufacturing facilities up and running, and a workforce trained."
dwsqm5s,EngineerKE,"Yes, while it'll be damaging in the short-term for those Chinese industries, they will able to find substitute markets for those good in some developing markets. I feel that is one of the reasons why China has committed to the the One Belt One Road initiative. To reduce to some extent the dependency of the economy on US imports by investing in these developing markets. A significant majority of construction machinery in Africa is Chinese-made, whereas 10-15 years ago, Komatsu and Caterpillar were dominant. Same thing with lorries, primarily involved in construction projects. The telecoms market is also predominantly Chinese, with the dominant cellphone brands catering to the poor and middle class being of Chinese origin. You can find the same thing in the South-East Asian economies. The Chinese were going to diversify from the US eventually but it seems that Trump's actions might push up the schedule."
dwssh9u,Conjwa,"But, the GDP of the entire continent of Africa is only something like $3.3 trillion, whereas the US's is around $20 trillion. I can't speak to the GDP of Southeast Asia, but finding a market to replace the US is, in my (admittedly US-centric) opinion, a much taller order than finding other countries who are willing to manufacture our goods."
dwswmqe,EngineerKE,"Yeah, but consider that the room for growth in Africa is huge. It's why the US and China are basically battling it out for control right now. Look at just how many countries the Chinese are investing in. As you've said, it's a tall order for the Chinese to find a market replacement for the US. But it's not really a path to replacement in as much as it is them hedging against US economic hegemony. With the recent intra-African free trade deal, assuming discipline is maintained between signatories, Africa's GDP is set to rise significantly over the next 2 decades or so. This makes it a ripe market for Chinese goods. While the US bars Huawei's telecoms technology, they find a big market in African countries in need of such infrastructure. And with the Chinese always playing the long game, their industries are set to find big markets in developing countries. That's their long-term target. Same thing with SE Asia. They're taking advantage of infrastructure needs in countries like Vietnam, the Philippines and Pakistan to expand their industries. Cutting loose dependency on the US off as a trading partner sounds far fetched when you look at it across the next 5 years. But once you start looking 20-30 years, factoring in growth of the African Economy, rise of Chinese geopolitical influence across the Indian ocean, Chinese infrastructure projects across developing countries and the subsequent influx of Chinese goods, the strategic network of Chinese funded/acquired ports, and the massive investment of critical infrastructure (rail and road networks) from resource-rich areas leading to China, you can see the likelihood of it happening. It may not happen any time soon, but China is preparing for the moment when they can decisively dictate the global economic tempo."
dwt1xzs,Sandslinger_Eve,"Good thing for China that the U.S. has also started a trade war with the EU, which in turn has caused the leaders of that union to unilaterally state that they should look towards creating closer ties to China.If I wanted to design the perfect way to crush half a century of financial dominance this is how I would go about it."
dwt2aqf,Conjwa,"Where have they said this genuinely, and not merely as threats/posturing?It makes absolutely 0 financial sense. ""Ok, United States. You guys are charging a 2.5% tariff on cars now? Well fine, we'll just get our cars from China, who is charging a 25% tariff on cars!"" If the EU has issues with economic protectionism, China is **literally** the last country on earth they would look to do business with."
dwtt40a,Tasgall,> Not that it's going to make the ride any less bumpy.Or any less pointless...
dwt9yxu,nokipro,"I completely agree with you. To further it, China is still trying to fill the capacity in their manufacturing facilities. Sometimes they take business at cost or at a loss to keep scale. Losing any significant business can really hurt some of their heavier debt laiden companies(which is bad when their debt to gdp ratio is already very large). Not saying we don't have debt laiden companies, just less start ups here due to the different policy execution implemented by each country during the '08 recession."
dwsmkv8,Fight_Me_Mr_Tusk,But a portion of that 4% would be sold elsewhere. So it wouldn't even be the full 450bn. China could make up for it at the very least. An embargo would absolutely hurt the US substantially more than it would China.

dwsgh8h,epicwinguy101,"Right, but even if they don't export *that much*, they're still exporting far more to us than we are to them. Their trade surplus is over $250 billion, and their GDP is still substantially smaller, so on the balance they still have more to lose than us. There are many places to make cheap goods, there's far fewest strong consumer markets. Also, consider that your 4% doesn't account for intranational business used to make a product ready for export. For instance, if company A sells plastic widgets, and buys plastic raw materials from company B, that transaction is still part of the export process, but not included in your 4%."
dwso7yf,carpenterio,"Well it's more difficult than that, China still lead manufacturing of electronics and clothings and other stuff, lets say tomorrow the US and China stop trading, China would be much better off and will sell to the rest of the world, meanwhile the US won't have anywhere to get certain products and will devastate the economy in maybe 1 month? I don't think it's only about money, but what kind of goods you are getting."
dwsovck,epicwinguy101,"[Chinese companies have taken on a lot of debt for expanding](http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/CHINA-DEBT-GRAPHIC/0100315H2LG/), and their total private debt is at pretty precarious levels. If these enterprises can't generate the money to pay this borrowing back, China is going to have a huge disaster on its hands, and losing what is by far the largest consumer market in the world would pretty much ensure many these companies wouldn't make ends meet anymore with these piles of debt. Despite having a large economy, only a small fraction of it is consumer spending, they really need exports to keep afloat. Clothing can be made anywhere, and it's really easy to set up new shops. We won't be running around naked. Electronics less so, but we do retain that manufacturing capability here, and I think that we can scale up production suitably given time. Given China's blatant disregard for IP, this might be better for us overall. I don't disagree that we will take a hit, perhaps a very large one if this escalates, but the US economy is still much bigger and healthier than China's overall; we can take a hit right now and survive. We have a healthy consumer market and can import cheap goods from a lot of countries. It will make people unhappy in the short term, but ending China's trade abuses (not just to us, but every one of their partners) and maybe nipping their Belt and Road doctrine in the bud would be better overall down the road."

dwt9t3y,carpenterio,"China invest billions in research facilities, schools and factories. No way any other country can keep up.

It's all done now and pretty obvious, no one wants to deal with trump and the rest of the world is moving on. Of course I am not an expert and I could be wrong."
dws9dvq,joblessnerd,No it won't. No company is going to stop importing stuff just because of a few % taxes on it. Companies won't stop importing till they have manufacturing facilities in the US or other countries that are cheap. And it will take a few years to do that.
dwsfk5t,bhu87ygv,Dude said embargo though.
dwsfqoy,joblessnerd,damn. i must have overlooked that part.
dwswbb8,ImNotArmenian,Don't be too hard on yourself. A full Chinese embargo would probably collapse China way faster than it collapses the US so it's understandable how your mind skipped over the utterly absurd idea that they would do that to themselves.
dwsfy8a,LemonyFresh,"In the short term it would serve to make China's goods less competitive against other markets such as India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Philipines etc. Even if it did take a couple of years for these countries to ramp up their manufacturing base it would still mean China is giving their competitors a leg-up.Of course it's bad for the US in the short term, but China isn't getting off scott-free either."

dwt8lxy,AidenTai,They're not talking about it because it's not really in the cards. Would hurt China tremendously and is not a suitable response according to WTO rules.
dwtluxk,HistoricVesselVega,It would hurt China but have US business on its knees within 90 days. As to WTO... who was first to ignore those rules?
dwtmho9,AidenTai,"China doesn't want to break WTO rules though, as it and the EU are precisely signaling the US that it needs to abide by WTO rules. How would it make sense to break WTO rules in order to make the US follow them? This would be a dire escalation on China's part and it could face retaliatory action not just in the form of US tariffs. No, the EU and China are taking tit‐for‐tat measures to try to push the US back in line with respect to international trade rules and they'll both respect these rules in doing so."
dwto05z,HistoricVesselVega,I think this entire thing is a huge mess that never needed to exist in the first place. My point was purely rhetorical in nature.
dwsh4vw,kickasstimus,"That would be a mess.Think about the container shipping companies like Hapag-Lloyd, and the. FedEx, UPS, DHL, etc. With the sudden glut of containers available, the price of shipping drops and kills off many companies. Now there's a glut of ships, aircraft, and fuel going unused. Railroads suffer immediately with a lack of business and dramatically reduce staff. That causes a domino effect as service companies are forced to reduce staff to stay afloat. This would happen globally. The wealthy would be fine. Literally everyone else would suffer."

dwtmrls,HistoricVesselVega,China has a surplus they can fall back on and trillions in US treasury bills they can flog. Think long term. China always does.
dwtp48u,Kakarot_faps,"True but many of china's factories would essentially collapse without our consumption. It's not as if they can sell to other countries to make up the loss. Meanwhile the USA can buy from one of the many other developing countries or even produce much of it ourselves (we have the factories) just at a higher price.

dwsu7k1,ForgetTheRuralJuror,"We hardly manufacture our own computer chips. Although a good deal of chips are made by US companies, a large amount are actually *manufactured* outside the US.Also most of our steel comes from Canada & china by more than double.Also most of our skilled work comes from first generation immigrants.*Edit - Got my original numbers from a Vietnamese propaganda website apparently."
dwsvkw8,HEV_tux,"Nope. Outsourcing is done here and there but microprocessors have almost always been a US mainland thing. Intel for example has 9 plants in the USA, 1 in Ireland, 1 in Israel, and 1 in China. Those locations aren't for outsourcing costs but for the benefit of providing for customers in those regions. I'm not sure why you would say vietnam, Kore and Japan are the biggest outsource locations for Microchips. I didn't say steel as a whole, as said *high end* steel. Cheaper things are easier to mass produce in China, high end supplies require specific factory setups and very specific skilled labor to produce en masse. It could be argued that Japan and Korea *can* make better steel, but not on the same scale that the USA can. Whether or not the skilled labor is an immigrant is irellevant, a citizen is a citizen. That said, in almost no industry is it even close to **most** of the skilled labor. Even in something like coding it's hardly 20% made up of immigrants, and almost all of those are from india, a trend that has been declining for half a decade."
dwt31ia,brianzdaniels,Thank you. The guy you are responding to has no idea what he is talking about.
dwsp3ba,carpenterio,Tourism? Yeah not that...skilled labour ? Not that either...university? For the cost of it it better be and I am not even sure your university are doing so well anymore. Cultural export is pretty much only films and tv show( some very good one!). I don't bash the US but there isn't much goods compare to China or Europe.
dwss4c2,HEV_tux,"the Top 4 universities are in the usa, 6 of the top ten, and 60 of the top 100. Students and Professors come from around the world to be involved with the ivy league and southern ivy schools. No other country on earth comes close. The cost is proportionate to their demand, and yes they are still doing remarkably well, some such as Duke, Harvard, USF, UNC, and Yale are doing better than ever. Skilled labour is what's known as service jobs. While the USA does have a ton of stupid people (like anywhere on earth), they also have a remarkably high amount of people with not only the education (due to the presence of good Universities) but also people with consistent experience in those areas. By % of skileld labor to population USA is only behind some of the more prominent Scandanavian and central Euro nations (Germany and france mainly) which have far smaller populations and benefit from US partnerships. In tourism USA is only second to France, which is almost entirely due to Paris. People from the world over cross oceans on doors and enter sex slavery just to be able to set foot in he USA. There is a reason for that.You should research things before you join in to these ""omg america sux now"" reddit circlejerks."

dwsugme,HEV_tux,"No, according to almost all measurements including ones based in countries that don't care for the US."
dwsvv7b,thatscool22,"Skilled labor will be out of jobs if the markets crash. And you're lumping in fast food and retail as skilled? It isn't. Skilled are carpenters and welders and auto mechanics, etc. carpenters won't be working if no one is buying houses. Welders can't weld if there's no steel to weld. And people won't be able to afford to get their cars fixed if they don't have jobs.America really isn't that high up on most lists. I'm not a reddit circle jerk hating American. I'm a patriot but a realist more. Europe has free tuition for universities! Only foreigners who come to America to go university are the super rich ones. Most of them go home afterwords. Tourism will drop if China sees us as an enemy. China has been responsible for a lot of touristing the last few years. Europeans aren't going to come here when the national parks are going to be trashed by oil companies and cities are going to be full of crime from the urban poor getting poorer.We lead the first world in number of people jailed so at least that will stay the same. *high five Murica!*"
dwsxa3y,HEV_tux,"At what point did I imply that Fast food and retail were skilled labor? Carpenters do more than build houses, and skilled labor is *way* more broad than carpenters. At this day and age carpenters is probably the last thing that would come to my mind when I think skilled labor. Service positions count as skilled labor. Not all European universities are tuition free, and not for all students. China already sees the US as an enemy to a certain degree though that's a broad statement. It's not going to stop people from wanting to go to the US or vice versa. And actually no, most students *and* professors who move from China to American universities desperately want to stay and in many cases do. That's actually a serious issue going on right now so your comment indicates to me that you haven't a clue what you speak of. Most tourism to the USA is for cities like NY, not national parks, that said nothing indicates that oil companies are going to be tearing up national parks. Your bleak outlook of everything is so disconnected from reality, this is what happens when you spend all your time in these sites. Go outside."

dwseod7,strapboi,I was born and raised in Marathon Country Wisconsin. We are world renowned for our ginseng. Even so that my Chinese teacher in highschool said she was so excited when she found out she was being sent to the Wausau area because everyone in China knows that's where the best ginseng comes from. Most of Marathon County is on the poor side. These tariffs on ginseng will definitely be felt.

dwshz2d,Cleffable,Hey that's where I live
dwsr4fz,wngmv,I am from China and I have no idea of your region or the fact that there are ginseng in Wisconsin.
dwta0zi,metabug,"Look it up, it's pretty well known. American ginseng is translated as [花旗参](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8A%B1%E6%97%97%E5%8F%82) or 西洋参, not 人参, maybe that's why you don't know?"
dwtjr2t,wngmv,"I know what ginseng is.I'm telling you there are over 1 billion people in China. the chance all of them know some obscure town in Wisconsin produces quality ginseng is very low, despite of what some people claim."
dwtkyve,metabug,"I can understand you've not heard of Marathon county or Wausau city, but how could you know what 花旗参 is without knowing 威斯康辛州? They are almost always advertised in the same breath because Wisconsin is not only the main source of production for 花旗参, but also known to produce the highest quality, sold at much higher price than the stuff from Canada or China. Also, when people say ""everyone"", they don't literally mean everyone. I'm Chinese too and I think it's pretty common knowledge to any Chinese who's interested in buying 花旗参 as gift to bring back when are visiting the states."
dwtlt17,wngmv,"花旗参 as my understanding is any ginseng produced in the US. 花旗 is basically ""star spangled banner"". I'd wager 10% of the Chinese population know what the heck is Wisconsin. Less than 1% can point it out on a map. And yet almost everyone would know what is 花旗参"
dwtmlnu,metabug,"It's not just regular ginseng that happens to be made in US. It's a type of ginseng that's native to North America. Like I said it's produced in Canada and China as well. It looks different than Chinese ginseng and in Chinese medicine I don't think they are used the same way either. I think OP was just saying Wisconsin is synonymous to American ginseng (to Chinese who have heard about American ginseng and know the difference, I'm sure there's a lot of Chinese don't know there's ginseng in America or have only heard about it, so of course they wouldn't know), which I think is fair considering 95% of American ginseng is made in Wisconsin."
dwu6ttn,wngmv,"op said ""everyone in China know about that region"". I said no. whatever you said is irrelevant. I honestly don't care about that stuff, cuz I don't believe in folk medicine but whatever floats your boat."

Unless you are a second gen that lived in US/other countries for a long time you could not possibly not have at least seen this in any markets or heard it mentioned by ur babbling relatives. Chances are you might have even seen it but it isn't labeled as literally ""Ginseng"" since that's not its Chinese name(人参 )"

dwsjbqc,SpeedrunNoSpeedrun,"Well, the US position has been that free trade is preferable. This is an attempt to push back on a trade imbalance. My understanding is that China has been gaming the system and imposing tarrifs and restrictions and not allowing free trade. The real problem is that this was allowed in the first place. So as far as I can tell if China were to be willing to open up trade and let it balance out then US would reciprocate. US steel has been decimated already by China flooding the market with subsidized steel while kmposing tarrifs in incoming steel. Other industries as well. So the answer to your question is most certainly it does hurt, but we've been the target of unbalanced trade for decades and this is what happens when something is done about it. It'd be nice if we open up completely free trade with some countries to offset the Imbalance while dealing with China. India for instance has just as many people and is friendly politically. Japan is an option too."
dwso0ov,Andy_Schlafly,"India has even higher tariff barriers than China, and until quite recently, was a highly closed economy. Narendra Modi is trying to do some reforms, but he wont go as far as to open up India, lest he tread on Tata Industry toes, or somehow piss off the vast hordes of itererant hindu farmers."
dwsocco,SpeedrunNoSpeedrun,That's a good point. What is possible though is a new relationship developing to counter the moves made by each of the countries in a trade dispute. Point being that there are likely positives to be had on both sides in a more free trade agreement with India.

dwtbg5b,ShittehKitteh,"The aluminum tariff effects are already rearing their head in my industry. The price of aluminum boats is going up 8% for some of the brands I carry (normal yearly increase is between 0.5% and 2%) and customers that were looking to order have shied away due to the large price jump. A $50K rig from 2017 is now running $54K for an ordered boat with identical options when in a normal year the most the customer would pay would be a $1,000 increase for waiting to order the next model year. That maximum amount has literally quadrupled. I have received letters from the Presidents and Boards of Directors of the brands I carry urging their dealers to make their concerns known to Congress and to be direct with our customers about what is happening. They are going to pay more because an artificial control has been imposed on the free market. Keep in mind that the political affiliations of these Presidents and BoD's lean heavily to the right and their customers are mostly right leaning as well. These are Republicans letting their dealers and customers know that the tariffs will hurt them by driving up prices to higher than where the free market has already determined they should be."
dwtchn2,FblthpLives,"I'm not saying the effects are non-existent, just smaller than they would be with a 25% tariff.

The book was written in 2011, and while it sounded crazy back then, China's actions between then and now have been pretty consistent with the book's description (First few chapters sound whacky but read on and it will give some food for thought). I may not agree with tariffs, but I understand why he does it. Basically, if he does nothing USA will die, while if he does it and force China to the negotiating table, AND ACTUALLY GET A DEAL DONE TO ENSURE FAIR TRADE, USA may get hurt in the short term, but will survive and possibly prosper long term.

Trump just seems to me to be so full of his own hubris to be unable to recognize on any level the consequences of his actions, therefore he is not only dumb in the intellectual sense, but he is socially and morally immune to the effects his actions have on the world.It really is sad that such an idiot got put into a controlling position of one of the most powerful nations in the world, but there we have it.

Not to mention provide a lot of juicy news how everything is going to shit everywhere in the world and only in Mother Russia the Glorious Leader is making everything right.But you're literally portraying Putin as some kind of Spawn of Satan who's hell-bent on the destruction of the US of A. Not really. He wants certain things, none of which include total nuclear annihilation, poisoning our planet beyond repair or another global financial crisis. I'd go even further and assume he doesn't really give a damn about the state of US judicial system. Why would he?The 2008 affair has hit Russia pretty bloody hard. And partially it was responsible for the widespread protests of 2011-2013. It would be really stupid of him to intentionally promote that again. His main appeal and the only thing he campaigns on is ""stability"". Take that away and his throne wobbles. I realize it's discomforting... But it's not Russia who's pushing the trickle-down voodoo economics and corporate tax breaks. It's your own countrymen.Unfortunately I can't disagree with you about the asylum.

dwsjmtu,Slimer6,Florida may have gone blue anyway. They went blue for Clinton once and Obama twice.
dwsm68c,SovietBozo,"Uhhh, a few points...1) George Bush picked up votes in his second election. That means a non-trivial number of people who voted for Al Gore declined to vote for Kerry and switched to Bush instead. And this after Bush's first term which was pretty much a disaster. Trump will likely benefit from the same dynamic.2) When a party is in power for a full eight years, and people are ready for a change enough so that if there's a replacement from the other party, he also gets a full eight years. The one exception is Jimmy Carter (a poor campaigner, as Trump is not). Before that you have to go back to Grover Cleveland, and I'm not ever sure of that.3) Because of the above, *IF* the economy is doing decently, Trump will almost certainly be re-elected. Trumps *approval* rating is about 40%; virtually all those people will vote for Trump, and many people will be of the mind ""I don't approve of Trump at all, but I'm sure not going to vote for Kirsten Gillebrand"". On top of that you add any shenanigans, the fake-news stuff we saw in 2016, done even more cleverly. Sinclair controls the local news now, and a whole lot of people who don't watch Fox News or any news stuff do catch the 5:30 local news. There's no attempt to counter Russian influence, which by 2020 may very well include actual hacking of voting machines on a large scale. The electoral college favors Trump as we saw in 2016. The Koch Org and similar entities are rich and ruthless and have had that much more time to hone their technique. The Democrats don't have an obvious good candidate (Sanders and Warren are quite old and both have weaknesses) and will quite possibly select an uninspiring center-right Wall Street neo-liberal candidate like Kristen Gillibrand. Russian covert aid to Jill Stein will probably be even more extensive than in 2016. And so forth.So... as long as the economy is decent, I'd give 10-to-1 odds that Trump will win.Sorry.

Presidential Elections are different and people turn out for them.Hard working blue collar workers don't give a fuck who the president is, they care who can do more for them. Trump catered to them, whereas the Democrats catered to the inner city/poor. Whether it turned out that way or not doesn't matter to them either come next election, they don't care if it's a Democrat or a Republican, they care who is going to help them more in the end. Just as everyone should. If one campaign runs on promises to help them they'll vote for them. Hillary and the Democrats ran on helping immigrants, inner city, and insurance/bankers. None of which 'hard working blue collar' Americans care about."

dwssoyf,LincolnTransit,"**Warning**: Article has a dumb auto play video. Text, without an annoying autoplay video can be found below: China announced additional tariffs on 106 U.S. products on Wednesday, in a move likely to heighten global concerns of a tit-for-tat trade war between the world's biggest economies.The effective start date for the new charges was not announced, though China's Ministry of Commerce said the tariffs are designed to target up to $50 billion of U.S. products annually.The 25 percent levy on U.S. imports includes products such as soybeans, cars and whiskey, Beijing said. The full list can be found here.**Trade showdown**The move comes less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump unveiled a list of Chinese imports that he aims to target as part of a crackdown on what he deems as unfair trade practices. Sectors covered by Trump's proposed tariffs include products used for robotics, information technology, communication technology and aerospace.The trade showdown between Washington and Beijing has rattled investors and fueled market fears that the dispute could soon spiral into a full-blown trade war.When asked whether global markets were now officially observing an all-out trade war, Goldman Sachs' chief global equity strategist, Peter Oppenheimer, told CNBC: ""I think it is clearly a trade battle at the very least.""""I think the anxiety the market is reflecting is that it could escalate into a generalized (trade) war,"" he added.China's proposed countermeasures prompted U.S. stocks to plunge on Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average tanked more than 450 points, with Boeing and Caterpillar leading all stocks in the index lower.Meanwhile, Wednesday's announcement also prompted European stocks to extend losses, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 hitting a session low of 0.8 percent shortly after the news. ""I think Beijing is very keen to show that it is not going to be bullied, too,"" Neil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors, told CNBC on Wednesday.""(China) is going to position this as them responding to American aggression rather than necessarily being part of the problem,"" he added. The Chinese yuan also suffered its biggest daily fall against the dollar in two weeks after the measures were proposed. The currency slipped 0.4 percent to hit 6.3015 per dollar."
dwsf9bn,beeps-n-boops,"It's a sad but realistic assessment that, at this point in time, China would almost certainly win a trade war with the US (or just about any other country for that matter).Prediction: we (the US) will end up backing down while simultaneously spinning it in the press as a ""cooperative victory"" or some such nonsense."
dwsj8wi,Slimer6,"The US has far, far, far more leverage. If two countries are in a trade war, the one that receives more imports from the other has a significant advantage. Not saying that Trump won't be able to find a way to lose it or anything."
dwspw8j,Anon4comment,I think you severely underestimate China. They will use this trade war to kick start their domestic industries to produce exactly the high tech goods the US produces while making imports less competitive. China has never wanted to be the country that cheaply produces cheap crap forever. They wanted to get ahead sometime. This is their perfect opportunity.
dwsqnf2,zomb3h,Nah. They suck at customer support. Japan and Korea are waaaayyyyy better to deal with for high tech goods.
dwsu4u7,Anon4comment,"Maybe so. But I'm in Indonesia, which is a very pro-Japan country, and you should see the way Chinese tech is gaining popularity here. Everyone's buying Oppo, Vivo and Honor phones. Sure, Samsung and Sony and iphone are selling, but only to the upper middle class. That is dwarfed by the popularity of cheap Chinese goods among the new generation. Quite the same is happening in India. In fact, some of the really rich folk in India are abandoning apple in favour of buying an oppo and vivo every year. Still comes out cheaper.Wuling motors just launched in Indonesia and I've already seen plenty of their cars on the roads in Jakarta. Huawei and changhong are also gaining traction instead of LG. And sure, these are all cheap low-quality rip-offs of well-designed products made in other countries. It doesn't mean that China's not making a quick buck off this short-term sale and building an industrial base that's ready to compete with the west.When electric cars are launched in Indonesia, I absolutely expect the main competitors to be Japanese and Chinese companies, not any from Korea or western markets. And when you extrapolate that to the rest of South-East Asia, a market of 600 million people, you can see why I'm not sure that a trade war is going to stop China.The theft of intellectual property is absolutely a problem. I've been complaining about it for years. The way it is now, China is hardly ready to lead the world in innovation and tech. But that doesn't mean it couldn't be, and that's exactly the direction they seem headed in now. And if the disgraceful way they've been acting all these past few decades was the behaviour of the underdog, I shudder to think how terrible they're going to be as a superpower.They need to be stopped. Dead in their tracks. And they need to be held accountable for the crap they do, including shipping contaminated milk and honey across the world, demanding that foreign companies surrender intellectual property for the honour of doing business in China, and the absurd system of social credit they've decided to roll out across the nation. This trade war just isn't going to do it."
dwtd99a,zomb3h,"I'm just not optimistic of a future ruled by a Chinese superpower. They are they antithesis of free anything. Thought, innovation, technology."
dwssf9z,Rafaeliki,China can target constituencies to destroy support for the party in power who is waging the trade war. The US can't do the same since China only has one party.
dwstyu9,Slimer6,"You're absolutely right about that. That being said, what the communist party fears more than anything is not being able to deliver consistent growth. China is more of a shaky coalition than a lot of people realize, and the government has calculated that it can maintain power by ushering in prosperity. So far, so good. While China does have an angle that the United States doesn't—the ability to target sanctions and tariffs at a particular party—being able to threaten Chinese industry at all is effectively the same strategy. Like you said, it's just one party there."
dwsvu38,Rafaeliki,Xi is president for life. He doesn't have to worry about reelections. They have much more political leverage than Republicans who will be scared to lose their seat in a just 7 months. Generalized tariffs trying to hurt the entire Chinese economy will be far less effective than targeted tariffs that will unseat representatives.
dwsw6wx,Slimer6,"You're absolutely right. Xi does not have to worry about elections. I wasn't trying to imply that he did. The point I was trying to make is that the Chinese Communist Party has arrived at the conclusion that they can maintain power by making the economy grow at a predictable pace. The Chinese government has a well-founded fear that a recession could result in a revolution. For all I know, that's a revolt that they could crush if they really took the gloves off. I really have no idea what it would look like. I just know that they're scared of it. That's all I was trying to say. They do have skin in the game and are fearful that they have something to lose."

If those overseas bases are shut, America would loose key leverage for them to continue using American credit and American money in their economies, which would erode the purchasing power of America's currency in general. Imperial decline for the US would hurt a lot. (edit: That may not be an option for the US however - all the signs are pointing towards a retreating US empire. There's some good commentary on this, but basically the US is now kinda where the british empire was in 1923 - near the peak of its power, but greatly overextended, and facing global resistance to hegemony."
dwsn19l,-chipped-,next few decades should be very interesting to say the least.
dwsojnw,Andy_Schlafly,"There's a good book by noted historian ( who in a strange turn of events predicted the Soviet Union's collapse) Alfred McCoy called ""In the Shadows of the American Century - The Rise and Decline of US Global Power), where he explores current trends in the US, and the likely ramifications.

dws7qft,TheRealOneTwo,Thank you Mr Trump for making my dollar worth less. You ignorant prick
dws9b63,thijser2,For those wondering the US dollar has dropped approximately 10% in value since the start of his presidency.
dws9s1i,batsofburden,Really? That seems like a lot.
dws9wk3,thijser2,"In January 2017 the US had a index value of 103 compared to other currencies, this sits at 90 right now. That's actually a 12.6% decrease. [Source](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/currency)"
dws9z5v,batsofburden,"So is that a lot or does it just sound like it? I mean, does it have a big impact in some way or is this like a normal part of dollar value fluctuations?"
dwsaahx,thijser2,"It's a lot but the US dollar has had similar fluctuations in the past(the link should have historic data going back to the late 60s for comparison). A low value dollar means that foreign investors are leaving the US and/or that the US isn't exporting enough or that the markets expect either of those things to happen in the near future. What it means for you personally is that on average importing anything from foreign markets becomes 10% more expensive (on top of any potential trade tariffs) which will result in the US importing less goods (which is bad for consumers). At the same time US workers will become cheaper which can result in the value of the US dollar slowly climbing back, this is basically it's own economic cycle. That said disaster really strikes if this cycle and the bust and boom cycle of the stock markets sync up as the combined stress of both of these factors can massively hurt the banks (few foreign investors+loss in stocks= unhappy banks) which can go into a full on recession.That's all of course a massive simplification but might help you can a handle on what it all means."
dwsajje,batsofburden,Thanks for the info.
dwsowbz,KarmaConnoisseur47,Good summary mate.
dwsvbil,PM-ME-YOUR-TUMMIES,"I remember the last time the US dollar fell in value a bunch, I'm a model builder in Australia and all my model builder friends bought so many model kits from America while the Aussie dollar was high against the American one. The people they were buying them from were mostly private sellers trying to sell off things that they didnt need in order to afford food."
dwsabnb,csiz,"It's a lot, by comparison Brexit caused the GBP to fall by about 14%. Fairly clear by now that Brexit wasn't a smart choice."
dwsiuw7,ClearlyBanned22,A moderately lower currency value is good if you have an export and production problem at home.Theres a reason the world gripes about China keeping it's currency artificially low.
dwsodz4,Nuranon,"Yes but the benefit is still net negative if you have a trade deficit with the world like the US has, unlike China or Germany for example."
dwsv8xy,ClearlyBanned22,"It goes to reduce the deficit, that's the point.It's impossible to sell your goods when your cost is higher than everyone else in the world.Weak dollar means less importing of goods and higher demand for US made goods."
dwsw05g,Nuranon,"Sure, but the net effect is still negative which hurts consumers. I'm not saying this can't be positive (in some ways) but its a far less obvious as beneficial than with a country which has a trade surplus, especially when it happens as part of a trade dispute and potentially trade war."
dwteqzi,ClearlyBanned22,"Yes it's a net negative, but if the long term goals to get countries to recognize each others IP then the net result is a positive because it will legitimately open the China market.Right now economic policies between the US and China are so stiffled because of the way the Chinese government treats foreign companies, not just American ones. If the end result gets china to start to play nice with the rest of the world then it's good for everyone."
dwtf8wf,Nuranon,"We'll see who backs down first.But consider that China is doing the stuff they are doing because they think they can get away with it. And they might not be wrong...international economic policy is often might makes right and while China is pretty blatant about that, the US are not *super* different in that regard and for example are happy (trying to) apply US copyright law or weakening consumer protections in europe or internationally for example"
dwsoh8o,HappyLittleRadishes,"Because I know some redhat will inevitably counter with ""BUT OBAMA"", what was the history of the value of the USD with him in charge?"

dwsponk,HappyLittleRadishes,Thank you.
dwspint,ajt1296,"A high value of the USD isn't necessarily better or worse (within reason). If the value became too high too quickly, for example, he wouldn't be able to export jack squat"
dwspnte,HappyLittleRadishes,"Well yeah, but in this particular instance I can't really see how the dollar dropping in value under his presidency can either look or be good."
dwspv19,ajt1296,His whole MO is to increase American exports to lower trade deficits with other countries.
dwsq45e,HappyLittleRadishes,"I feel like that's just the spin put on the brash actions Donnie takes to ""get"" at other global players."
dwsuwzz,ajt1296,"I mean, weakening the dollar a bit is a legitimate economic strategy. That's how China got ahead, by artificially lowering the value of their currency to make exports and cost of production cheaper."
dwsvd0z,HappyLittleRadishes,"This may be a bad argument, but I would never accuse this administration of employing any sort of economic strategy. This is the same president that tried to bring Coal back."
dwsvw34,ajt1296,"You're right, it is a bad argument"
dwsw12v,HappyLittleRadishes,China also got ahead by heavily investing in their infrastructure and industrial growth. They didn't just weaken their currency and suddenly become and economic superpower.
dwswvqj,ajt1296,"Yeah, and?This is bad because Trump is a bad argument. Saying that it's not only X, but also a bit of Y is also not a strong argument. The fact is, a lot of U.S. companies and multinational corporations can benefit from the dollar losing value for a period (higher profit margins, pay more in taxes). If the dollar slide lasts another several years, that isn't great news. But for a president who is heavily focusing on increasing American exports and allowing US industry to thrive, it makes sense for the time being."
dwsh7u5,Bigglesworth95,Then it's time to get exporting
dwshg41,thijser2,"The US is best equipped to export services, high end finished products and agricultural products. With cuts being made to research and education services are struggling. Import tariffs on raw resources won't help with finished products and agricultural products are being put under pressure by foreign tariffs and lack of workers."
dwslbg7,Bigglesworth95,"I wasnt referring to any of that tho and I'm not sure i see the connection. I was saying that as the U.S. dollar drops, us goods are comparitively cheaper abroad, and thus they will sell better."
dwsr8bv,TheRealOneTwo,"But during a trade war, they will not due to tarrifs"
dwtpt0g,Bigglesworth95,Maybe. But I'm not here to defend tariffs
dwu5520,TheRealOneTwo,Then why are you even participating in a discussion thread about tariffs?
dwugusk,Bigglesworth95,Because I was responding to a particular comment about the usd dropping in value. Why are you responding to me if you don't know what I'm originally commenting on anyways?
dwsr1zm,zekufo,"Forgive my ignorance, but how does this effectively decrease our buying power if we purchase things in-country? Is it just the imports that will see price increases?"
dwsrb7m,thijser2,"The effect is strongest on goods that are imported, after that comes goods that use imported materials (half fabricates or raw resources) and goods produced in factories that use machines build in other countries.However if a product is made entirely within the US, raw resources included and all machines used to produce these goods are also produced within the US than it won't directly effect the purchasing power for these goods, however that's also exponentially rare."
dwt22nh,zekufo,Thank you!
dwsrfml,TheRealOneTwo,"What are you going to purchase in country? Milk? Okay. That person who makes the milk has to now pay more for the computers to run his farm, his tractors are going to be more expensive due to the increase costs in raw material and computers, all food he is buying will increase in price for similar reason, so he will have to raise his prices"

dwsndwm,AlanmanAaron,Wasn't that in line with predictions though?
dwsnq09,thijser2,"Depends on whose predictions, obviously the currency markets like the stock markets more or less follow what others predict they will do in the future. So some people predicted it would go down (and they could be quite a bit richer for it) and others predicted that the dollar would go up (and they may have lost a lot of money from that)."

dwsf5il,Alan982,That might explain why our manufacturing sector is insanely busy right now though.
dwsj4bq,ZillHS,Trump makes the Brexit Pound look good.
dwshc82,Gougeru,...That's because of unemployment going down and the FED raising interest rates. Don't act like this is solely the president's fault.
dwshyig,thijser2,"Of course, economic developments are always a combination of the political environment, the global economy and various social and economical developments within a country. Over time we know that with a trade defect the US dollar was going down and the reduction in unemployment since 2009 do indeed somewhat impact the situation. However trade wars are known to have huge negative impacts on currency value, same with loss of tourism both of which can be linked fairly directly to the president."
dwsi63o,Gougeru,"""reduction in unemployment since 2009 do indeed somewhat impact the situation.""No offense, but this kind of shows me that you don't really know how this all works. Unemployment hugely affects the strength of the dollar through expected interest/inflation rates. If unemployment goes down, people will expect inflation rates to go up, which weakens the dollar significantly.It doesn't just somewhat impact it, it's one of the biggest contributing factors, if not the biggest..."
dwsigvp,thijser2,"What I mean is that since 2009 unemployment has gone down significantly, however the US dollar has gone up in value in the same time frame due to various other factors, now the US is indeed approaching minimum unemployment and that does indeed make new investments hard, however we see a sharp bend around the time Trump policies began to come into effect where the dollar stopped gaining value (as it has been doing since 2011) and started losing value. However the speed by which unemployment has changed hasn't significantly changed over that time frame. This suggests that this situation is being driven by other factors."
dwshzm0,dropit_reborn,"I mean, this was the goal. It's not like no one saw *that* one coming. If you buy stuff from overseas (and we all do, at least indirectly), your dollar is worth less. But it also means that if you sell things overseas (and we all do, at least indirectly), then your product/service is worth more.What you should actually be concerned about is less trade surplus."
dwskz36,donutello2000,I thought economic performance in the first year of a presidency should really only be credited to the previous president. Or does that only apply to things that make the Republicans look good?
dwssiss,TheRealOneTwo,"I am referring to what is coming, not what happened. Although the performance of the dollar and the stock market in the last week are a direct result of Trump imposing tariffs."
dwsuko9,donutello2000,"That's a fair point. Presidents should be credited and blamed for economic consequences that can be tied to their actions (such as tax cuts or the imposition of tariffs). Many of the other replies to your comment focused on the drop in the value of the dollar since the beginning of 2017, however. That all being said, a weak dollar, while bad for consumers, is good for the long term economic health and competitiveness of the US."
dwsczwr,stevebigpantsjobs,Trump you ignorant slut
dwsfg20,In_shpurrs,"Interestingly, having a lower value currency can be positive for international business, as it becomes cheaper to buy with other currencies. And products from overseas become more expensive so citizens are almost forced to buy local goods. :)"
dwsfvj4,In_shpurrs,"So, essentially, what these retaliations are doing is “your weak currency is making it more expensive for your citizens to buy our products, so we will make it even more expensive for them.”:*"
dwss9e3,TheRealOneTwo,"Except those local goods also increase in price because the US relies on a global market. The cost of steel increases to the point where US steel is competitive again, except that industry's infrastructure is aged and not efficient. In order to compete better in the long term they need capital investments in technology which is now more expensive due to a trade war and those technologies not being produced in the US. They pass the costs on. What you stated is only true for an isolated economy, which we are no longer"
dwsunjt,In_shpurrs,"Depending on your plan. If you want to depend less on a global market create as much as possible locally, which is sure to create jobs. And if that doesn't work just lower wages. That's sure to work."
dwsxe9j,msc2179,isn't devaluing your currency a good thing. It makes your exports cheaper to sell abroad. Bad for US people wanting to travel or buy foreign good I guess.
dwt40kl,zachxyz,"Yes it increases exports. There is a lot more going on with the ""trade wars"" than people know or care to take into consideration. Interest rates are still incredibly low and need to be raised. Every time these interest rates are raised a new tariff story comes out."
dwse0pi,two-years-glop,I think that's intentional. A weak dollars helps US manufacturers (aka his base) and hurts consumers (aka you).Everything Trump did so far is out of pure partisal spite. He wants to punish blue states and liberal voters as much as he can get away with.
dwsrqhd,TheRealOneTwo,Tariffs hurt manufacturers.
dwsrkox,vahntitrio,"Yep, if local currency sales are static but those sales repatriot to more US dollars, then it looks like sales increased."
dwsknjj,xd366,"tbf, the aluminum tariff on China is a good thing. (not sure about whatever other thing were included in the tax)"
dwssfvc,TheRealOneTwo,"How is it good? In isolation sure, but guess what? They retaliate, then we retaliate, then they do. The end result is you are fucked. Of course the people who make bank during a trade war are those who have real estate holdings. Almost everyone else loses"
dwsesb6,penguindominance,"Actually, inflation is a indicator of growth and higher employment. While 12% is alot, american stocks are at an all time high. Inflation is in most cases not negative. Actually, it makes it better and safer for foreign investment, which america relies on.Hyper inflation is however very negative."
dwsrw35,TheRealOneTwo,What do you think is going to happen over the next year as our trading partners impose more and more tariffs? One of those partners happens to be the largest holder of US debt
dwt440b,zachxyz,"The Fed will raise interest rates back to 2008 levels if inflation increases. In fact, the US probably wants high inflation for now."
dwu53ez,TheRealOneTwo,"Yes, higher inflation would be a good thing. The problem with what he is doing is it's not in isolation. The economy is much more intertwined globally than it was 29 years ago. What he is risking us an interruption in the financial cycle and an early recession"

dwsx0jd,DapperDanManCan,"Yeah, you're a bit misinformed. UPS is not part of the USPS. Its a private company, just like FEDEX."
dwt1zmp,themolestedsliver,And how did i suggest it is? all i said was they were confused when that topic was brought up setting that bar low for me. I guess i could have been more direct but i dont see how you can misunderstand what i said.
dwtjfi4,DapperDanManCan,"It's the structure of your sentence that conveys a different meaning than what you've intended. Here's your quote:""But to be fair they were confused when someone said UPS was part of the united states postal service so the bar was quite low.""What that says to most readers, especially with what you've prefaced it with, is that your boss was (rightfully) confused when someone claimed UPS was a part of the USPS, while you, the narrator of this story, believe he was confused due to being wrong. Since UPS is in fact a private company, anyone in the know would rightfully be confused by an obviously false statement. While you didn't fully explain which side of the argument you believed was true, you used that example as a way to show that your boss was below average. The reader naturally infers that you agreed with the person claiming UPS was a part of the USPS, because the example given was pretty bad in the opposite context. Does that make sense? A better way to write it may be, ""But to be fair, they didn't know whether UPS was part of the USPS or not, so the bar was quite low."" It removes the guesswork on the reader as to what your position is."
dwtmiqb,themolestedsliver,"Do you really think you can grasp what I believe in either implications of my comment? whether you think i was talking about my boss when i meant the radio host (but was granted quite vague on the matter) i really don't see how you can justify saying i thought one way or the other. >While you didn't fully explain which side of the argument you believed was true, you used that example as a way to show that your boss was below average. The reader naturally infers that you agreed with the person claiming UPS was a part of the USPS, because the example given was pretty bad in the opposite context.But no, that is an assumption you are making because i used a very vague ""they"" to mean the radio hosts. I admit i could have been more clear but don't act like my vagueness gives you some sort of authority to declare one way or the other just based on how *you* perceived it. I don't think it is natural but i think i could have been a lot more concise. >Does that make sense? A better way to write it may be, ""But to be fair, they didn't know whether UPS was part of the USPS or not, so the bar was quite low."" It removes the guesswork on the reader as to what your position is.Yeah fair enough, a better way to have approached this from your angle would have been to ask me to clarify my position. I am glad we both took away something meaningful from this."
dwsv9l8,JakesBoolin,UPS is not part of the united states postal service genius. UPS is a private company USPS is a government agency.
dwt1ucl,themolestedsliver,"and how did i suggest otherwise? all i said was someone of them said UPS was part of the USPS,causing a confusion. maybe calm down with reactionary ""WRONG STUPID"" and actually pay attention to the words i am saying? Thank you."

dwtanbu,JakesBoolin,"You said, ""they were confused when someone said UPS was part of the united states postal service,"" which is not true so their confusion was justified. Then you asserted that they were the ones saying that by saying, ""all i said was someone of them said UPS was part of the USPS"" (and somehow at the same were confused by their own words).And the only, ""random claims and assertions"" I made was that the UPS is not part of the united states postal service, which is a fact.

I clarified they were confused by someone's words, meaning someone else on the broadcast IE one of the other hosts.

I think we're just lucky that some of those things were beneficial for others, too. We don't exist by ourselves on this planet.."
dwt38hm,LucyLilium92,The thing is... every action anyone ever does will always factor in how it benefits them
dwt7vjx,blurryfacedfugue,"I agree. I just think that too many people do not realize the benefits humanity if we also take into consideration the needs and wants of other countries. The Earth is getting no bigger, and our population isn't projected to decrease. While technology continues to improve, the resources we have is finite. We're all living in the same house and we need to learn how to get along. Yes, no one wants the basement and everyone wants the bigger rooms, but I'd rather share the house than risk it burn down or have to fight with treachery just so I can have a little more. Our neighbors are here to stay, and people remember how they're treated. Sure, we could just try to kill everybody that disagrees with us, but I don't think anyone has been successful in completely stamping something out. And once the oppressed feel like they've had enough, things start getting very very messy. All we have to do is open a history textbook and we know the different permutations that could happen."

dwtdb24,Slimer6,"Either that or Europe is. Or both of us. When two entities have a differing stance on where something stands, that isn't solely because one of the entities is messed up while the other one is perfect or something. Also, Obama wouldn't have been considered a conservative in Europe. A lot of not-very-Republican people try to make the point that the United States has two center-right parties, with one slightly more to the right of the other. That's not really the case. Clinton and Tony Blair were basically twins when it came to their political stances. Same goes for Obama and Merkel. Maybe the Democrats would be a slightly-less-liberal liberal party in Europe (“Europe” has a lot of political systems, by the way, and the ones where the Democrats wouldn't be considered as liberal as the liberal-est liberal parties is a small minority of nations, by the way), but they would fit right in."
dwtfyhl,blurryfacedfugue,"> When two entities have a differing stance on where something stands, that isn't solely because one of the entities is messed up while the other one is perfect or something. No, I agree with this point. However, it tells you where something is relative to something else. Further, wouldn't the fact that many Democrats and Republics are also neoconservatives also support these claims that the US, in comparison to Europe at least (though admittedly there are many gaps in my knowledge for Europe) are very conservative?"

Whilst I don't reside in either country, these tariffs will introduce a wave of protectionist tariffs across the world just so that international markets can continue.America is supposed to be a bastion of free market economics and capitalism. But no, they've lost the moral high ground by artificially altering their economy just to damage the Chinese. Well guess what - the reason that America is now the bad guy is that inflicting damage on the Chinese means inflicting damage on their own citizens. Some of the poorest too.It's like telling someone to stop punching themselves in the face.The people who pay for this aren't rich elites. They are the poor. Both poor Americans and Chinese suffer because of these trade tariffs, yet all the Trump homeboys come out in support because they simply see the alien country as a foreign evil.Not only is it ridiculous. It is sad. Children settle arguments better than Donald has."

And the ""free market"" can stay ""free"", within our own borders, where our workers and farmers have rights. If the poor have to pay extra for clothes and food in the short-term to ensure that they aren't racing to the bottom in the market, so be it."

If China had a trade deficit of $500B/year with the US, that would mean that China's annual imports from the US cost $500B more than China's annual exports to the US. I don't know why we should be upset about that. His statement would mean that the US was taking in a net of $500B/year in payments from China. He presumably intends to say that China is taking in a net of $500B/year in payments from the US.As usual, it is difficult to decide between his incompetence (mishearing advisors and talking points and ignoring the important details) and his manipulation (intentionally saying the wrong thing to put both the ""ineffective economy"" criticism and the net receiver of funds on the same foreign party)."

dwsrl7c,wellwasherelf,"> It's hardly panic if it's a full blown trade war. You think this will resolve quickly?Yes. A similar situation happened in 2002, and only took 8 months. It's going to be a lot faster this time too.Also, that is literally the worst advice to give someone. As an average Joe, no one should be pulling out of the market ""to buy back in a few weeks"". Unless you're planning on retiring in, like, a year, then there's not really much to worry about here.Just leave the shit where it is and don't touch it for 30 years or whatever. Unless you really, really, know what you're doing, don't do stupid shit like short-selling or day trading.Are you one of those people who was freaking out this morning when the market has dropped ~400 points, with no understanding of regular market fluctuations (its already gone up 250 points since then btw)?"
dwsskf8,Programmatically_Tea,"You might want to read the OP before you give bad advise.Hint: You also might want to read up on 2002. And stop pretending you know the future (""it's going to be a lot faster this time too"")."

But I am sure there are people reading this thread who have retirement portfolios and are legitimately scared for their future because of people like you doomsdaying. Legitimate question: Do you actually have an investment portfolio at all? Or are you just armchairing? You are telling people to treat their life savings as if they're at a casino.I'm not an expert in this field, and I'll fully admit it. Which is why I have a financial advisor to handle anything involving large sums of my money. What is your justification for telling people they should sell shares today and rebuy in a few weeks? What do you think they're going to gain out of that? By the by, as of right now, both NASDAQ and DOW are up from yesterday."
dwt47ph,Programmatically_Tea,> What is your justification for telling people they should sell shares today and rebuy in a few weeks?I did not. Maybe you ought to read what people write instead of giving financial advise based on your feelings.

Unless of course you think the market will be up in which case ""lol"".I read this just fine. Not sure what it is you want me to read otherwise? I'm not giving financial advice; I'm saying what *not* to do. Again, do you have an investment portfolio? Do you actually even live in the US? What do you think the average person has to gain by selling today and rebuying in a few weeks?As I said, I have a financial advisor myself, because I'm not an expert in the field. Where was I giving financial advice?By the way, it's spelled ""advice"", not ""advise""."
dwta726,ChartsNDarts,"Lol I was in a back in forth with that dude earlier. I think he's trolling to be honest.He'll make up things in his head that he thinks you said, even if you didn't.He'll say he didn't say things, even though they are written out and clearly visible for everyone to see.He can't come up with any argument. So he just repeats himself and tells everyone else they're stupid.But facts don't lie. He was advocating everyone to panic sell this morning, but the market ended positive. He has nothing to stand on besides his made up facts and insults. It's not worth the time really because no matter how obvious it is to the rest of us he was wrong, he will always be right in his head. I believe he's probably around 18 or 19 and has taken Macro Econ 101."

Should be easy, you went through my post history multiple times. Looking forward to it.If not you can always send more insults."
dwth1ie,ChartsNDarts,If you actually lived in reality you would see that you were the first one throwing insults around. Your very first comment to me told me to “shut the fuck up”. That's when I started not to care about insulting you because you really don't deserve any care.You must live on a different planet. But back to the original topic we were discussing.... How did panic selling work out for you this morning? Were you right or were you wrong? Can you answer that without going on a tangent and repeating yourself 10 times?
dwthlgo,Programmatically_Tea,"Repeating your strawmen doesn't make it any more valid. If it did it would have the ten times you tried earlier.I have to thank you though, since you make me laugh. You ""start not to care"" but you spend the time chasing me with 2 accounts, hurling insults and hours later repeat the same lies.It's really funny how angry I made you. And now you will repeat how I totally said what you feel I said and will get angry when I refuse to care about your feelings.But, unlike you (I would assume), I actually have a job that I need to do, so I really don't have time for you to repeat yourself 10 times how ""everybody"", and by that you mean yourself, totally disagrees with me about something that I haven't said."

dwtirce,Programmatically_Tea,"Well you are trying to push your feelings. What am I supposed to say?

I could ask you how your second language skills are, but I am pretty sure they are even worse than your knowledge of investing. That is to say, pretty terrible.Still would prefer that direct quote. But you not delivering and deflecting is just you admitting defeat. Good enough for me. Feel free to change my mind at any point by actually providng a quote that supports your claim."
dwtj63u,ChartsNDarts,Yeah I figured English wasn't your first language. Looks like your German.Maybe you should just stick to the DAX and let the big boys play in the real market. Because it just doesn't look like your 'feelings' translate into winning ideas (at least in this case).

Either way, putting you on a block list now. Don't feel free to make an account to message me in a few weeks. I really don't care about your feelings - as you know by now."
dws9whd,batsofburden,I don't understand the stock market at all.
dwsaf1j,sobrique,"It's both extremely easy and hideously complicated. The easy bit is - you buy a piece of a company. That company rewards you via dividends (sometimes) for the money you gave them. And if the company expands, the slice you bought expands too.That's really all there is to it. It gets complicated because the value of a company is actually pretty subjective. If there's a bad harvest coming, companies depending on that harvest might be expected to do worse this year, pay a lower dividend or not grow. The company itself is unchanged, but people want to sell their slice at a discount. Which makes the value look lower. A trade war does damage to a lot of companies at various points in the supply chain, so as a result their values fall. But the damage hasn't happened yet - this market move is therefore just speculation and confidence. Nothing ""real"" at all."
dwscw54,Cockalorum,"> It gets complicated because the value of a company is actually pretty subjectiveThe complicated bit being that the stock market price isn't based on the company's value, or even it's perceived value - it's based on it's perceived future value, which is why the stock market seems at times to be completely delusional"

Kind of an interesting string of events here where [Trump threatened](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-autos/chided-by-trump-ford-scraps-mexico-factory-adds-michigan-jobs-idUSKBN14N1T0) automakers not to produce cars in Mexico anymore.

Should the president just allow this to happen? At what point do we say enough?"
dwsuqc8,MadamNarrator,Continuing the course as is will fuck up our market and our economy.

dwtyxzy,MadamNarrator,"Sure! :DContinuing the course as is will fuck up our market and our economy. The current *situation* will not end in USA victory or with any sort of vengeance as you hope...China unfortunately has better cards than us at the moment and a proper solution will not come without proper thought and due diligence.Now if you would stop nitpicking words, we can have a proper, normal discussion between adults without needing to be condescending. Discussion doesnt mean this whole C-Span deal, but just casual talk.If you're not willing to come level with me, then I don't think it'd be proper to continue the conversation. The United States got to this point not only through blood shed sacrifice and vitrol but words exchanged by opposite ends and compromises. For the most part, we've done good, and I would hope both of us want a better America. Maybe the vision is different but that's why we converse. Best way to move forward is via compromise. I'm sure you'll be more likely to respond with more of the same tone, but this is worth a shot."
dwu5s60,FranklinAbernathy,"Why are you under the impression that the United States is under the thumb of China? We are the largest importer of their goods and being that China's economy is largely propped up by exports, we have more leverage. If the United States we're to impose major tariffs on Chinese goods their economy would take a major blow, which the reporting they issue on their economic growth is largely bullshit and this is known throughout the world.Secondly, China already has tarriffs as high as 30% on American imports. China isn't a large importer of American goods so we don't have much to lose if they add more tariffs to our goods. Them putting more tariffs on our goods was a symbolic stunt for the American media to try and pressure Trump to back down because they already hate him. You've already taken the bait considering you're already referring to this as a trade war.Any effects from us telling China to cut the bullshit of placing tariffs on American goods, which they already do so again their announcement of tariffs in kind was bullshit, will be short lived as we have major trade agreements with numerous nations more than happy to fill the void. Just so you know, the EU is pretty close to being as big an importer to the U.S. as China and we don't have nearly the same trade deficit with them. Mexico and Canada are a bigger importer to the US than China if you combine the two.Our economy isn't going to collapse if we tell China to go fuck themselves; we would just have to pay more for a short period until those voids were filled by other exporters. However, their economy would take a nose dive if we start imposing the same tariffs on their goods as they do our imports."
dx40gep,FranklinAbernathy,"Your opinion hasn't aged well and it only took 5 days...http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/04/10/chinas-president-promises-to-cut-auto-import-tariff-amid-tariff-tension-with-washington.amp.htmlYou still feeling so smart, smart guy? Hahahaha"
dx4j109,MadamNarrator,"I'm not a smart guy.I don't think I ever implied myself to be so. Heck, not even a guy, huehue. I'm very sorry for not replying to your earlier message though. I sometimes get swamped and a long message like that deserved a proper answer. I just didn't have the time. I still don't but you seem to be under this impression that I 'lost' or something. This is just a discussion.Anywho, my opinion seemed to be that the current trade situation would not end well because China has the better cards. This doesnt really change. They arent bowing to our interests. If they did, the easing on Auto import tarriff would have involved some of the other things that are important to us. We targeted end products that make their way to China. They targeted products that we need for our end products. If anything, something like the soybean would be better off being not being imported because it means the Chinese would be motivated to make their own, especially when it would now be cheaper to do so. It feels more like an indication that they aren't quite yet prepared for what the lack of US auto products would mean to China. The article sent did mention he's lowering restrictions for foreign car ownership which means US may not be the only beneficiary to this. Chinese cars are pretty shitastic...its better to drive foreign. It's fallen out of favor in recent years even in their place of origin.https://carbuzz.com/news/the-chinese-don-t-want-crappy-chinese-cars-eitherDespite the age of the article, they just haven't quite figured out the whole car thing yet. China benefits from better made cars. US cars are pretty dang good. Not the best, but good.Xi did mention he wanted to open up imports to China. This sounds good. China doesnt wanna hurt Trump as a businessman, only as a politician and the same goes for Trump to the Chinese. This would make it so that Trump has an easier out than most other men in his situation, but it doesnt mean diddlysquat until Trump backs off his tariffs. Xi only warned about Cold Era tensions. China still has the upper hand in a theoretical trade war so I would wait and see if he lowers tariffs on more US goods rather than sounding the trumpet at the first and frankly, only decreased tariff."

The average Scot (not Scott) can speak and write in English perfectly well but chooses not to.

dwsev2q,tek314159,"I'll just throw in that China has a lot of tools to fight a trade/economic war besides just tariffs. They're very good at moving their public and industry titans to attacking foreign goods. If this escalates, it will be seen as unpatriotic to buy US goods. Foreign sales of big ticket items will simply evaporate and go to German equivalents. Big corporations will cut down or cut off their big US real estate purchases and investments.

If they outlawed the purchase of US securities or, worst, a tax on holding US securities, they could bring the US economy to its knees in a matter of months. Having been through the double-digit interest rates of the early 1980s, and looking at our current debt, a rise of just 2-3% would either cripple the government or require a massive devaluation of the currency. China holding 6% of US debt may not sound like much, but if it all hit the market tomorrow it would be a rough road ahead."

dwsn70n,tritter211,"Bernie sanders and Donald Trump are populists in democrat and republican party respectively. Nearly every economist out there will tell you tariffs are bad. Why? Because if you win in one aspect, you lose in other aspect. Add it all, and you are basically at a net negative effect as a whole. For example, if certain american manufacturing is back thanks to the trade war, then US agricultural farmers and dairy farmers, and poultry farmers will lose. In this scenario, do you consider it as winning? Populists usually promise the moon to get votes. Just because bernie sanders is a democrat doesn't mean his policy positions are sound or rooted in reality. just like how Donald Trump is not building the wall, if bernie won the presidency, he probably isn't going to follow through with his insane promises. The structure of US government doesn't allow for that kind of promises to happen in short term. Tariffs sound good in paper, but the general population doesn't care about the complexities of trade deals that take into account the whole country. A coal miner is not going to give a shit about solar energy worker when given a chance.

SOMETHING has to be done. Is this the answer? I'm not going to armchair quarterback this thing because I'm not an expert. I just know that something does indeed need to be done. $336 billion dollars a year of loss is pretty freaking lopsided.
dwshyl5,MuddyFilter,A 336 billion dollar trade deficit is not the same thing as a 336 billion dollar loss.
dwspsud,Cleffer,"My mistake. That aside, it's not sustainable."
dwspun9,MuddyFilter,Why not?
dwsqw7k,Cleffer,"Once again, not an expert, but my understanding is that the Chinese economy is growing at a much faster pace than ours (creating the deficit) and by sustaining this, you're closing that gap and strengthening the economy of a country we have a somewhat tenuous relationship with."
dwsxvuo,JarJarDidNuffinWong,"Generally both countries benefit from trade, China just might be benefitting more proportionally. This is because trade allows both countries' markets to specialize in what they are good at. Otherwise US has to spend more resources to i.e. mining rare Earth elements or making steel, which US is not as good at as China. Or China has to spend more resources on universities, financial services, or pharma, which US is better at.Trade deficits are not bad either. You have a massive trade deficit with your grocery store, for instance. It's not a bad thing as long as you make more money than you spend there. You get to specialize in what you are good at (i.e. your job), the grocery store gets to specialize on what it is good at (i.e. providing food and everyday items).The example scales up. For example Australia has had a big net trade deficit for its entire history, and it has a very healthy economy. This is because countrywide, money is mainly created through other methods than trade. Money spent on buying foreign products is worth it if it allows your economy to be more efficient."
dwsxxuy,Cleffer,Good explainer. Thanks.
dwssohr,Federer2020hype,"Jesus this is so wrong. Deficit isn't a loss. The US benefits massively from this trade. By importing cheap Chinese goods people can build expensive high end goods and sell them to the rest of the world. Creating high quality jobs. If you want a trade surplus then start running sweat shops in the US. Few bucks a day making clothes, that will be great!Tariffs bring up the prices of goods. You've effectively made Americans poorer, now they have less to spend on other goods or invest. Companies see tariffs and flee. No one wins with tariffs. That's why year after year countries meet and remove tariffs.Then even a basic google search tells me China imports alot of soybeans from where? You guessed it. Places where people love Trump. Less demand for soybeans, less jobs in those areas. China will likely just import more from Australia. WINNING."
dwsl1nu,,[deleted]

dwsbibd,ZTLee,"""I'm guessing the Trump administration wants to get far more out of the Chinese than merely new understandings on steel, aluminum, intellectual property rights, and North Korea. The White House appears set to link a host of until-now unlinked issues. Issues like agriculture and freedom of navigation, manufacturing and the South China Sea, finance and hacking, market access and policies on Iran, reciprocity and Russian sanctions. It is a heavy list and even if the Chinese were to simply roll over on it all (which is not very likely) it would take quite a bit of time to work out the details. In my opinion, folks convinced of the Chinese rise aren't very good at math or reading maps. The Chinese financial system is the most overextended in history and every country that has followed its investment-led model has eventually crashed hard. The one-child policy has destroyed China's future – it is now the world's third-fastest aging demography. China's strategic position is horrid – a line of islands parallels its coast, preventing it from projecting power into the sea lanes upon which its economy depends. It is utterly reliant on global energy imports and global merchandise exports – imports and exports which are under the thumb of the U.S. Navy. The linkage the Americans are about to impose is the opposite of what the Chinese have become used to the Americans doing. It is precisely what the Chinese do to everyone else whenever the issue of Hong Kong or Taiwan or Tibet comes up. The Chinese are going to hate/fear this sort of strategic thinking in the United States because it cuts to the heart of the Chinese political system and strategic policy. And there's far more to this than Beijing knowing they lack the leverage on the Americans to win.

dwsizzv,CivilServiced,"A tariff is an additional tax. When goods from country A are subject to an import tariff in country B, it makes them more expensive overall in country B. This means less of that good will be purchased in country B if there are cheaper alternatives domestically or frm other countries.One market response is that prices of the good fall due to lower demand. Imagine you are a farmer and typically sell $2 million of soybean crops per year. Now you have the same amount of soybeans, but you will only be able to sell them for $1.25 million. People also invest in commodities futures, which is essentially betting on future values of those commodities. Those people are losing large quantities of value with sudden drops, just like drops in the stock market.Since tariffs can artificially raise the cost of imports, they can be used to encourage purchase of domestic goods, domestically and/or internationally (via more complex trade agreements). However, enacting tariffs is seen as a hostile action against a current trade partner, as shown above, and can be retaliated against in turn with tariffs on goods from the offending country. This is a trade war, economists overwhelmingly agree that trade wars are bad for all parties involved."
dwsjgs3,neontrotski,So these new product tariffs are basically making Americans pay more for these products since they are being imported from China. Right?
dwso2hf,noiwontpickaname,"Other way around. The Chinese tax it coming in to their country.So now we will not be making as much of the items because of an increased cost. Someone has to pay that cost so one of two things will happen, either they will pay us less for the product to offset the cost or they will buy less because it is too expensive. Either one is bad for the sellers."
dwsrpl5,CivilServiced,"Trump announced that he wanted to enact tariffs on Chinese imports, which would make those goods more expensive, yes (but also make similar goods produced domestically or from other countries more competitive).However this news is that China is enacting tariffs against US exports to China, which makes them more expensive there.

dwsp30d,emars,"I understand the legitimate merit in wanting to lower our trade deficit. However, I don't think people realize that this is not black and white issue. A trade deficit on its own is bad, but the implications of a trade deficit need to be considered.Do people realize that the trade deficits are a part of the paradigm of American dominance? We can buy a lot of cheap stuff from China and this helps consumers. Is the goal here to become China in this equation? Do we want to be the country that has cheap labor that foreign companies exploit to profit? Because that is what this recent push to increase manuacturing and impose tarrifs looks like to me."
dwsqe3c,Carp8DM,"There's a good investopedia article I read this morning about the beneifts and costs of a trade deficit.One thing that is important to recognize, as you point out, is that the USA is the largest economy in the world and our currency is the standard for the world as well...trade deficits in the long run for smaller countries is bad. But for the USA, historically for the past several decades, trade deficits haven't hurt us. Mainly because we are the world's super power.Now, if trump reduces us to less then a super power, then this trade deficit could be bad. But you're right, because we are a consumer economy, having cheap goods to buy is good overall for the USA.A trade deficit can be bad if we have nothing we make on our own. But of course, everyone knows that is not the case. Not to mention the fact that we still do have surpluses with other countries. It's not like we do not manufacture anything here in the USA.

dwt9fc1,ser_drake,From what people are saying we are producing more goods than there is a demand for.Sounds like now is the time to introduce a basic income derived from our nation's industrial surplus rather than expecting people to work without reason since that work will either be undervalued or wasted.
dwtbg0m,ed_merckx,"the tarrifs Trump has proposed take something like 6 months before they can actually go into effect, and for the ones he's proposed the EU, Canada and Mexico is exempt from the majority of it. I really think this is about bringing china to the table and get some agreement about them actually enforcing IP protection, anti-dumping and perhaps getting some concessions on foreign policy. The economy really is the place you can pressure china, as the government in power controls the media they are immune to pretty much everything, but one thing you can't lie to the people about is strength of your economy, eventually people take a look at their bank account and realize you're lying. And you can get away with significantly less shit when the economy is bad. So from a negotiations point of view I can kind of understand what Trump's doing, although he keeps rambling about the raw numbers of the trade deficit (never mind we have a very large surplus when it comes to exporting services) for some idiotic reason instead of pointing out the violations China does.He didn't even do a halfway decent job of explaining the steel/aluminum tarrifs which is one of the more black and white areas of china doing stuff that does hurt US and other domestic industry. Basiclly our output of these has continued to decrease (we are at something like 65% of production capacity, where as we were in the low 80%'s I think before the recession) while global demand has increased. The main reason is that during things like a recession or natural slumps in the commodities markets, US output naturally decreases. However when the economic cycle changes and demand/prices come back up to the point where we should have production increase it doesn't. Because during this time when we had to shut down production for economic reasons, china via massive government subsidies kept their output the same or even increased it. Not to mention we've got the added cost of putting production back on line. In the case of steel/aluminum specifically only something like 40,000 new jobs (I could be off on that number though) would come back if we get our production as a percentage of total capacity back to historical highs, meanwhile the industry has shaved off hundreds of thousands of jobs over the last decade. Telling me that a limited amount of those job losses are the direct result of dumping, and most are a result of efficiency increases in production methods, IE automation. Not that I agree with subsidies, but if Trump's end goal is just to bring back those 40k jobs that were lost because of dumping then just pushing a government subsidy would be a much less damaging way of doing so and he'd be much more effective in bringing these jobs back if he passes infrastructure spending and continuing to peel back inefficient regulations that do nothing except reduce our productivity, specifically in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. For the record though I don't think our infrastructure is in that bad shape when it comes to his rhetoric of ""it's all falling apart"", and you should worry when both parties use these buzzwords for cover of massive infrastructure bills funded by debt spending like Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc, etc all eventually propose. Because ""hey! it's our infrastructure, you're right we should always be fixing it"". Yes, there are areas that need spending directed, but overall it's not in that bad shape. Trump could easily show that with clear numbers, and pressure china. Or on things like theft of IP. instead he focuses on raw numbers like the total trade deficit. I hope his advisers are going to take this route and plan to use the mandatory wait time until the tariffs actually take place to negotiate and get concessions, it's what our government should do, and past administrations were complete pussies when it came to deal with china malfeasance on trade, shit even Europe took a very proactive approach to protect against inefficient trade practices in some areas. But the tarrifs are one area where trump alone, at the end of the day can cause some major damage. All this noise about Russia, ""how america sees us"" whether the presidency is respected by upper class people in new York, all that shit gets overblown to be the end of the world every day when it's really not that big of a thing, government is a massive machine that keeps churning. Yet the tariffs and trade is the one thing where trump can cause real damage and as a moderate republican that's what's worried me"
dwtd0nk,AhSoSpice-,"Good comment. I learned a lot. I work directly with farmers and I raise cattle so these tariffs impact a lot around me. It really has me worried, but if it is just a strategy to get to the table with them then I guess it could be good long term. I just hope Trump isn't the one making negotiations. Let someone a little less bull-headed do the negotiating. If this tariff sticks around it could really cripple the Ag sector. We already produce more soybeans than the US can use and if you take away a major export market we will be in a bad place."
dwtf4j2,AvalancheZ250,"We are all worried here. Lets hope these tariffs never go through. I can support a strongarm tactic to get people to the negotiating table so long as no one gets shot while trying to sit down. If a trade war actually happens, none of us get out of this better off."
dwty7md,endoftimenow,"Ahh if only it were so. Trump tried the bully tactic with Canada and the EU and it failed. Next, he tried it with China and it's failed gloriously.The Prairie Provinces have been developing soybean hybrids with a 116-day growth cycle and a 60 bushel corp yield per acre. Although limited to the southern part of Saskatchewan, Alberta it does mean there are a massive amount of acres that will be able to rotate soybeans over the next few years.With TPP there are no tariffs and no decentive in buying Cdn rather then American"
dww94v4,AhSoSpice-,"I had no idea soybeans were moving that far North. Go Canada. I've heard Canada is a lot more diverse that the corn belt. People in the area are pretty.... Boring, with crop rotation. Corn - soybean. That's about it."
dwtfvgo,Wormsblink,"Thank you for a more rational analysis.Unfortunately China will not be intimidated by the tarriff and allow the US to dictate their policies, especially since they have diversified their exports to include the EU and Africa. I fear there will be no positive consequences at all, but drastic damage to the US economy.One thing I should point out is that the US infrastructure is indeed falling apart. The American Society of Civil Engineers gives The USA a score of D+ for infrastructure, worse than some developing economies. I am a foreigner and have lived in the Bay Area in San Francisco for a year, which is considered a “wealthy” area. However the infrastructure I see needs major overhaul to bring it into the 21st century. Public transport is non-existent, public areas are dirty, power outages are common and the internet/telcos are terrible. I know these don't win votes but hopefully your politicians will spare some thought for the average person."
dwupqij,ed_merckx,"> American Society of Civil EngineersSo not to say that they don't have good analysis, but they are a trade group that represents Engineers, so they have a natural bias to push for spending bills that would give their members work. My point on infrastructure was less that we don't need new investment in things like public transportation (heavy rail around major metropolitan areas instead of stopgap measures like lane widening on highways for example) for new development, especially in the areas seeing massive population growth, but rather this idea that our current infrastructure is totally falling apart and is some ticking time bomb. It just feeds into this all or nothing political stratedgy that both sides practice, sell the panic and then put some massive spending bill when we maybe need half that, or in many cases much of the funds go to areas that don't need it. A big problem with some infrastructure development and/or repairs, especially in major cities, is unfortunately how large the bureaucracy is in these places. It's exponentially harder to get something built in the bay area than say Cleveland or Phoenix. Look at airports and transport run by the port authority in the Manhattan/NJ area. I used to live/work in the city and Newark airport is the same shithole it was 10 years ago, but any updates to it require so much bureaucratic oversight, appeasing dozens of different groups, environmental stuff, unions that have a vested interest in not changing things, horrible contracts that they are stuck in from 20 years ago, etc. Where as compare that to some of the cities in the Midwest and south that have seen massive new growth with large companies putting their new regional HQ's there, and they can do large infrastructure development in relatively fast times.The de-regulation especially at places like the department of the interior, department of transpiration, EPA, really is one area he should be getting way more credit for, but we are so hyper-politicized and media only wants to demonize and sell fear on everything. Remove a 20 year old environmental rule that studies have shown has done zero to reduce Co2 emissions and does nothing but add increased delays and costs to building a road, and the headlines read ""trump destroying environment by removing protections"". And I don't want to sound like some far-right conspiracy person, rather that people don't read beneath the surface of headlines very often, and give in to rampant speculation. In the US, politicians love to do things that make government bigger, even republicans. They talk about how much they want smaller government, how we aren't like all those ""socialist European countries"", blah blah. Yet they fund and support some of the largest socialized programs and bureaucracies in the world. And specifically in the last 20 years, D's and R's both found that it was easy to kind of sneak by increases to the federal government by expanding the federal agencies. So you can pass increased rules that might only benefit one large donor in say the construction industry, by requiring two more large environmental impact studies, even though the 5 you already have to do are more than enough, but by adding these two extra ones it pushes out a lot of competition when it comes to bidding for these contracts. I saw this firsthand in NYC with large development, and how many of these huge building companies support ultra restrictive land use and zoning laws, but the CEOs are very republican. Like you think to yourself, ""why would the CEO of a pipeline company support more environmental regulations""? Then you realize the regulations they lobby for have nothing to do with C02 emissions or actually protecting the environment, but just adding more layers of legal work you have to go through, which is nothing for a multi-billion dollar corporation, but for the small local builder with a staff of 20, no in house legal team, it's just another barrier to entry. To circle back to China, I think these will work in a way. China would feel much more impact from a ""Trade war"" than the US, at least in the sense of looking at the current state of their economy. The government is doing everything in their power to keep high gdp growth (its 6.7% now, and they want it higher), and taking on massive deficits to do so. They've already seen GDP fall from the 10%+ range which is natural, because economies can't stay in rapid expansion forever, and eventually settle back down to reasonable growth in the 3-5% range. While a squeeze to our economy might stagnate it, we are already planning on seeing large GDP growth from the de-regulation and tax cuts, and as someone who works in the investment industry, our fears of a trade war are more the worries of the effect on the stock market, and in terms of GDP worries that it might make some of the growth not as good as we were expecting. Read that as none of us see a $5 billion hit here or there from tarrifs as sending us into a recession, but rather maybe we see 4.12% gdp growth instead of 4.15% for 2019. Which isn't a good thing, but we still have a very positive outlook on the US economy. Where as when it comes to china, it's not that at all. Not to say we see china going into a recession or anything, but we don't see them getting back to double digit GDP growth anytime soon. Also when it comes to Trump, he seems to be the person that wants to just take any victory, even if it's way less than what he origionally wanted. Look at taxes, immigration, healthcare reform, etc. It all starts out as ""I want the biggest reform and change to the system we've ever seen"", $25 billion for a wall, and total overhaul of the current immigration system, and then he's willing to accept just a little extra funding for border security with no major changes to the current process. Or taxes, wanted corporate at 10-15% bare minimum and wouldn't go higher, but then settled on 22% corporate rate. If china came to him and gave him some minor concessions, appologized for companies stealing IP and promising to work harder to stop it, maybe agree to build one less artificial island or something, maybe it costs them a few billion over the next year or so, but in reality nothing changes, Trump would probably accept it. Because he can then go back and say ""look I got the greatest bestest deal of all time with china when no one else could""! when in realty nothing really changed."

Moreover, if the company in China is a US owned company (e.g. Apple), then most of the revenue ($2000) is gotten by the company, say $1800, then only $200 is given to China (Chinese workers in the company).4.

This would have decreased the deficit without any possibility of retaliation because the ball would be in Chinas court to be seen as going along with the process.Another would have been to not piss off every single market, and collude with EU, Canada, and other countries to show a united front and go through the WTO in a trade dispute to give Beijing less room to move so to speak.Both of these would have been ideal because they would give us a better backing and support. I am no fucking politician but I can see trump is a danger not only to the world, but to US in general. Very disheartening to see the staff around him not advising him. Esp. the minister of commerce/finance who recently resigned."
dwsfmgx,Forthesells,WTO is powerless. The US doesn't follow WTO and neither does China.
dwsftuj,TheodoreLinux,Oh my fuck please are you serious. Don't you realize the incumbent is on the nations in the dispute? The WTO GIVES trump the legitimacy and approval of supporting nations.Seriously fuck man learn to rules of the game. Did you purposely ask me for solutions only to know that you will just shitpost me regardless of my answer?
dwsg2l7,Forthesells,"Please explain why any country has to follow the directions of the WTO, when many countries have refused to do so previously? The WTO isn't some ruler that countries have to follow. China will never follow their instructions unless it wants to, and other countries would never go against China because they have become far too powerful and entrenched in every economy. Fuck man, they have control of our politics in Canada here. They have so much control it is truly scary."
dwsgado,TheodoreLinux,"Okay, a couple things I am going to say in a very slow and simple manner.1. You must reread my post. No one follows the WTO sure, but it gives them legitimacy to enact their own actions.2. China is extremely face conscious. Infact I believe this is one of their legitimate weaknesses. So chances are they would have likely dropped tariffs upon classification as a developed economy.3. You seem to not understand the WTO and the benefits from it as a whole. I implore you to read further to grasp the more obtuse intricacies.4. If you think the chinese are in control of our politics you are completely mad."
dwsguw2,Forthesells,"When you control the housing market and can make the entire economy crash, yes, you do own the politics in the country (Canada). You assume the WTO will accept the US's claim that China is no longer a developing country. I highly doubt they would rule in favour of the US."
dwsh2ax,TheodoreLinux,LOL yet again you show many things.1. They do not control the markets. Look at BC for example.2. The WTO DID accept the US's claim back in september which is why China is still classified as a emerging economy. LOOOOOOOL
dwshb55,Forthesells,Yes. Look at BC as the example. The amount of foreign owned property is staggering. Entire parts of the province are becoming homogeneously Chinese.
dwshk09,TheodoreLinux,Do you realize the tax they have put on foreign home buyers? THings take time. And also those homogenously chinese you are talking about are canadians first. We are a multicultural country fyi.
dwsida8,Forthesells,"That tax barely made a dent. It was to placate the Canadian people as if the government actually was doing something. The only way to stop it is to follow New Zealand. Cut foreign ownership until we have the housing market in check. Then, gradually open it back up. They aren't Canadians first because they aren't Canadian citizens."
dwsiuq1,TheodoreLinux,A lot of them are canadian citizens.
dwsj3c9,Forthesells,The majority of housing that is foreign owned is by non-citizens.
dwsg2hb,gt35r,"I know this is going to make your heads spin but Bernie Sanders actually said he would impose tariffs on China as well.

Please tell me how China would go about defeating the US military short of a full nuclear strike? They're only capable of utilizing area denial tactics in their own region and their borderline peasant soldiers haven't seen a lick of combat in years. Oh yea and the US has an Air Force of over 20,000 aircraft, that's 3x the size of the next largest. China the country that just now fielded its own aircraft carrier is going to beat a nation with 11 super carriers. You're fucking retarded."
dwsmvo3,nutmeggerking,"Why would China start a war? They are going to economically cripple us first. Build strong ties with Russia, Iran, the EU, and then wait for the U.S. to fall apart piece by piece. You think China is sitting around? We are leaving a vacuum in world leadership and China is filling it. While our infrastructure is deteriorating, China is building a new silk road across Eurasia, and subsidizing it for countries that it passes through. Those countries end up becoming economic allies. We levy taxes and tariffs on the EU and they are going to look elsewhere for more reliable trade partners. China is looking to expand their influence and power and we are playing right into it. They don't need 11 super carrirers. If the world economy ends up depending on China, then an attack on China is an attack on their partners/allies. Hence why it's fucking stupid for us to be starting trade wars on several fronts including thr EU and China."
dwsn413,TheButteredSloth,China might not have a choice if it continues to dredge islands for military use in international waters or make a push on Taiwan. You can't let thugs do what they want.
dwsnukf,nutmeggerking,"Oh that's really rich. Sorry, but they can exactly do that. Our invasion of Iraq made that entirely permissible. And that is what we call a consequence. We would have zero justification to intervene if China decided to put boots on the ground in Taiwan. They would manufacture some crises or justification to do it using the American playbook. Maybe we should think twice next time we decide to make up bullshit claims before invading another countries."

dwsldw3,Firgof,"""How can we lose against Russia? We have thousands more troops than them, more military power, and our technology and our command is greater in all respects. When we march to Russia, we march to victory!""Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it. China is fucking enormous, it is hill and tree country, lots and lots of marshland, and they have a *huge* population of people. You think Vietnam was bad, you ain't seen nothing if you want to try and take down China. Our navy (purely the navy, not the combined airforces that use the navy as staging areas/bases) can't even reach most of the country in force projection regarding their guns - which means it's going to be an air and ground war. As that goes, imagine the US Forces being asked to 'hold down and ensure victory' on literally the entire United States - because that's about what it'd be to ask them to take and hold China.The only thing China would need to do to win such a war is to shut down the flow of supplies and the military forces there would eat themselves. Supplies that must be shipped from overseas by plane or boat - supplies that come from nearly half the world away. Meanwhile, China has plenty of anti-air capability - and lots more if they conscript Japan into it who might feel obligated to do so if we're brazenly attacking China of all places.It's simply and flatly a bad idea. It would be an extremely god damn bloody war, our economy would be in tatters from overexertion, and our military forces would be strained to the breaking point fighting on such uneven terms. The last thing we should want to do is repeat the folly of Germany's stupidity in attempting to attack Russia.Meanwhile, while we're on an adventure in China that's costing us dearly, Russia's got the green light to do whatever the hell it wants because the US has already been forced to over-commit and over-extend to win a land war in china. One of the things Russia would obviously be doing, of course, would be to reinforce and supply China with their arms and economy - and if you think we can cut off not only the entire Chinese coastline but the entire border of China with our air force you've got a nasty realization coming."
dwsm4i0,TheButteredSloth,"I don't think you read a word I said. I said we wouldn't even have to step foot in that shit hole once their Air Force, navy, and bases in the South China Sea were wiped out."
dwsma2t,Firgof,How does that constitute us winning? Why would they need to surrender? You seem to think 'well if we kill their airforce and navy docks we've killed China'.
dwsmd3k,TheButteredSloth,How is that not winning? When you're encircled and trapped in your own country being blockaded by another country you're fucked.
dwsmhfy,Firgof,"How are they fucked? What? They have an enormous land border with other countries who may very well sympathize with and aid them.In addition, if they really wanted to, they have more than enough food production, textiles, metals, and oil to survive that blockade - not accounting for Russia being literally next door who'd be more than willing to help aid them in every regard. It wouldn't be *comfortable* for them, no, and their population might drop some - but the war'll take care of some of that anyway.You're not laying siege to a castle where you can just starve them to death. You're laying siege to a country that's nearly the size of the US and saying 'obviously we can keep no resources from getting in or out of this fucking huge country'. That's as ridiculous as us saying 'we will make sure that literally nobody can cross the US/Mexico border without proper paperwork' - and that border's both in-country and just a short little small and nearly entirely flat thing compared to trying to guard a foreign border in another country that's vastly larger and more difficult to guard in all respects. [This is what you literally think is something we can do when you say 'we can encircle and entrap that' because that red line I've drawn is what you'd need to not only protect but protect 24/7 at all times in every square mile of it -- this is what would be actually required if you want to ensure that *zero* resources get in or out of China and her neighbors](https://imgur.com/sKDusrV.png)e: [For context, this is what that area looks like when compared to the United States.](https://imgur.com/VRqIRbp.png)Do you think we win if Russia decides they have to defend China? Do you think we could win a war of blockades versus both Russia and China (and likely Japan and India)?"
dwsjz34,PM_ME_KNEE_SLAPPERS,It would probably start with a naval blockade that China could do nothing about. China is a net importer of food/energy so that wouldn't be good for them. The US wouldn't need to put a single boot on the ground to submit China. They would sink all their ships and destroy their ports leaving them with no way to trade goods for food.
dwsk6sl,TheButteredSloth,"Exactly this, China's navy and air force would be wiped out in a couple days / weeks and then all the US would have to do is strangle them economically with a blockade. Of course as always, nukes are still the great equalizer here. If they're crazy enough to use them, they're dead anyway when we retaliate."
dwsp3ve,mherr77m,"It's like people didn't learn from Vietnam. We'd lose because it'd be a war of attrition and we'd never have the stomach for it. Not to mention that Russia would join in with China, and possibly much of Latin America since they've been building ties there."
dwspdi2,Koty889,We would never win a land war in China. Or even a war eliminating their navy doesn't end them.
dwspfed,TheButteredSloth,Do any of you read? Didn't mention a land war once. And yes when you lose the ability to project any naval or air power you're thoroughly toast.
dwspelp,Koty889,You realize we're talking about China and not japan right. China has massive land borders.

China?They have near equivalent tech &amp;amp; weaponry, plus a standing army that is almost twice as large as ours (2.5 million vs. 1.3 million) and our active troop count is 500,000 vs. their 1.3 million and that's after they slashed troop surplus by millions meaning they could pump their numbers up in an instant, they also now hold more soft power over the world than we do.While America may have land & air superiority we lose that advantage considering we would have to take the fight to them giving them a significant advantage in terms of mobilization.A war with China is by no means an guaranteed victory for the US"
dwtaqfp,dylxesia,Are you actually that dumb? The US has by far the more superior military.
dwsl0zu,TheButteredSloth,"No we don't have to set foot on Chinese soil at all in fact. The US biggest challenge would be wiping out the Naval / Air base islands and air / sea defenses in the South China Sea. After the Chinese navy and air force are crushed, which they would be, they would just be blockaded."
dwsl9su,Mancaveaccount,"Yes, the Chinese will obviously just sit back, watch, allow that happen with zero resistance or retaliation. How foolish of me /s"
dwsm85j,TheButteredSloth,What are they gonna do when their navy is sunk at the bottom of the ocean and their Air Force In smoldering ruins? Paddle out to us?
dwsmpw5,Mancaveaccount,I forgot China was just going to let us sink their navy and smolder their Air Force. My bad LMAO I love how Reddit simultaneously thinks pro-2a gun nuts can easily overthrow the US government with rifles and handguns and claims the America military isn't shit because we got beat by rice farmers and camel jockeys once upon a time but when it's comes fighting the 2nd most powerful military on earth with the largest standing army on earth were just going to breeze right through them with zero problem.What a joke. You make be trolling because you can't possibly be this dumb.
dwsnc2a,TheButteredSloth,"It doesn't matter if they let us or not tittyboy. The US has the experience, superior tech, and can project that power better than anyone.

Maybe learn a little politics, dip shit."
dwsuf89,TheButteredSloth,Yea China the country that's broken international law and dredged military islands in the South China Sea and threatened to annex Taiwan isn't going to be the aggressor. You're a special kind of stupid.
dwsutkz,mikamitcha,"First off, hats off to your parents for doing an excellent job of teaching you manners. Secondly, you really think China is dumb enough to be the aggressor? They know NATO would step in, just because they bully their neighbors doesn't make them totally incompetent. They also know that, at least in the short run, they have the US by the balls economically."
dwsv6cy,TheButteredSloth,"The funny thing is they already were dumb enough to dredge those islands and violate international waters.

dwsdprm,tomandband,doesnt matter. china imports way more into America than America imports into china. This is still gonna be good for US economy
dwse3xs,lick_my_eye,How so?
dwsivn4,rdrptr,"We had a $375 billion trade deficiet with China in 2017. That means the Chinese exported $375 billion more into the US than we exported to China. As far as the numbers go, China has much, much more to lose in a trade war than we do.https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c5700.htmlWorse case scenario, consumer goods manufacturing comes back to the US at marginally higher prices, largely mitigated by advances in factory automation and relatively low capital financing. The factories and infrastructure are already here, they've just been abandoned & scaled down over the course of the past decade or two. Chinese manufacturing has been focusing on automation more lately, but they're still largely labor driven."
dwskmnh,OnABusInSTP,I have a massive trade deficit with my local grocery store. It accounts for a huge portion of my income. I buy from them and they never buy from me. It's terrible. Perhaps I ought to start growing my own food so I can lower my trade deficit.

dwst794,OnABusInSTP,You seem to have completely missed the point of this analogy. That's fine. I'm glad that you get utility out of gardening.
dwstmes,rdrptr,"I'm far from the only one.Your metaphor was full of holes anyway, you can just go to costco or walmart and load up, dude. The heck are you going to a grocery store for?"
dwstqjl,OnABusInSTP,...And then you have a trade deficit with Costco and Wal-mart. You haven't solved the problem.
dwsufej,rdrptr,Now here is where the metaphor really fails. I have no reciprocal trade with any store. Thats not what I go to a store for. That's not what anyone goes to a store for. I'm not worried about the macro implications of my lack of exports to walgreens. I sell labor to my employer and pay my bills.This is an apples and oranges comparison you've put together here.
dwt2pd5,OnABusInSTP,"Again, you seem to be missing the analogy so let me walk you through it. Your original comment mentioned the trade deficits as it was so awful thing. But trade deficits are not bad, they simply mean that so other country has more to sell to us than we have to sell to them. But notice, we are not ""losing"" in a situation in which we buy things, we are choosing the products we prefer at a given price point. The opportunity cost for China to make things like electronics is less than America's opportunity cost to make electronics. In other words, we have the labor power to make better stuff. China's opportunity cost to make soy beans is higher than America's. So we sell them soy beans. If we decide to put a extra tax on Chinese electronics all that will mean is we have to put an inefficient amount of labor toward electronics, and US consumers will have less electronics. This is basic economics. You probably learned this is high school."
dwt3xd1,rdrptr,"Funny how in your run down there you managed to forget a whole lot of basic economics.Firstly, China had high terriffs on US goods before Trump was ever in office. Cars, for example, were subject to a 100% import tax.Secondly, China subsidizes steel and aluminum production and dumps them in foriegn markets to eliminate competition.https://hbr.org/2008/06/subsidies-and-the-china-priceThirdly, China has been engaged in a policy of demanding Intellectual Property from foriegn companies that want to do business in the country.https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/opinion/china-us-intellectual-property-trump.htmlAll of these policies constitute illegal and/or non-reciprocal ill-faith actions, taken by China, to subvert the trade advantages of its competitor nations. We have plenty of stuff to sell to China, but they aren't playing fair. And all inadequately covered by your inferior grocery store example."
dwt5e91,OnABusInSTP,"I'll try explaining basic economics to you one last time. China is able to produce many consumer goods at a lower opportunity cost than the US. Why? Because China doesn't have the same level of technological sophistication as the US. The US is able to produce the same consumer goods as China (and even more efficiently than China), but that would mean our capital and labor are going toward production that is less valuable than it otherwise could have been. That's called an opportunity cost. Even though the United States has an absolute advantage in terms of productive efficiency for most goods over China, China has a comparative advantage in comparison to the US. This idea of opportunity cost holds true for most individuals. Farmers and grocery stores have a comparative advantage in providing people food over people providing their own food for themselves. Thus, you go to the store. It might be possible for everyone to grow their own food, but most people earn more doing something else with their time. As to the other things you said, we already have anti-dumping tariffs on China in regards to steel. In fact, China exports a small amount of steel to the United States. China does steal IP. Instead of starting an open-ended trade war, which is what Trump has done, we are better off requiring American companies to engage in protective IP practices if they do business in China. And we are better off coordinating anti-IP theft practices with the international community to maximize pressure on China. Unfortunately, that's the opposite of what Trump has done."
dwu3ugv,Brostradamnus,"I'm here to tell you your method of using this thing you call ""opportunity cost"" as approach to understanding the ramifications of trade policy is a weak argument. The loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen is the concept of opportunity cost. It's a thing that is impossible to accurately quantify as time stretches endlessly forward. Just because ball bearings are manufactured in China cheaper today than anywhere else at the moment does not mean it's inefficient or wrong to plan to make ball bearings in the USA or tax import into the USA. Ball mills are a field of study. Manufacturing engineering is a field of study. Labor costs are studied. Mining, Energy, Market projections... Hundreds of variables must be considered before you can accurately project ""Opportunity Cost"". Ever wonder why people say Economics is closer to Astrology than any hard science?"
dwt7inr,rdrptr,"You've failed to address my first point:> Firstly, China had high terriffs on US goods before Trump was ever in office. Cars, for example, were subject to a 100% import tax.This is perhaps the biggest factor in non-reciprocal ill-faith Chinese trade policy, which is perhaps the reason why you're trying to ignore it, because then you'd put yourself on the path of supporting Trumps position to persue reciprocal trade rather than let our country take a beating.China does not have a long or celebrated history of cooperation with foriegners on trade and intellectual property theft, so we need to leverage that $375 billion deficiet as much as possible if we want to see a response from them.You aren't counting for the transshipment of Chinese steelhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-eu-steel-china/eu-investigates-tariff-avoidance-by-chinese-steel-firms-idUSKBN1331RFhttps://agmetalminer.com/2016/11/16/eu-takes-action-against-transshipped-chinese-steel/"
dwt94pw,OnABusInSTP,"Since you didn't bother to source your first comment I didn't bother responding. For one, it seems to be a false claim. China's import taxes on cars ranges from 21-30%.Again, if we want to put pressure on China to drop its tariffs, then we ought to use to tools of internationalism and globalization to do it. China's import taxes on cars have been around since 2001, when the industry was relatively new to China (new industries are often allowed protection in their infancy so they can get off the ground.) We should work with our allies to sign multi-lateral trade deals that force them to bring down barriers. Once again, this is the opposite approach that Trump has taken. Instead of targeted actions to bring down trade barriers he first threaten all of our allies with tariffs (which, they thankfully rolled him on), and then lashed out with broad based action leading to a trade war. > China does not have a long or celebrated history of cooperationWhich is why you need to build a coalition to force China's hand. Threatening you allies, getting rolled, and then unilaterally starting a trade war is perhaps the dumbest route you could take to forcing China's hand on the issue."
dwta98x,rdrptr,"That was called the TPP, and it would have made our trade deficiet and IP issues even worse due to us being forced to make concessions on agreements other parties made in order to maintain cooperation with all parties. Trade by coalition is a fundamentally failed approach. Bilateral trade restores soveriegnty and negotiating power to countries ill-affected by trade imbalances."
dwtaz01,OnABusInSTP,"The TPP had the strongest intellectual property protections of any trade agreement that has existed since globalization. In fact, consumers in the US (especially on reddit) were mad that it gave companies too much power to enforce their IP claims. Saying the TPP would have made the IP issues worse is the height of ignorance. If we had a free trade zone with SE Asia that incorporated the IP protection enshrined in the TPP companies could easily choose to produce in other countries - i.e. not China - and force the Chinese to reform their IP practices. Throughout this conversation you have displayed quite a bit of ignorance of basic economics and an ability to say factually true things. This is probably the most egregious example."
dwtbolx,rdrptr,"It would have also been bad for labor, the environment, and as you correctly mentioned, intellectual property.

Trade by committee is horrible for world macroeconomic health. It is up to each state to negotiate deals that fit their own constituents needs, not a small subset of corporate lobbiests and bureaucrats.> Critics of the agreement point out that during the negotiations corporate lobbyists were consulted broadly but no significant consultations took place with consumer groups, taxpayer organizations, union organizations, healthcare professionals or environmentalists. Even elected representatives, were given only restricted access to the negotiating documents and then were not allowed to discuss them with anyone.

dwtqzip,OnABusInSTP,You have repeated the claim the claim that the TPP would have made IP protection worse several times now. That remains a factually inaccurate statement.

dwtwkjr,rdrptr,Your correction *was* convenient in that it was another argument against. TPP was too restrictive of IP. Further evidence of the failure of multilateral trade.

For years people have written about the threat China poses to the U.S., and the need to reset our relationship in terms of trade and other issues. Now Trump is finally doing something about it and everyone is mad at him?I wouldn't be surprised if many U.S. political and business elites secretly support what Trump is doing even if they are afraid to say so publicly. They can claim Trump's actions ""don't represent the U.S."" while in reality he is doing things that need to be done in order to maintain U.S. power."
dwsgpeo,Zeal514,"Yea, people just hate trump lol. I dont necessarily like trump and everything he stands for myself, but i dont shoot everything he does down instantly, and i deff dont believe everything from the left.People need to instead of instantly react to these moves, and try to understand the who what when where why, and really look at it as a game of chess. Than make decisions. Right now its just ""zomfg trump did a thing again were all doomed when do we get rid of this asshole derrr"" meanwhile they have no clue whats going on. Its the tax code changes all over again lol."
dwsh15s,magitciteWar,Yeah I'm sure it's just Trump hate and not the historical precedent surrounding tariffs from the 1920's. Remind us what great thing happened back then because of protectionism?
dwslq18,GyrokCarns,The recession in the 1920s had nothing to do with protectionism.You should call up whomever taught you history and berate them for the horrible job they did getting you to understand it.

dwsgijo,shayne1987,Obama and Bush Jr. Did quite a bit to fix that. Trump is reverting the world back to when China was exploiting everything and one.

Even though the US had “bad” trade deals, thus promoting Trump, was there stability in our market preventing a trade war?2. From those backing Trump's economic agenda, why does he feel the need to backtrack deals that have been in place to regain ground that has been passed over for years now? Why not evolve the US' position in the world-wide marketplace, instead of trying to bring back coal, factory jobs, fossil fuels, etc.?At the end of the day I don't really know what I'm talking about but he's starting to show his age, in that he doesn't seem too interested or passionate about new forms of industry and he only caters to those who love him.

dwsir0p,salesforcewarrior,"I imagine because China has had tariffs on our products for a long time, and we haven't had any on theirs. Also they steal designs from the US, and make a cheaper version of whatever product it is. This undercuts US suppliers, and floods the US market with Chinese knock off products. This goes for any industry in the US almost.That's my guess. Can't say if it was a good decision or not though."

I mean, when they were an ""emerging market"", fine, but they're literally number one by some metrics in manufacturing, economy, merch trade & holder of foreign exchange reserves?! I *think* they'll be ok if we level the playing field a bit. Probably gonna hurt a bit until US industry catches up, but as I understand it, the status quo was simply unsustainable indefinitely. We'd just be increasing our manufacturing dependence on them going forward. Better late than never."

dwslpix,nutmeggerking,"Yes, because they can't import food from somewhere else for a higher price. The alternative is to starve, right? Such a stupid argument you are trying to make."
dwsjyzp,OnABusInSTP,This isn't needed and it doesn't have to happen. It's entirely a result of Trump being impetuous. No one wins trade wars. Both sides are hurt and at some point both sides agree to lift sanctions. Trade goes back to largely the same levels as before. We have seen this movie play out over and over again.
dwt1j33,Obese_Child,"It's likely not going to be pleasant for either side, but China's bullshit needs to be called out before it's too late and they're fucking us beyond repair. China is the one in the wrong here and has been abusing us on trade for decades. I'm grateful we have a president who is willing to stand up to them for once instead of looking for a piece of the pie themselves while continuing to whore our country out. Just because it isn't going to be entirely pleasant doesn't inherently mean it's a bad thing to do. It needed to be done yesterday, but the sooner the better."
dwt1wk6,OnABusInSTP,"You have used a lot of buzzwords here, but have said very little. If China is engaging in untoward trade tactics then we should have targeted tariffs against them in order to correct their actions.That's not what happened here. This started when Trump said he was going to but a blanket tariff on all steel and aluminum imports (and then got rolled by the rest of the world, and pulled back.) The only country he left on the list is China, and now we are all going to suffer."
dwt45sh,Obese_Child,"lol, you called me out for using buzzwords and did the same thing. If you want to get into particulars, what “targeted tariffs” would you suggest that would “correct their actions?”Regardless of getting into specifics, the principle of my sentiment still stands: I'm glad we have a president looking out for the American worker and calling China out on their bullshit. It needs to happen now, not later."
dwt4btg,OnABusInSTP,What about the American workers that will lose their jobs as a result of Trump's impetuous trade actions? How is he looking out for them?
dwt86vt,TooBadForTheCows,"If anything, the way he did it is far more diplomatic than targeted tariffs would have been. The countries who they rolled back the tariffs for all presented their case for why that should happen. Assuming that they aren't willing to change their own unfair practices, what could China possibly say to justify such a rollback?"
dwtajgk,OnABusInSTP,"There was no diplomacy about it. We need to bring the full weight of the international economy against China. No one is going to partner with an unstable leader that lobs tariff threats at people at a whim. If we had brought the EU, Canada, South Korea, and Mexico with us issued joint and targeted tariffs against China they would be under maximum pressure to change their behavior. But we can't do that, because Trump is an unreliable ally and trading partner."
dwt7yh9,TooBadForTheCows,"Couldn't you argue that China started the ""trade war"" by ignoring our IP laws and enacting huge tariffs on imports from the U.S. many years before Trump even took office? How is this the U.S. starting a trade war? Why is your same comment not being used around the world to denounce China's practices?"
dwta7p7,OnABusInSTP,"China's trade practices are often terrible. I have very little positive to say about them. The escalation we are currently in is a result of Trump's impetuous trade moves over his term in office. It started when he threatened our allies (and China) with steel and aluminum tariffs. He got rolled by Europe, Canada and Mexico on steel and thankfully backed down, but it left us in a weak position. Instead of being able to approach China's anti-free trade practices with the backing of our allies, we are now going it alone. I have no problem trying to get China to open there economy. I think that's necessary, but it can't come by throwing a tantrum on Twitter. We need to be leaders on the global trade, and bring our allies with us to the table. When you start throwing tariff threats at everyone from twitter you lose your ability to lead."

The US meanwhile has to find new suppliers for all the stuff they import from China.......which is harder I imagine.That said what will happen in practice is that the costs will simply be passed onto the consumer........which in theory will hit the US consumer harder as they import cheaper goods of everyday use from China while US exports tend to be more technologically advanced (higher up the value chain) and wont directly feature in the consumption basket of the Chinese consumer.

dwsj5v1,Carp8DM,"First off, there was no trade war between the US and China untill now.Just because trump says there is no trade war because China already won the trade war (yes, he actually tweeted that) doesn't mean much of anything, really. A trade war involves tarrifs and direct taxes to the exporting company... China and the US have a deal which removes those tarrifs - untill now.Now, China does things like manipulate thier currency... And they also steal our intellectual property, and that must be addressed. But a trade war isn't the best way to do this.As for the trade deficit between the US and China, yeah. They sell us cheap goods that we buy more then we sell over there. But that does not mean we do not sell goods over there. By getting into this trade war, we're cutting off US goods to China, as we've seen now.By the way, historically speaking, trade deficits that the US has had with China been beneficial to US consumers and US companies.

dwsmaei,rickandmorty4ever100,Not sure about that. Pretty sure we need China to buy our products. China has a lot more internal an external customers besides the US. What you are saying may have been true 30 or 40 years ago but the world has changed.
dwsm8af,5e0295964d,Which is why the US has such a large trade deficit with China? That seems like the US needs Chinese goods more than China needs US goods.

Meat and produce from US/Canada.My shaving cream, which is oddly cheaper. Not sure if my gillette is completely made in the u.s.a but trust me I can afford another 5 dollars to purchase one. I have a couple of those towers you setup in the bathrooms for extra shelving.I also buy paper plates, eco friendly, that are made in the usa.If you are talking electronics, I buy premium equipment that tends to last for years so 100-200 extra bucks isn't a big deal.I think the problem here is that YOU don't have an understanding of the situation. You are still thinking Americans are mostly drowning in debt that involves massive monthly payments and are trying to 1 up their neighbor/raise kids they can't afford - we're all just dirt poor because we bought a house and car we can't afford and etc so we can't afford an extra 2 dollars and need to buy the cheap plates.That isn't the majority of the population anymore.

That's about an hour after he wakes up and takes his amphetamine pills. That's what's screwing up his brain and drying his mouth. Guy does not exercise and never has. Eats like shit and is over 70.

The only way is US has a DEFICIT which means buy more goods and give US dollar to other countries. US long purpose is to gain more goods and let the worldwide have to use US dollar. After that, US government can easily change the value of US dollar to let the other country losing the actual value of production by making more US dollar.I am surprised that many people don't even know if US dollar wants to be the worldwide currency, there must be a deficit."

dwsi4b1,JesterV,"I agree. Everyone has painted China is this big evil monster. Their economy is second place after ours! Ok. Go look up how small second place is compared to first place. China is a wealthy nation now mostly because we dumped all of our work on them. Apparently they make all of our stuff for a small percentage of what we would charge ourselves to make all our stuff. So if there is a trade war, won't it hurt the people who make the stuff the most? We really don't absolutely need plastic Walmart crap and slave labor clothing. Believe it or not there are many places in the world that still manufacture things, even the US, believe it or not.This reminds me of the huge panic everyone was in back in the 80s about Japan. There was the best selling book called ""Our Upcoming War with Japan."" American manufacturers were sending teams to Japan to analyze what the Japanese did that was so much better than what we do. They were going to take over the world! Notice how that all worked out.China needs us just as much as we need them, maybe more. Their president needs to appear tough at least as much as Trump does, maybe more. He's been strutting araround the world like a rooster talking smack about China's status in the world.

dwssanq,_TheConsumer_,"People on this thread are forgetting *why* the US enacted these tariffs in the first place. Our intellectual property is *invaluable*. A large portion of China's economy is built on stealing our IP. When an American company wants to do business with China, the American company needs to turn over all IP to the Chinese government for “inspection.” China then begins to mass manufacture the products and floods the market with cheap knock offs - that directly compete with our IP on the world stage. I wouldn't call this a trade war. I would call this economic protectionism. In the case of China, it is more than well justified. China unabashedly steals from us - while pretending to be our largest trading partner. This new approach balances the playing field and definitely hurts China more than it hurts us. You can measure our losses. You cannot measure China's when their stolen IP dries up."
dwssuwe,prof_red,So somebody forcing thoose us companies todo biz in china or what? Or are they apparently ok with giving away knowledge for a shitload of money? Since nobody forces you todo biz in china thats up to the companies to decide if they want to accept that deal or not.
dwsthb4,_TheConsumer_,"That's not what companies sign up for. They sign up for cheap labor. They do not sign up for a government stealing their tech and then directly competing with them. That's awful for our business - which invest millions (if not billions) in developing tech only to have China steal it and mass market it. We've known about this for about 20 years. No administration has taken them to task until now. China doesn't create anything. It steals. By drying up that well, we hurt them more than they hurt us."
dwsuupd,prof_red,"Ohh so fucking over chinese people and having them as slave labour tonproduce as cheap as fucking possible is good and dandy for american companies i see.. because they are forced again to manhfacture in china. No body force anyone todo any biz in china. If your a corrupt american company who only gives a shit about your profit and nothing else than that is your fucking choice to go to bed with whoever you want. Dont like it , dont do biz there. Simple. But no.. thats not the point, the point is to profit from china or anyone else while keeping them down.

They're friggin' #1 by some metrics in multiple global economic / trade categories at this point... *prooobably* ok to level the playing field a bit maybe? It's funny Xi announcing *new* tariffs like a little crying toddler throwing a fit when he's had 10x the import tariffs on us for decades which have helped his country to grow that much faster into an economic global powerhouse (not to mention the middle east free trade they're trying / tried to nab, plus all the standing Asian free trade agreements).

Yep. Yall might forget those people but I don't, and my downvotes are counting all of them that see this I suppose. The guilt has turned to anger and hate and that hate has become my downvotes"
dwtqt9q,stanleyfarnsworth,Your cognitive mistake is to count those Bernie voters as automatic HRC voters. Turns out they were Trump voters all along. My point stands. Run a stupid candidate (regardless of how much better she would CLEARLY have been as president) win stupid prizes. Still on you. You're shifting blame out of bitterness and anger. Understandable but misguided nevertheless.
dwufxrg,floatable_shark,"I profoundly disagree, and several analyses have shown this to be the case. For examplehttps://www.forbes.com/sites/omribenshahar/2016/11/17/the-non-voters-who-decided-the-election-trump-won-because-of-lower-democratic-turnout/#3931971153ab""Take Michigan for example. A state that Obama won in 2012 by 350,000 votes, Clinton lost by roughly 10,000. Why? She received 300,000 votes less than Obama did in 2012. Detroit and Wayne County should kick themselves because of the 595,253 votes they gave Obama in 2012, only 518,000 voted for Clinton in 2016. Mote than 75,000 Motown Obama voters did not bother to vote for Clinton! They did not become Trump voters – Trump received only 10,000 votes more than Romney did in this county. They simply stayed at home. If even a fraction of these lethargic Democrats had turned out to vote, Michigan would have stayed blue.""In my social media feeds at the time I recall seeing many sanders supportering liberals expressing their disillusion and saying they weren't going to vote. The data supports this. Democrats refusing to vote let Donald win, but they'll never admit responsibility just like trump voters won't admit they fucked up"
dwukypd,stanleyfarnsworth,Are you dense or willfully ignorant. You seem dense. It is the responsibility of the candidate to earn the vote. They are not entitled to it. HRC and the DNC were unable to earn the votes because they are weak candidates. Uninspiring. Corrupt? Maybe not illegally so but ethically so? Much stronger case for it. You're still wrong. Your mental/logical error is that you deserve X votes and if you didn't get them then it is the voters fault. Leaders take responsibility. They do not lay blame. The. End.
dwvwd4v,floatable_shark,"I'm not saying anyone deserved votes. Your error is in not recognizing that someone who abstains from voting is in fact casting a vote. They are voting that they don't care about the outcome. So the liberals who didn't vote for either candidate were using their voting power to say they don't care if Donald Trump is elected or if Hilary is elected.Granted, there's many Americans who never vote. They also share the blame for whoever is elected because they consistently don't care, or don't bother to educate themselves. But they have the same blame they always do, but the liberals who didn't vote because they wanted Bernie now share in that blame too, and they did it not because they're uneducated but because many of them were bitter. So yeah, job well done I say. Ask them about this and they'll probably deny it or try to justify it, as you are, because the burden of acknowledging you are in any way responsible for Donald Trump and the incredible damage he's caused to your great country is too much to bear. I get it. I would be saying this to my family that refused to vote but instead I'm saying it to you"
dwvwsjy,floatable_shark,"This ""they have to earn it"" mentality is a bit silly when you look at things from any sort of strategic perspective. Or game theory. Or trying to maximize your and your country's welfare. I tried to think of a comparison, like two friends voting what they want to do and the options are kill themselves or get ice cream and the one friend votes they kill themselves and the other abstains from voting because he doesn't really like ice cream.

No president wanted to deal with it because China always threatened trade war. Trump is saying ""fuck it, I'll be the president to do it"" and here we are. If China wanted the US to not impose tarrifs, they should have removed theirs and respected US patents and property ownership (all companies in China must be at least 50% owned by China).

If WW3 broke out, we would call in the reserves, anyone that had recently got out, and probably bring back the draft. We currently have almost a million in reserves, not including those who got out. Most military contracts are actually 8 year contracts with 4 active, 4 that you can be called back on. Some are 6/2. I'm not worried about personell numbers, our logistics and machinery out matches and out numbers the rest of the world by a huge margin.

dwsike6,Fuck_Me_If_Im_Wrong_,"Yeah, I guess you can consider every single citizen of NK a reserve or active lol. Still doesn't touch our logistics, tech, and equipment.It really is no contest. The US military has such a clear dominance on military technology, education, and capabilities it's not even funny.* [The US is responsible for 41% of global military expenditures.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures) That's right the US is responsible for almost half of the world's military expenditures.* [The US has the second largest active military in the world after China.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel) This is complemented by the US's air and naval forces. Speaking of which:* [The US has the most aircraft carriers in the world BY FAR at 10.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_carriers_in_service) Second place is Italy with 2. **The US has as many carriers in service as the rest of the world.** Think of each one as a mobile air force base. These are all Nimitz-class carriers, meaning they are a class of super-carriers that can hold about 90 planes each, travel at around 30 knots, and house 2 nuclear reactors for propulsion. **These motherfuckers can go over 20 years without refueling!** That means the US has 10 mobile air force bases that essentially never rests. The US is the undisputed Queen Bitch of the seas.And that's only the carriers. Globally, there are 28 Cruisers and 150 Destroyers. [The US owns 22 of those Cruisers and 62 of those Destroyers.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_level_of_military_equipment)* The US has the biggest air force, bar none. Technologically, the Russians have come out with an almost equivalent air fighter but the US has a much larger air force and the logistical capability to fight anywhere efficiently.* As if all these conventional weapons aren't enough, the US's nuclear capabilities are mind-boggling. Everyone knows the US and Russia generally have the same amount of nuclear weapons (around 5,000) but the US's delivery systems are unparalleled. The US holds 71 of 134 total nuclear powered submarines in the world. Out of these 71, 18 are Ohio-class. These are capable of holding 24 Trident SLBM missiles that each hold up to 8 MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle) nuclear warheads. Each of these MIRV warheads hold a firepower of 100 kilotons of TNT. **That means each of these subs could hold 24 missiles that can each separate into 8 nuclear warheads, totaling 192 warheads, each with a range of 4,600 miles. That means a sub off of NYC could hit Anchorage. You read that right. We essentially have 18 mobile nuclear launch bases that can move underwater.**Say there is knowledge of an impending nuclear attack by, say, North Korea. Suppose that US satellites saw North Koreans fueling the missiles and that they were going to launch a warhead. Before they were even done fueling, I am sure the US would have a few subs in the area and be capable of independently targeting each major city and military site in North Korea and nuking them. If they wanted to.TL:DR The US is Queen Bitch of the world. Militarily."
dwsja51,salesforcewarrior,"Not only this, but the US has drone swarms now. We've finally mimicked birds. Multiple drones swarming in for an attack is a scary thought.Plus the fact that the US knows what goes on around the world at all times is another factor. They even know what other military subs are doing. They use echolocation by whale sounds or something to determine where other military subs are.On one hand it irks me that we spend so much on the military, but on the other it's pretty damn impressive how much control we have over the world because of the military.

dwss795,FeatherArm,"While you may be joking, essentially...yes. Go look it up yourself how ISIS has been wiped out. It's not exactly breaking or new news."
dwsyaqu,LiarTruck,"Essentially. No. LolIraq has done most of the legwork there.What, specifically, do you think Trump has done to defeat Isis?"
dwszshb,FeatherArm,"Damn. You really let your hate for the guy cloud reality?The core change was Trump giving field commanders more decision-making authority which Mattis has said was incredibly important in accelerating ISIS' defeat. Not recklessly pulling out right now, even if they seem defeated is also the smart move.What exactly do YOU think Iraq has started doing that they weren't before? And why hasn't ANY publication said such? Even left-leaning new sources who I assume would MUCH RATHER give Iraq credit reluctantly admit ISIS is being beat down by Trump."
dwt97qd,ineyeseekay,Bullshit. Ramadi and Fallujah were already retaken before Trump tried to take credit. The momentum was well underway for the defeat of ISIS without Trump. The most Trump can be credited for is keeping his draft-evading hands off the operation and letting it continue on its successful path. He didn't do anything other than be in office when it could be said that ISIS was done with in Iraq.
dwt0z1u,LiarTruck,"I have no hate for Trump. I'm personally glad he's elected.Also:""Under Trump, the tempo of airstrikes increased, and military commanders were given greater leeway to order attacks. But Cordesman said that represented no great shift in overall strategy.""Trump deserves credit for fully implementing the plan and some limited improvements, but it is nonsense for him to take credit for a program his predecessor had largely put in place,"" he said.""http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/26/donald-trump/trump-takes-full-credit-gains-against-isis/"
dwt1es5,FeatherArm,"Ah yes, Politifact. The bastion of [unbiased reporting and truth](https://imgur.com/TtLRFof). It's true the **overall** strategy of ""contain and destroy"" has been unchanged, but to say ISIS being defeated is Obama's doing is so incredibly wrong."
dwt27bq,LiarTruck,"What about the article is wrong or biased?I don't view politifact as left leaning but you certainly do, right? I thought even the left leaning sites were giving Trump credit for the defeat of Isis?Edit: Another ""left leaning publication""http://www.newsweek.com/trump-isis-raqqa-isis-capital-687391"
dwt2sw0,FeatherArm,"It's absolutely left leaning. Take a look at the image I linked and how they bullshit their rating system on arbitrary points to make one side seem completely wrong even if only incorrect on a technicality or misunderstanding. They consistently favor the left on the same principles they dock the right for.As you'll notice though, Politifact DID give Trump a Half-True, SIMPLY because the ""experts"" they talked to didn't think he ""transformed"" Obama's strategy so much as adapted it. Which is bullshit and not at all relating to the premise of what the article is supposed to be about: ""We have done more in 8 years than the previous administration has done in many years against ISIS""."
dwt3dqr,LiarTruck,"But he hasn't done more. He just adopted Obama's strategy with less oversight That's actually doing less. Lmfao. For being ""left leaning"" a half true is awful gracious.It is nice to see you actually think Obama's done a good job, though. Or at least, a good enough job to try and give ""your guy"" credit for it.Are you also attributing Trump to our improved economy as well?"

dwshksw,,"When most people talk about the ""largest"" military they tend to mean ""most funded"", not largest as in ""the one with the most people in it"".If you assume ""largest"" means ""the one with the most money thrown into"" then the USA does have the ""largest"" military in the world, by a long shot, the USA spends about as much as the next 8 armed forces combined."
dwsicdj,957,"Well if we're looking solely at physical size, should we not have the mass of all of our weapons added to our size as well? Surely having more carriers than most of the world combined will give us the mass to overtake China by weight as well"

dwsxlxd,Fuck_Me_If_Im_Wrong_,"No military has been able to win those wars. Only way you can win it is through violence that has been outlawed. If we were to go toe-to-toe with another country, not an extremist group inside the country, we would win."
dwt2aq7,SpudsMcKensey,"Sorry man. Those goalposts are too far away for me now. Can i just fuck you and get it over with?The Vietnamese won, and unified their country.

They lost despite dropping 9 million tonnes of ordinance on not only Vietnam but surrounding countries as well, because hey, they look the same so they're probably Viet cong.They lost the Korean war, which I don't understand how you see that as unconventional.They created their own enemies in the middle East with their actions and failed policies, and continue to create their own enemy with heinous war crimes and illegal actions concerning treatment of POWs.So dude, just get this over with and let me fuck you."
dwt6v1v,Fuck_Me_If_Im_Wrong_,"Vietnam wasn't lost, it was a political war, we had won every major engagement. We fought it like it was a conventional war, which it wasnt. We didn't want to be held up in Vietnam for that long, had we gone in as a counter insurgency like they had tossed around, they figured the war would've been longer but definitely won. At the time we wanted to hop from communist nation to communist nation where there was a war to stop the spread of Russian influence.As for Korea, we had just come out of the worst war in human history, the US war war weary and we didn't lose, we just had a cease fire.TLDR: Counter insurgencies take a long time so no one wants to do them, you end up spending just as long fighting somethings that's hard to beat outright.

Your only answer to everything is ""we'll blow it up"", except out of the last 5 conflicts you've lost 4. What good is boasting about your mighty army if it accomplishes nothing. It's like a body builder that can't wipe its own ass. The fact is, you can't blow up poor education, poverty, violence rates, or social regression. Nobody respects the US anymore, why should they. Every opinion it holds is 50-80 years old. It's desperate to hold on to the good old times when might and wealth was all that mattered and it demonstrates time and time again it doesn't adapt. The only reason the US is still relevant, is because it has money. It purchased its allies. It won't take 100 years for the US to officially be a developing country, if it's not already. All the UN has to do is define universal health care as a must have for a developing country and the US drops off the list as the only currently developed country. And on this edge it chose a complete moron to take the helm. It's done."

Putting tariffs on Chinese goods will have less of an effect than than the Chinese putting tariffs on US goods.2. The US tariffs on Chinese goods are on materials that US businesses rely on to make their products. This means that stuff will get more expensive. The Chinese tariffs on US goods target markets that several industries rely on to prosper. Soy farmers will get hit hard.3. China has other trade partners that they can rely on to fill the gap, however, there are several Chinese goods that US businesses relied on for cheap materials and labor.Long story short, the US has nothing to gain from this trade war. Prices on Chinese goods will rise, certain industries will fall since trade with their main exporter is less profitable, and the stock market (and value of the US dollar) will drop."

Don't Tariffs just end up costing the consumer more?Do Chinese start buying Chinese Soy? Wouldn't that have been cheaper in the first place and something they would be doing anyway if they could?
dwsrsik,the_blind_gramber,"Your soy just became 25% more expensive in China. You would pass that along to the consumers.Now that American soy is more expensive, It's easier for Chinese soy farmers to compete with you by undercutting your new, higher, prices. Sauce manufacturers in China will probably start to locally source their raw ingredients and you have to find somewhere else to sell your stuff."
dwsuhzk,,Ok. But wouldn't with shipping and spoilage Chinese soy already be cheaper? I would think that a Chinese farmer is currently charging less than a Us Farmer for anything with or without tariffs.(Thank you for responding)
dwsv1ri,the_blind_gramber,"I know nothing about the soy market, that might all be true.But in any case, American soy just got 25% more expensive in China. Aggressive tariffs like this trend to hurt international suppliers and help domestic suppliers. Maybe Chinese soy was just a little bit cheaper and now it's a whole bunch cheaper, making it more attractive."
dwtb77c,,Me either. I was using soy as an example. I guess cars would work too. It just seems in my layman's (sp?) view that it would hurt the importer more than the exporter.
dwtcnm9,the_blind_gramber,"Exactly the opposite. Imagine if there was a tariff announced on, say, McDonald's. $5 per burger.Burger king doesn't get slapped with a tariff, so it keeps on going, no changes. Average meal at Burger king costs $4.50 same as always.McDonald's used to cost $4.00 per meal, and a lot of people ate there. Now, with the tariff, it costs $9.00 to eat there. So everybody eats at Burger king now instead. McDonald's goes out of business and Burger King flourishes. The tariff harmed the exporter (McDonald's) and helped the domestic supplier (Burger King) by artificially increasing the cost of doing business to the exporter."
dwtduqv,,"But this is taking a step back in the supply chain...and once again, wouldn't China already be buying all the soy from Chinese farmers first anyway? I have to imagine that if it's locally grown it's cheaper both in labor and transport. So if currently all the Soy they buy from the US is AFTER they maxed out the Chinese farmers would the cost burden be solely on Chinese consumers? TLDR: If you can not grow enough crops nationally to satisfy demand, wouldn't the cost of imports be passed on to the consumer?To use your BK and MickeyD's analogy: If BK was selling a happy meal for $4 and all of a sudden McD's cost $8, People would be forced to spend $8 once BK ran out of food.I'm not trying to argue, just failing to see the hole in my logic (which I'm sure exists)."
dwtfl5r,the_blind_gramber,"They likely aren't, just like Americans aren't buying up all the American cars before they start in on foreign cars. Especially if American soy is currently cheaper than Chinese soy. If in the extremely unlikely event all the soy China produces gets used, the next place they'll look might be India or Finland or somewhere else that doesn't have the tariff imposed.In the fast food analogy, if bk is running out of food, people will go to Jack in the box instead."

Ever wonder why you see all those iPhone rip-offs in China and not say Sweden or Canada? Because Sweden and Canada respect the US's intellectual property. China does not. China doesn't care. China will gladly steal the patents of how to make something, create it themselves, market it, and then sell it for a far cheaper price than say Apple. They can undercut Apple because they spent a fraction of the cost in R&D to make it, whereas Apple needs to impose a cost to their final product to recover their R&D efforts.This is not Trump's problem that he started it. He is the first president that is willing to do something. How do you think China's economy was able to take off so easily? By them making their own inventions? No, they simply stole and copied it from the US, and then rebranded it as Certified Chinese™ and then sold it to the billion people living over there.Of course they are going to retaliate, that was expected. But the cost of *not* doing anything is far worse, they will continue to steal and take advantage of the US's hard work, and something had to be done."

I'll look again if you can show me where in that report that is estimated. This is literally a report made to back up their policy of ""this is why immigrants are bad!"" When you look into the real life situation its much different. Get the immigrants into some neighborhoods that are down. For instance Hamtramck, Michigan. (Its what I know and why I keep going back to this state) Hamtramck was broke, talking about disbanding its police department to save money. Immigrants moved in, mostly Muslim, and started paying taxes. Opening up storefronts and bakeries. And Hamtramck actually carried a surplus while still maintaining city services. So much so, that hipsters are moving in and driving up housing prices. In 2008 a home in hamtramck could be had for as little as $3,000. Today those same homes are priced as high as $140,000.

dwsimpe,Auxilae,"> Literally, all companies would have to do to stop this supposed problem is to build stuff in the us.No, no that would not help much at all. Patents in the US are public, in order to patent something, you need to explain what you're trying to patent in full detail, and how it works. For example, [here](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8040326B2/en?assignee=Apple+Inc) is Apple's patent for the touchscreen of the original iPhone back in 2007. A Chinese company can come along, see what Apple did, and make their own. They are similar, though not exactly, like blueprints. It's more like an ingredient list. There is also corporate espionage, where insider information is stolen and then utilized for manufacturing purposes. [Chinese spies have been stealing corporate secrets](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/chinese-industrial-spies-cast-a-wider-net) for some time now.In the US, Apple is protected against other companies stealing their designs by looking at the patent and corporate espionage because they hold the ""rights"" to that patent for a certain amount of time. Only Apple, and companies Apple gives permission, can do what Apple did. Chinese companies don't have to follow US law, so they can steal that intellectual property, figure out how to manufacture it, and then sell it, all without the billions spent of that initial research that Apple had to do to get that patent.For your reference, [U.S. accuses China of stealing patents in WTO complaint](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-trade-wto/u-s-accuses-china-of-stealing-patents-in-wto-complaint-idUSKBN1GZ1BV?il=0)>“China appears to be breaking WTO rules by denying foreign patent holders, including U.S. companies, basic patent rights to stop a Chinese entity from using the technology after a licensing contract ends,” the U.S. Trade Representative's office said in a statement."
dwsl27t,mrnagrom,"Either way, do you honestly think china is going to stop breaking wto rules on patents because dipshit tariff's some goods? They make far more money off of their patent system for foreigners than they'll ever lose from the united states screwing its own people with a bunch of pointless tariffs.This is posturing for the maga crowd, not an attempt to regulate trade."
dwskm7t,Fearstruk,"For companies like Apple who have such a brand awareness, the cheap knock offs will never have a significant impact on their sales to the degree it would overshadow the savings they get by manufacturing in China. It isn't companies like Apple that are getting screwed. It's the medium size companies trying to launch themselves into the world market with a new product that China in turn steals to produce themselves. The reason China is getting away with this is because for the companies that don't care about cheap knock offs are still saving an epic fuck ton of money on manufacturing costs because of China's labor costs. Whether or not Trump's approach is correct, something still needs to be done to change things around."
dwtm793,mrnagrom,Oh i agree that something needs to be done. But this isn't going to be it. China is the second largest economy in the world and can pivot a lot faster than we can.

dwsf623,audioalt8,"Nah, Trump found any old reason because quite frankly - China sells more to the US than the US sells to China.He said it himself, it's all about the trade deficit. Trump doesn't give two shits about US intellectual property. All he cares about is starting a fight because China produces and the US consumes.Intellectual property theft is brought up all the time, but really it has minute economic effects compared to the simple fact that most American businesses make use of a cheaper, more efficient Chinese workforce.I don't live in either country. But it's clear to me, Trump is having a tantrum because he can't get the growth story that China can. Now he's pulling out ethical bollocks in a bid to explain escalating tensions across the pacific.Trump started it. Other politicians would have opted for diplomatically building relations with China to address the intellectual property issue. Trump has started to tear them down. He's all about tearing down bridges - and building walls."
dwsf9tw,blackProctologist,This isn't about IP that's just how Trump is selling it. He's been bitching about how the Chinese are ripping off Americans ever since he got fucked on the BoA deal. When he tried to call then out for currency manipulation everyone laughed at him. Now he's bitching about IP but in all honesty it's on the owners to assert their own property rights. I find it odd how conservatives are so against asserting US dominion when Obama wants to go into lybia or syria but when Trump wants to use it as a way to get back after being screwed on a deal conservatives jump right on board

dwskcau,blackProctologist,"Idk im not a foreign policy expert, but we'd have to give China something they want in return for getting something we want. This is the purpose of negotiations but Trump blew right past that and tried to start smacking them with a stick. That's not diplomacy and now we're going to pay for it. What's worst is that these tarriffs are targeted at the poorest and most vulnerable Americans. China is actively trying to influence domestic policy and Trump opened that door."
dwslucy,recon033,That still doesn't address what we should do about China stealing IP and manipulating currency. Sounds like you would rather let them continue to steal our secrets in the aviation/electronics/manufacturing industries and under cut the companies who create the ideas and build them here.
dwsm7hl,blackProctologist,We negotiate with them...
dwsmlo1,recon033,"Because the bush and Obama administration didn't try that? Obama filed the most grievances with the WTO while he was in office and we won most of them.

China has no interest in renegotiating something that benefits them."
dwso4o7,blackProctologist,"Compalining to the wto isn't negotiating, that's just another stick. Trump billed himself as this master negotiator and so far he hasnt demonstrated that.

dwsf1vp,FascistBot,Who enforces these patent laws? Did China agree to them or do we expect China to follow western ideals of property rights?
dwsg9si,Auxilae,"> Who enforces these patent laws?The [Patent Cooperation Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty) provided the framework for 'protecting' international patents. It does not offer enforcement, it is a treaty, similar to other treaties, it just means ""we'll respect you, if you respect us"".There isn't a one world government that can control who can actually make anything. If you're in Nowhere-stan and wanted to make and sell an iPhone in Nowhere-stan, then there isn't going to be police showing up to stop you. However, it is in the best interests for individual countries if the patents of their citizens are protected, this applies mostly for international brands like the iPhone. Except if you're China. Chinese companies will often look at the publicly-published patents, find out exactly how to build it from it, create a product that is eerily similar, use cheap labor (average factory worker's salary in China is $4,755) by exploiting workers in terrible working environments, then undercut the international competition who spent billions in research to build it. That is what has been going on.The gist is that if you make a patent for an international product, other countries will ""respect"" that, like a treaty (hence the words patent treaty). There is no enforcement, but countries have the ability to retaliate against repeat offenders, in this case, tariffs. Is it the *right* decision?, some economists say yes, others say no. I'm not here to tell you that it's a good or bad idea, you can figure that with your own research and opinion forming. I'm just here telling people that Trump did *not* start this. [China has been stealing intelectual property from the United States for decades are there has been next to no response](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/opinion/china-us-intellectual-property-trump.html) to it. Tariffs are one of the only options to handle such a repeat offender however. Denouncing doesn't really get you anywhere, you need actions.Edit- There is also the [Patent Law Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Law_Treaty), of which you'll notice China is not a member."
dwsk4pp,Fearstruk,"Can you copy and paste this all over this thread? As someone who's been working in Information Security for the last decade, China has been a consistent pain in my ass this entire time. I'm not saying that Trump's approach will be the correct one but at least he's doing something. Reddit just hates Trump so much and this entire thread is people scrambling to find a way where they don't have to admit he is actually right for once. In my field we tell anyone who wishes to do business with China that it isn't a matter of IF they get their hands on your confidential data/information it's a matter of when. Smaller companies will often look to China to manufacture their products only to find their EXACT product (albeit relabeled) pop up with a Chinese stamp before they even get their company off the ground. This is what's killed the US manufacturing industry."

dwucdfl,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"You're being disingenuous.You know what my point is:* The United States currently has a 25% tariff on imported trucks* GM, Ford, Fiat/Dodge, Honda, Toyota, and Nissan make a bazillion trucks in the United States because they're protected by tariffs* The United States currently has a 2.5% tariff on cars, and that's why we're all driving Hyundais and Hondas, not Ford and Chevy* China has a 25% tariff on imported cars, and that's why Buicks are built in China and exported to the USALook, I get it, John Oliver, CNN and MSNBC have their 'talking points' that tariffs are going to crash the economy. But they're being dishonest; everyone else already has tariffs. The reason I can buy a Honda Civic for $15K is because our tariff is 2.5% not 25%"
dwuj6by,audioalt8,"* No one is saying that tariffs don't exist.* No one is saying that existing tariffs aren't designed to try and protect certain industries. Evidently, plenty of Japanese auto makers thrive in the US.* What people are saying is that introducing tariffs as economic tools of war in a bid to hurt other nations is a *poor way of operating in a globalised economy.**Do you seriously think that China, or any other country will simply submit to economic threat by the US?* Of course not. These aren't tariffs designed carefully to enable certain industries. They are vindictive moves that would unlikely grow the American steel industry whatsoever.Trumps tariffs are designed to hurt China. So they've gone and hurt Americans back in terms of trade. It's a non-productive means of negotiation. Not only does it stall problems, it actually worsens geopolitical tension whilst impairing both economies. China isn't going to put its hands up on the IP issue unless it is worked out diplomatically. Especially not now, this is evident. Retaliatory tariffs just demonstrate the resentment that builds when you try to hurt others. They'll hurt Americans equivalently.There is one world leader rubbing his hands together at this fact. **Putin. Russia loves this.** American and Chinese business has lead to both countries being the most prosperous in living history. If Russia were to threaten America tomorrow, it wouldn't be in China's interest. Whilst all this posturing by Trump to a vital trade partner, in reality, the Chinese and American economy are intertwined.Violent economic protectionism makes the average American poorer, more unsafe and less able take advantage of a global economy. No, the economy will not crash. It wouldn't even crash if China disappeared off the planet tomorrow. But I think you would find it a much, much poorer world if that was the case."

This isn't a secret, but at least Zemin pretended to play by the rules.Xi has come along and the first thing he did was ""fight corruption"". The good thing that did was it removed Zemin from power, but it also was just a way of getting rid of all his political opponents. Removing your opponents is especially dangerous in a 1 party system because dissent is already uncommon to begin with. Then when you crown yourself President for life, people get scared.Many 中国人 I know believe that Xi cares too much about economic growth and is willing to sacrifice long-term outlooks to gain short term growth.The Bohai Strait project is a perfect example of him doing exactly that.There is a reason the meme of Winnie the Pooh eating honey with the caption ""find something you love and stick to it"" was circulating Weibo and WeChat. And it isn't because locals are rallying support.Not to mention, when Xi removed term limits I was not in my current home city of Shanghai, the city I was in had a number of protests. Of course they didn't last long and were broken up quickly."

Comparative advantage of the population by China: US 300 million, China 1.5 billion, it is natural the cost of labour-intensive products will be much cheaper when produced in China, this is a fact that cannot be changed, unless Rubio and Navarro call for more immigrants of their origin into the US2.

dwsuq8d,Z3brahed,"[The escalating skirmish between the USA and China over trade might just end up to President Trump's benefit, according to Dutch bank ING.](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-war-with-china-could-end-up-paying-off-ing-says-2018-4)I'm sorry, but a lot of people in this thread have absolutely no idea what they're talking about and it's honestly depressing to see people rooting for an authoritarian dictator state over the U.S. because their candidate didn't win the election."
dwswng0,aaronp1264,"also notice how highly upvoted the ""doom and gloom"" posts are... all the posts talking about the market tanking and ""take a shot for every 100 pts dropped""meanwhile, here we are. 3.5 hours into our trading day and only down 65 pts on the dow. i honestly doubt any one of these prognosticators know what time the market opens and closes."
dwswrj3,Z3brahed,"It's telling that we got bad news and the stock market isn't dropping. It may indicate that the bottom is in, which is a good thing. Jim Cramer always said you can tell a bottom is in when we get “bad” news, but the market doesn't fall anymore. Or when market is down huge @ open, but then rallys positive for the day. Seems a lot like today"
dwsyeq1,moonpotatoes,"I don't think anyone is ""rooting"" for China here. In fact, I think it's pretty well known that China's trade practices are pretty sketchy and not just with the US. With that being said, I think action needs to be taken but the problem is Trump's approach which does not fare well with Chinese culture, which is to always, no matter what, save face. This is not going to end well for anyone."
dwsym86,Z3brahed,"I scrolled the thread long enough to see people rooting for China because “elections have consequences”.And I think it's too early to tell if these tariffs are going to be good, bad, or disastrous in the long run. Too many variables. China hasn't even given the date for enacting these tariffs which may indicate they're more open to negotiation than you would believe."
dwsviyt,PartyFriend,At least China isn't threatening to strong-arm its allies into unfavourable trade deals.
dwsw41u,jesperbj,"For fucks sake, Trump, you stupid asshole."
dwsyd3b,IsaacClarkeSNL,"Completely removing politics from the equation **I think** this is good for the younger generation just getting into the work force. China has been progressively growing it's financial power over the US for the past decade at the very least and I think the US was going to need to react at some point. I am not saying if this is the right or wrong way to do it for the US, as I said i am looking at this from a economic perceptive. what we know now is that foreign stocks are performing really well compared to domestic US stocks lately. Over time tariffs may contribute to a better US economy when trade can balance more in the the favor of the US, though it will with certainty sting initially. This will hurt people close to retirement, obviously and that is a very real crisis.Most stocks on the market are currently very overvalued from my knowledge as well. We are probably reaching the tail end of a bull market, tariffs or not. This will let younger people get better returns in the decades down the road when the market balances more in the US favor **if the tariffs correct trade imbalances**. The tariffs need not be permanent.Overall I don't think this is really *all* doom and gloom, I think it could have a silver lining. It probably isn't the best way to go about it."

dwsqm64,PartyFriend,China has other options besides tariffs though and without Chinese exports things get very expensive for a while.
dwsg3cd,but_muh_feels,China is pretty retarded if they think they can win a trade war given the size of the US/China trade imbalance. The US can hurt them far more than they can the US.

dwshr0b,Theinsulated,They'll deal with our high food prices by buying their food elsewhere. American farmers will suffer dearly for this. The price of corn and soy is already dropping.
dwshttx,meteorprime,The best trade deals people.Maybe we should send our SOS over there to try and smooth things over?
dwsj1r5,PhreakOfTime,It's not like they can just buy soybeans from Brazil.Almost half of the soybeans grown in the midwest are exported to China. This pretty much screws farmers.
dwwcufv,WhatEverOkFine,"No, it doesn't ""screw"" farmers, it makes it less financially productive to exclusively grow soybean and ship it to china... see also: soybean monoculture and the problems associated with it: https://www.google.com/search?q=soybean+monoculture&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjwsofL86TaAhWhilQKHYeLBqsQ1QIIkgEoBQ&biw=1920&bih=949"
dwwd89k,PhreakOfTime,The price of soybeans is already approaching breakeven after the plunge yesterday. It's down again in overnight futures. What exactly do you think will happen to the price of *whatever crop* they try to switch to? Suddenly a large unexpected supply is being grown.And that's if all their costs are exactly the same over last year.Except farm equipment is now up double digit percentages in price due to the steel tariff. That wasn't just a tariff on steel. It's a tariff on everything made out of steel. Oops.
dwwf28z,WhatEverOkFine,"So what are you saying? We should just capitulate to China ( and their unfair trade practices ) or any country that buys crops from us so that farmers can continue to ""make great profits"" and buy more farm equipment? Look, I don't want farmers ( my grandfather farmed our family's land for as long as I can remember ) or any Americans to suffer, but if you ( like me ) really want the American quality of life to improve, then we need to bring back the days of ""Made in America"" when the average joe could have a decent job and raise a middle class family. I don't think we can do that as long as people and corporations are content to buy cheap, low-quality Chinese products at scale... to maximize profits."
dwsiedu,JesterV,Yep.
dwsjjfs,Doza13,More hits to red staters. It's almost enough to make me root for China.
dwsmjd1,InsertRandomUNHere,"I'm by no means a Trump supporter, but I read somewhere that these actions are based in retaliation to the Chinese practice of forcing US companies who'd like to do business in China to set up joint ventures with Chinese companies in order to absorb US technology know-how. Does the US do this with other foreign companies? Whether this trade battle results in any meaningful change on the part of China remains to be seen, but I do see Chinese joint-ventures as unfair to US companies who've toiled and spent resources building up their intellectual property."
dwspog8,tirius99,"Their house, their rules. Don't like it, don't do business there. China wants to develop their domestic businesses and they're at a disadvantage because they don't have the same resources as multi national corporations. If China was completely free, it would be the wild west as western corporations would just go in and do whatever it wants. Not exactly a winning strategy for China is it?"
dwspzhd,InsertRandomUNHere,I'm sure China could change the rules a bit to get something in return for US companies setting up shop there without resorting to IP theft.
dwsqhmn,tirius99,"It's not IP theft when companies, as you said willingly transfer technology to access Chinese markets. It's a give and take. You don't like it, don't start a business there."
dwsr0bb,InsertRandomUNHere,"In the US we have the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program where there is a mutually beneficial set-up--foreign investors come here, they invest in jobs for US workers and in exchange they are allowed to come here legally. The rules of engagement for the type of trade that exists between China and US seem to be skewed unfavorably against the US. Instead of gaining access to US IP, can the Chinese make another ask to benefit their country? I'm sure they can. This would be the perfect opportunity for the State Department to shine, but Trump is an ignoramus that doesn't believe in the power of diplomacy."
dwsr72n,tirius99,I agree with you. There are certainly room for negotiation between nations. As China often like to say it wants to pursue win-win scenarios. However raising tariffs unilaterally does not help matters. In fact it'll probably sour the Chinese public on the US.
dwsrg1c,InsertRandomUNHere,"Yep! Let's get something straight--Trump is a complete buffoon. While the intent might be noble, i.e. protect American companies from unfair IP practices, he's acting with very little sophistication. The world deserves better."

dwt9ehb,HouseofWessex,"I'm not an expert. But I can say that China could easily make high quality goods. But the question is *why would they?* More cost, less profits. Why not just try to undercut the opposition. China is low wage raw goods economy, not a service or high tech one like the US."
dwsuj0c,JakesBoolin,"The sentiment that China could win a trade war with the US is laughable. China has awful trade practices with no way of reciprocating for faulty or misrepresented goods. They import about 1% of US's exports and are completely reliant on the US's consumption to pay off their loans. And, most importantly, they can't innovate, they rely on theft to keep up with technological advances.

The steel and aluminum tariffs will hurt out automotive and airplane industry so much that any benefit to our steel producers will be offset. The only reason Trump wants these is because key counties in swing states have these industries, so the only true motive is political.So not only did we fuck over our manufacturers of final goods with steel and aluminum as inputs, now dozens of other industries will have their exports significantly reduced. Especially our agricultural sector is going to struggle because of how much food we send to China that will now be much less profitable."

dwsndoa,dildobagginss,"Sorry, I'm not familiar with this but does this basically mean that the US pays a 25% tax on these 106 products we export to China? Or how does this work exactly?"
dwspm3z,Hiriko,"It's basically a tax that the Chinese government will place on the products being imported for their own consumers.So say there's a 25% tariff placed on US cars. A US car company is trying to export their products to China. When exporting product you have to list the value of the product you are trying to sell. So say the cars are worth $10,000 each. A 25% tariff will increase the price of the cars to $12,500. So when the middle man in China wants to secure a supply of cars, instead of buying them for $10k each they have to buy them at $12.5k each. The extra $2500 tariff is taken by the Chinese government and the $10K price belongs to the US company.The way this is bad is because it it drive away consumers. The middle man will have to raise their own prices or operate at a loss. With such high tariffs, they are way more likely to just switch supply. So in my example a company in China will just try to find another supplier of similar cars who would not have the tariff placed, which means the US company will have a very hard time finding Chinese buyers.EDIT: The US company can also lower the price on the cars to work around the tariffs, but that obviously hurts them. So to get around a 25% tariff and allow the Chinese consumer to buy the cars at $10k, the US company has to drop the value of their car to $8000. (8000x1.25=10,000)"
dwsns6t,stillcole,"So, wouldn't this lead to lower domestic prices for the products on the tariff list? Assuming that the tariffs would lead to lower international sales a higher domestic supply"

But it seems that the country selling a good or product that can easily move to other markets, or countries that are willing to import without the additional tariffs can just stop selling their product to the one who does, thereby making the additional tariffs moot.

dwsl5gy,suscribednowhere,TRUMP HAS SMASHED HIS BRASS BALLS ON THE DEAL TABLE WITH CHINA
dwsixe2,GoodMerlinpeen,"Balls requires an understanding of the risks involved. Trump apparently has no real idea of what he is doing. He thinks these things are simple, which is indication enough that he has no idea about any of it."
dwsp99j,toth42,"Are you Chinese or American? Both Xi and Trump are presidents, presumably in possession of balls."
dwshyw6,Jaereth,Don't see the issue with this being a huge scenario like you never trumpers are making it out to be. We export typically high quality goods (why else would it be exported). China exports cheap crap that usually has lead in it.
dwt3pyp,,[deleted]
dwth7ck,keepitrealbro,What do the Chinese even buy? It's definitely not patents because they just steal those.
dwu8ido,bitwarrior80,"My grandpa's company sells China milling equipment and chemicals for manufacturing thermal barrier windows used in high rise buildings. All the chemicals are made in the US so the Chinese can't steal the process, so he says. The chemical exports are their bread and butter so the tariff reprisal is definitely going to hurt them."
dwz842c,keepitrealbro,Thanks for telling me about this. This is a good example. I wasn't sure what it would affect.
dwsh3iu,redline42,"we like our $200 TV's but want good paying jobs.Cant have both. You think Chinese companies invented something cutting edge to cut the price of a TV? no. Low wages and state subsidiesOne side employ's hundreds of millions of people on ""slave wages"" and is a pig in a suit economically and the other side ""The United States"" is an advanced high tech economy with a dwindling workforce because its cheaper to produce elsewhere. The good paying jobs we do have we happily give away to H-1B workers, who take less money than equally or greater skilled American workers would. So we either all start practicing how to wait tables or we do something about countries that pay millions of workers 1 dollar an hour to produce our beloved goods."

dwsna90,FblthpLives,"Look up these two words: ""free trade."" Trade under the WTO framework is by and large not subject to government controls. China joined WTO in 2001.

dwt7y9p,redline42,"Presidential Authority over Trade:Imposing Tariffs and Dutieshttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44707.pdfhere is the mission of the WTO The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. At its heart are the WTO agreements, negotiated and signed by the bulk of the world's trading nations and ratified in their parliaments. The goal is to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible.I do not believe the WTO has any say in this matter due to no formal trade agreements signed between China and the United States. The WTO could hear disputes on these tariffs but it would take many years to come to a settlement. The tariffs are being created as leverage to negotiate a fair deal with China and to get China to play fair. Either by opening their market to American goods like the US market is open to Chinese goods and to stop stealing American Intellectual Property by forcing companies that want to trade to disclose their products and their practices. This is a battle not a war. If anything it is merely a skirmish. If you noticed the Chinese are targeting products from states and corporations that support the President. A shrewd move meant to put pressure on him. I look at this as a gamble that will backfire because the goods the US is putting tariffs on are goods that China needs to move out to prevent oversupply and value depreciation. The Steel tariffs will directly hurt the Chinese economy due to its subsidizing the companies in that industry. That debt will not go away and be as much of a burden as the debt incurred in the Ghost Cities. At the same time, the US doesn't consider nuts and coffee vital domestic exports like they do with Computers and Airplanes. Yes they account for around $21 billion in agriculture trade they are not going to starve themselves. Are all these tariffs helpful? Probably not but they are at least a signal that the US is serious about fair trade and China needs to start complying to world norms. One issue with American companies over the last 35 years is their over dependence on the ""1 billion"" customers in China and not the rest of the world. This is coming to hurt them. We will see what the trade landscape looks like next year after this dies down and negotiations take place (hopefully)"
dwtajrm,FblthpLives,"> Presidential Authority over Trade: Imposing Tariffs and Duties The fact that tariffs can be imposed, does not mean the President routinely controls or interferes in trade.> I do not believe the WTO has any say in this matter due to no formal trade agreementsThis is incorrect.> The WTO could hear disputes on these tariffs but it would take many years to come to a settlementWhen the U.S. imposed steel tariffs in March 2002, the EU, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, Switzerland, and Brazil filed a dispute with the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. The ruling against the United States came in November of the same year, wich means it took 8 months or less.> This is a battle not a warThe tariffs imposed by China affect nearly 40% of U.S. exports to China.> I look at this as a gamble that will backfire because the goods the US is putting tariffs on are goods that China needs to move out to prevent oversupply and value depreciationThe U.S. will lose this trade war just as it lost in 2002 (and for the same reasons).> Probably not but they are at least a signal that the US is serious about fair trade and China needs to start complying to world normsThe tariffs imposed by Trump are universal and apply to all nations except Mexico and Canada. This argument is irrelevant. The U.S. already has 18 targeted sanctions in place that specifically address the steel mill issues with China:https://www.trade.gov/steel/countries/pdfs/exports-china.pdf[See the table labeled ""Steel Mill Trade Remedies in Effect Against China"".]> One issue with American companies over the last 35 years is their over dependence on the ""1 billion"" customersI don't even know what this means.

As for playing Chicken, don't make me laugh. China is a dictatorship with a strong military bent, it cannot afford to look weak, Trump by contrast is accountable to jittery politicians (who he needs to pass anything) who dislike trade wars and will lobby him to stop.

So overall our tariffs are less than half of China's. How do people view that as “fair” trade when the Chinese government makes twice as much off our products as we do?

Of course, it's best to avoid a tradewar but if it comes down to one, an insular country not dependent on exports and with a wealth of most natural resources isn't one you want to pick a fight with, especially when your own economy (meaning China's) is highly dependent on exports to support a hugely inefficient industrial sector.I hate Trump but he is doing something that American leaders should have done 15 years ago: fighting a relatively level laying field. This goes two ways, by the way, the USA has some absurdly protected industries, like China, in our case agriculture. We have flooded poor economies with heavily subsidized goods, wiping out local agricultural industries.At the end of the day, the world needs to be a bit more fair with trade and we need to try to move beyond zero sum geopolitics."

Of course companies would take a crisis and raise prices because they could, but there is no real reason for it to happen.How long before reality sets in and we can know the real effects of this once the initial knee jerk panic response is over?Also, if China wants to impact is like this, for political gain isn't that a trade war? Any country should be able to reasonably install tariffs without deer of it being considered a war, but now that we're here why not tarrifs everything from China and see what they think of that"

dwt3oo4,Sogdiana,"I think in this case it hurts both as the trade for example in soy beans happened because China was paying the 'right price' and USA was selling for the 'right price' times the quantity. Now that China has imposed tariffs on imports it means it will be cheaper for soy bean importers in China to avoid tariffs and buy from the runner up soy bean exporter after USA, which is likely to be slightly more expensive. So in the end Chinese importers pay a little bit more than optimal for soy beans and soy bean exporters in USA sell their produce for a little bit less to a different country. Which means both parties are negatively impacted. But the impact is unlikely to be as dramatic as some commenters in the thread would like to present.But if the supply and demand of the good is rare e.g. mars shuttles then the impact is huge on both sides. As the seller will struggle to find another buy for similair price and vise versa."
dwt1ljy,plb1990,"Serious question, what is stopping the US from simply imposing even more tariffs on China in response? I highly doubt that our export even comes close to matching what we take in, so surely there is an amount that would really hurt china more than it would hurt ourselves.Not saying I support the decision \(it was dumb\) but if we're taxing say 10&#37; and china does 50&#37;, wouldn't it really hurt china if we did 50&#37; in response?"

I, personally, wouldn't mind if I had to start my own victory garden or have to HIRE A FUCKING MECHANIC TO FIX MY TOASTER INSTEAD OF THROWING IT AWAY.There is nothing, not one thing, about having cheap shit by slave labor *no longer on the market* that bothers me.

dwsq1tb,skyleach,"My skills are the most in demand in the world. I haven't been screwed because I can't find work, I've been screwed because the entire foundation of the economy got screwed. I've been screwed because the dollar was weakened and the only place to get the buying power is by taxing the shit out of the middle class. The rich guys aren't going to fucking pay, they get a say in who has to. They can't tax the people with no jobs and food stamps, so it lands squarely on me and others like me.We have literally been turned into economic servants in this system, denied social programs because we earn too (welfare state) and denied tax shelters because we arne't rich (protectionism). We're the ones being ripped apart in this fucked-up system.Ever since Nixon the economy isn't tied to dollars. Why do you think the real estate market is so fucked? It's *real*. Why do you think they issued blue visas and allowed offshore skilled labor? Why do you think china was buying bonds left and right? Why do you think China finds it so easy to undercut our production costs? Jesus this is elementary shit, but the level of lies and BS otherwise intelligent people will spew in order to defend their milk-cow is depressing."
dwsr6rd,Grand_Imperator,"> Jesus this is elementary shitIt's not elementary shit, and you do realize your position does not find much support among economists? Are they all just dumb hacks who can't grasp ""elementary shit,"" or am I going to hear about how they are all part of a corrupt conspiracy?The real estate market is fucked, and there are several reasons for that. Part of it involves a lack of new housing, local governments and local constituencies engaging in NIMBYism about new development, concentration of good work in specific areas, and drawn-out litigation involving environmental concerns under NEPA (and any state equivalents, such as CEQA in California). The real estate market alone is not ""elementary shit,"" so I have a hard time buying your assertions that the broader overall economy or international trade are elementary shit, either.Yes, the middle class is shrinking, and I understand cutoff concerns between lack of eligibility for certain social programs and earning enough to take advantage of structuring taxes in a particular way.I don't see how tariffs are responsive to most of your concerns. It seems to me your concern is how much the middle class (or what's left of it) is squeezed on taxes or other social costs in a way that wealthier individuals manage to avoid. That sounds to me like a place to focus one's efforts. Unless you think a trade war will somehow focus attention on that area, I don't see the connection you are trying to draw."
dwsthf5,skyleach,"Either you see the connection and don't care, or you're dumb. Since the latter is probably not true, I think you do see it.First, the tariffs are just a replacement for regulation that doesn't exist in China but does exist in the U.S. The regulation isn't bad in any way. I could sit here and list a plethora of reasons why the tariffs are in the favor of both the left and the right, but we only need one good picture.[Here (imgur)](https://i.imgur.com/lp4Yf0g.jpg)The lower costs come with riders. The costs of production are lower for a reason. When you export the labor, you cut the purchasing power out of the economic base. For decades the U.S. has been losing industry because of regulation. That regulation is very very good for many reasons, most of which have to do with the environment and investment in renewable energy, baseline education standards, standard-of-living, civil rights, medical care... I could go on.Having business dodge regulation by offshoring their production is bad for everyone. It's a business decision to say 'fuck you America for trying to make us be good'. This isn't about money insofar as the number behind the $ symbol, it's about get-it-before-it's-gone economics. It's about greed.You can try to bamboozle me with talk of economics but it won't work. The economists aren't evil, they just aren't paid to take any of that into consideration. Lots and lots and lots of them [talk about this stuff](http://www.rff.org/files/sharepoint/WorkImages/Download/RFF-DP-98-29.pdf), but the guys making policy only promote the parts of it that supports their narrative and agenda. This isn't a conspiracy, it's human nature."
dwt0kpl,Grand_Imperator,"> First, the tariffs are just a replacement for regulation that doesn't exist in China but does exist in the U.S.I understand that argument. I also observed your image. Are the tariffs conditioned on China cleaning its rivers, paying its employees more, etc.? Not that I'm aware (perhaps I'm unaware), and I get to this problem below.> Having business dodge regulation by offshoring their production is bad for everyone.I understand that, but is there any way to compel China to respond with better regulations? Or will the result be that China imposes reciprocal tariffs (as has occurred?).> You can try to bamboozle me with talk of economics but it won't work.This statement sounds like you aren't interested in listening or having a dialogue. I'm not sure how you can claim these issues are so simple and easy, or imply that I might be dumb (though that is probably not true, of course), then just trot that line out.> The economists aren't evil, they just aren't paid to take any of that into consideration.Economists (and other academics) do attempt to factor in externalities, including environmental ones, into their work. Here are a few quick examples:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227362598_Externalities_and_Free_Trade_Agreementshttp://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/education_materials/modules/Trade_and_the_Environment.pdfhttp://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/019251298019004001I think the question is why tariffs are not often viewed as a solution despite awareness of and discussion on environmental externalities. Might it be because we have a complication in how to address those concerns between sovereign nations? I don't want to ""bamboozle"" you with discussions of international law, so I guess I won't go there to the extent I can avoid it.I'd feel more comfortable if these tariffs were imposed with a specific negotiation position that China could achieve more cheaply than the cost of the tariffs (unless the United States honestly thought it could argue from some sort of moral imperative to China). I don't see that in the tariffs imposed; I see this idea that this is supposed to help America get back to 'winning,' by somehow revitalizing our steel and aluminum industries, the remainder of those industries reliant on certain exports from China (or elsewhere) to do the work they still do domestically.I've also seen discussion of theft of American IP, which is a huge issue (but again likely would need some form of treaty or international court the parties could not walk away from in litigating those disputes).I understand your argument, and it has some intuitive appeal. I'm not inclined to believe it will work absent very clear proposed changes for China to undertake (preferably those that would be cheaper than China eating the cost of the tariffs, and cheap enough for China to decide it's not worth trying out the temporary tariff war to see if the United States will back down). I'm skeptical of moral high ground arguments or appeals to China altering the economics of any analysis in China changing its regulations or other policies.I'm also not inclined to believe the currently imposed sanctions have much, if anything to do with the points you have made. The United States is not going to bring back American Steel and Aluminum jobs from these tariffs. The United States likely is not going to resolve IP issues with China through these kinds of sanctions (and the current sanctions don't appear to target anything related to IP theft concerns, anyway). Why tax solar panels and washing machines? Is there IP theft there? Or is that just to try to do damage (while also not upsetting one's political base, a portion of whom might think solar panels are a joke). Perhaps there are IP concerns in the aerospace industry and medical supply industry, but nothing there looked particularly remarkable to me (as in, relates to patent infringement of some kind).Perhaps the current administration will become more refined and granular about their goals and approach in due time. I'm not holding my breath."

Second of all, China did not start a lot of trade with US until the 80s and 90s, how do you think corporations like Walmart, etc. got rich? The normal people of China did not get rich, but these venture capitalist did. A lot of old Chinese inventions were stolen by the Arabs/white people too, like the compass, the printing press, the gunpowder, etc. And China is improving on its IP protection, it is slowly coming around on the copyright things. And tariffs are imposed by every country in term of fair play, it's not just the US and China that does this, but every country has some sort of protection against dumping of goods. But of course, 90% of these shitting on China are fucking morons and no fucking clue how the world really works."
dwsijc7,,"The idea that China somehow 'owns' the US is a myth. China owns a lot of debt and could call it up, but doomsday sayers always forget that THE single largest holder of American debt is the US government, Americans and American institutions themselves. China owns something like only 8% or less of total outstanding public debt while Americans themselves own the vast majority of it. The social security administration owns a massive quantity of it, for example. Despite the fact that Americans tend to be negative, the US is much more powerful economically than it is given credit for. And it isn't like the US is the only country with debt. The Chinese themselves are ringing up huge levels of deficits and will surpass the US very soon."

dwshcr3,DKmann,Is it me or do not many people on Reddit understand that the person who pays the tariffs is the end user - YOU. Whether in China or or America the tariff (or reaction to the tariff) is passed on to YOU. This really doesn't affect most of the manufacturers or farmers - they'll still produce what they produce and you're just going to pay more for it. This is pretty much how our oil market works.
dwsijlw,JesterV,Not completely. When certain manufacturers or producers raise their prices then other manufacturers in producers become more competitive. If people don't want to pay the extra prices they look elsewhere to fulfill their needs. I think that's how China got wealthy in the first place.

dwsknz1,john22544,"I have a few thoughts on this. First of all nobody wins in a trade war. Secondly most people agree that China has been kind of screwing over the West on trade, but everybody is afraid to do anything about it. Thirdly that the majority of vocal redditors would like to see China badly hurt the United States if it is bad for Trump. I have another thought here. I think China just blinked. A lot of people are looking at this like a tit-for-tat because the Chinese proposed tariffs are roughly equivalent to Trump's proposed tariffs. But given the trade imbalance it is more like China just went all in. The DOW has already recovered half of what it lost. Soybeans have already recovered half of what they lost. So maybe I'm not the only one thinking along these lines. I hate Trump's style. I can't stand the man. And I wish he weren't President. And I am very scared that he is going to fuck up and crash the economy. But let's not pretend like the US hasn't been getting screwed by China on trade and that everyone is afraid to do anything about it. Old Chinese curse (that may or may not be Chinese)--May you live in interesting times."
dwskwsz,CubicalWarriorSTL,Since China exports more than they import. They should just ignore the tariffs that trump proposed. By adding tariffs people may start to see how imbalanced the trade is and how many tariffs they have on American products. I get they want to save face but they should have been more subtle.
dwsl0bb,rowingnut,"Argentina had a lousy soybean harvest. So China has the USA and Brazil to buy from. Brazil is at the beginning of their harvest and cannot increase soybean planting's quickly. China put a 25% Tariff on pork, figuring they could make up some of the slack with their domestic hog production. They have been hellbent in mimicking the USA in its animal husbandry practices. What do they import to feed the hogs? Soybeans. Chinese consumer is going to scream."
dwskwwc,SpudgeBoy,"> Thirdly that the majority of vocal redditors would like to see China badly hurt the United States if it is bad for Trump. Which one of the right wing talk shows was spouting garbage? I see you folks repeating it, but I don't se anybody else saying it. Ergo strawman."
dwslbep,john22544,"I've never heard a talk show, right wing or otherwise, talk much about reddit. I'm basing in on being an active reddit user for the last 20 months.

dwsz47y,brockodilus,China grows 12 million tons of soy. USA grows 108 million tons. Trump has the upper hand here.
dwszarj,AvalancheZ250,"I don't think you understand. China slapping tariffs on soy means that less Chinese consumers will buy US-grown soy, driving down soy prices for US farmers. This will reduce their income. The US *wants* China to buy their soy. Its not the other way around in this case."
dwszfx3,brockodilus,"I don't think you understand. Unlike other soy consuming nations, the pricing of soy in USA is more significantly determined by increased bio-diesel demand - where the soy oil is used to fuel combustion engines. Edit: also if you've been to China you'd know you're wrong. Soy is in everything there. They NEED soy, it's ingrained in their culture. China *wants* to buy soy."
dwt05tk,epote,So what is stopping them from buying Brazilian?
dwt0fz9,brockodilus,"It's way more expensive because it has higher protein content and non-GMO. If they deal with Brazil it will create a global outcry if they start slashing and burning more rainforest for goddamn soy. Trump has them up against the wall. If China starts trading more with Brazil and Argentina, it will actually drive soy prices up thanks to supply/demand. Supply will be essentially reduced by more than half without USA, and prices will double? Triple? Maybe more? These countries can have hurricanes and natural disasters and more pests than USA - this happened with vanilla many years ago. It was cheap then a hurricane wiped out production for years and prices went up like 2000%. Trumps a genius honestly, Chinese are just posturing here to rile up the dumbass masses. Edit: vanilla thing happened around 2000 when it was about $20/kg, cyclone hit Madagascar and t went up to $250/kg by 2004. Levelled off back down to $20 again but just recently another cyclone hit and it's currently at over $600/kg. So up 3000%"
dwt07b8,wagsman,The tariffs would affect the price of US soy in China. Perhaps in time the price in the US could be affected by overproduction due to the lack of Chinese demand.
dwt1pe9,akanosora,Brazil is the second largest seller of soy to China. China would simply import more soy from Brazil. Not a big deal for Chinese consumers but a huge deal for US farmers.
dwt06m4,dust_wind,How?
dwt8ziv,HouseofWessex,"Ummm...wrong way around. China is buying, but it's the US that needs to sell to China, where the tariffs are being placed. US placed tariffs mean nada, because China only has 12 million tonnes and hardly exports any of it. But most of those 108 million US tons are exports, meaning any Chinese tariffs will hit them hard and rive down their profit margins. Your numbers have merely proved why the US has a much weaker hand here."

dwsqut2,butterball6,Several of the tariffs such as those on pork and soy beans are targeting areas of the country that supported Trump. China is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans so now demand for these U.S. products will fall and all the farmers and producers wont be able to sell as much. In general it just lowers demand for all the U.S. goods that are having tariffs placed on them while sending Chinese buyers to competing countries that can now sell these same things to them at better prices.

dwspcef,mkrmec,"As I said, if the US doesn't have something, what stops them from making a company that start producing that product. They probably have all the raw materials needed. And if they don't, they can research alternatives.I don't have any data of what I said, but prove me wrong on what I said. A country as big as USA probably don't have problems with raw materials.Quickly downvote everything I said, because logic demands that free thoght must be rated."
dwsq0cv,danderiwander,"I didn't downvote you anywhere so stop cribbing lol.No, US just cannot start producing anything they want right off the bat. Case in point- food production where the US imports a lot because their local produce isn't enough. There's a lot of factors that are involved in manufacturing and no, just having a lot of land does not mean shit. For example, the US cannot randomly start mass producing batteries because the raw materials required aren't present in abundance here. Importing them is going to be more expensive for someone in an isolationist economy than someone like China who mass produce for the whole damn world.So yes, you had no idea of what you said which is why I asked you about it. Got my answer though. Thanks."
dwsqj61,mkrmec,"There are batteries that dont need lithium, and there are many batteries researched that dont need litium. As I said researching new materials is a good alway to avoid products you don't have.I generalized the votedown logic, it wasn't only for you.US has lots of fertile land, they can replace many industrial crops to food production crops. I doubt they can't feed themselfs.Land = raw materials chance is they have everything, but if they dont, they will get is somehow, or replace with something else.You want China to have a monopoly on everything and let them have all the jobs and money? You must be crazy if that sounds good to you."
dwsr6xa,danderiwander,"Jeez. More fail logic on top of fail logic. Batteries don't only need lithium. Batteries that don't need lithium need something else. No, the US does not have those materials because a majority of those materials are currently being sourced from Africa. Unless the US can find out a way to grow minerals which I doubt they will. US does NOT have a lot of fertile land. They have a lot of land. A lot of crops cannot be grown in the US. There's a reason why a majority here grow corn and that's because they cannot grow anything else sustainably. You shouldn't doubt they can't feed themselves. THEY CANT. It's a fact which you can easily google. And finally land != raw materials lol. There's no chance they have everything and that's because there's actually very few areas in mainland US that haven't been explored. On top of that, there's manufacturing cost. Nobody is going to buy a battery that costs 50$ to produce in the US when it can be made for $2 in China. China has a monopoly because they can afford to do so. The US can't because of the costs involved in a lot of cases. You think people would be willing to pay double or triple the price because it's made in the USA? No. US's strength is in it's IP. China's strength is in it's manufacturing. That's how a global economy works."
dwss6rl,mkrmec,"So tou think that Chinas prodicts will be priced low forever? They will nevee increase the prices on anything? Specially after they have the biggest monopolies ever? Giving the power to destroy a nation to foreign country is just idiotic.If you think only China can do shit ""That's how global economy works"" it's not global, it's Chinese based and monopoly."
dwst0qp,danderiwander,China was an example. They are not the only ones manufacturing. And thanks for not refuting any of those points. Clearly shows your understanding of the subject and the reason why support of these tariffs exists.
dwstbn6,mkrmec,"I told you already what I think, I don't have the need to produce a novel while chatting. You claim one thing, I claim other things.

dwsuxek,mkrmec,"Facts come with sources and study papers, not from some casual person on Reddit.Acting like your way is the only was was dictatorship like, not the ""facts""."
dwsvoso,danderiwander,I'd expect you to google before making chest thumping claims but anyways. Here's a good starter:https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/09/17/221376803/american-farmers-say-they-feed-the-world-but-do-theyAmerica's largest produce is dominated by corn and soy. You can look more into why corn and soy is more profitable to farmers than other crops.
dwsw9f6,mkrmec,"I'd expect if you make claims that you prove them also. As I said my comment was my personal opinion, I wasn't trying to prove anything, I did respond to you and others to explain my opinion more and you tried to shut me down immediately, like the world can't handle two opinions. It's their choice, we will see if they adapt to it. I'm not from the US, but I see how almost all businesses in my country were destroyed by foreign ones, many people are poor because of that, and the EU was/is the cause of this. Plus they let millions of refugees into our countries ""citing"" we have job openings... Bullshit!! The are actively trying to make us jobless.ATM I want a Trump like president to fuck over the EU and tell them to fuck off with their idiotic policies."
dwswljm,danderiwander,I just provided a link to prove my claim. Waiting for you. Here's another depicting agricultural land in the US. Notice how it's almost the same as India despite the US being much bigger in size:http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Agriculture/Arable-land/HectaresThere's a difference between having a lot of land and it actually being arable for the crops you need to feed your population.
dwsxcka,mkrmec,"And you know for a fact that corn that is used for ethanol, can't be used for food in case like this? Corn bread is my fav. bread after all. Or maybe convert corn land that can produce other plants to other plants. ,Anyway I had enough of this back and forth."
dwsxkfz,danderiwander,No. Corn cannot be the only ingredient in a staple diet. You need a lot of other vegetables and fruits that cannot be mass produced in the US. Corn is produced so much specifically because of the climate here and the profitability. You think people don't research this? What do you think? That you stop producing corn on a land and start growing rice there just like that? Jesus 😂
dwso4i5,LivingLegend69,"> This is exactly what will boost domestic production in US, and exactly what Trump wanted, less dependance on foreign products, more domestic products. I see this only as a good thing.The US buys a ton of things from China for which there no longer exists a domestic industry. And these will never come back because they arent sustainable at US loans. Instead of China the US will then by from Vietnam, Bangladesh etc. or just pass the higher price onto the consumer. How is this a good thing?"
dwsobmq,mkrmec,Do you know for a fact that these businesses wil never come back? You don't. There might be more changes by Trump that even those businesses can come back.
dwswmya,LivingLegend69,> Do you know for a fact that these businesses wil never come back? You don't.I do because I actually have a background in economics and can crunch the numbers. Unless the US customer is prepared to pay a multiple of the current price for many articles of clothing for example that industry is never ever coming back. The same applies for most cheap household electronics and toys. If anything the US will buy from Vietnam and Bangladesh instead of China now.
dwswz2b,mkrmec,"Ok, we will see what they do."
dwsoaip,El_Raro,Until you need foreign products because you can't source them domestically and you end up shooting yourself in the dick.
dwsofq7,mkrmec,"The US has a lot of land, I bet they have almost everything they need. If not, they will buy at a higher price. Not the end of the world."
dwsosd7,ClevelandSportsGuy,Unless you're poor and can't afford a high price. Then it becomes the end of the world pretty fucking quickly.
dwsp0u2,mkrmec,"High prices are only aplicaboe whrn theres a monopoly on that product, if you have many companies competing the prices are lower.If the US brings more jobs with this, the people won't be so poor anymore."
dwsq81m,ClevelandSportsGuy,Higher prices are ALWAYS applicable when products because more expensive to make the number of competing firms is irrelevant to this fact. Historically mercantilism has been tried in the past and failed. There's a reason that we had (prior to Trump) freer trade recently than at any other time in the past. Reducing free trade won't bring jobs to the US however it likely will lead to an economic crisis depending on how far this trade war goes.
dwsqw7q,mkrmec,"Only time will tell, if they stick with it. These days new materials can be researched, others replaced, etc. There isn't the end of the world if something isn't available as it was in the past.I know what you mean and I understand it. It applied in the past, but I think it doesnt apply anymore.Prior to Trump their economy was going to shit, Obama destroyed it even more with his socialism / communism tactics.As I said. We will see, how it goes for them. Total dependancy on China because its cheaper there, definitely isn't the way. It is only good for China and rich people who distribute Chinese products in the US."

dwsmj03,SegoLilly,"It is true that China has been cheating and stealing for a long, long time, and on that note I am glad it is being addressed at last. I am not enthused about the methodology however.Were it up to me, I would just start collecting paper. Lots of it. Proof of China's cheating and massive intellectual property theft, and then I would publish it. If the emperor won't walk down the street with no clothes on, then take his pants down. The data dump would be YUUUGE. It would be multilingual. It would name a lot of names. More on this later.Next step, there would be a lot of Chinese nationals getting the boot from the USA. Can't speak English worth a damn and lied about your abilities to get into college?Buh-bye! Law's changed! Adios! Using real estate to hide illicit money from the government?-It is ours now. The money you smuggled out of China was ill gotten gains to begin with and violated the law. But-new law- you compounded it by buying property that you had no intention of residing in and solely wanted to use as a slush fund. The US is not in the business of letting that property collect dust and rot when a large generation needs housing NOW. Using your plane ticket for birth tourism?-You have a court date and your child's citizenship can be revoked, since in truth you and your family do not give a damn about this country and are no better than conmen. You are only giving birth here to take advantage of laws meant for residents of the US who are culturally American and want to go to college. It is not the US's problem that China has a corrupt university system and not our job to subsidize your kid's education if he didn't make it through the gaokao. GET IN LINE.Getting back to the paper, every illegal deal, every violation of the WTO going back to 1989, and every embarassing detail of how party officials and Chinese companies REALLY operate would get dumped in multiple languages around the planet. I would move in for the kill and tell the tech monopolies in CA that they'd better get used to the idea of manufacturing anywhere but China and behind the scenes I would work on incentives to bring back more factories HERE. (I would also detail the Chinese dealings of Steve Jobs. I have a feeling they are dirty.) I would then flood the WTO with multiple instances of fraud and corruption. As for tariffs, they'd find that I have another report on my desk regarding pollution...and a little red button that I can push if I decide to dump more data. Tick tock, CCP. Tick tock.."
dwsmomt,5e0295964d,">Using your plane ticket for birth tourism?-You have a court date and your child's citizenship can be revoked, since in truth you and your family do not give a damn about this country and are no better than conmen.I agree with pretty much everything you say but this, it's a slippery slope between removing citizenship for people breaking immigration laws put in place after they're citizens and future cases where the definition of a broken laws can be expanded to take away more citizenship rights."
dwsphi4,SegoLilly,"I would create an acid test just for that case, and make crystal clear within the language that the law is not to be applied to other groups as its purpose is to stop the corruption of Chinese birth tourism.It is very simple.It is a test. It has more than one edition and its answers get changed regularly for each edition. On the test are very simply questions about law, culture, and history. It would have an oral section and a written one. You can't write in Chinese-English only. You also automatically fail if you do not speak a word of English and it combines with you having no record of ever living anywhere in the US full time for a prolonged period. Example question: Who beat the Japanese and did most of the fighting in WWII, the Kuomingtang or Mao's Red Army?*Chinese nationals have been lied to for generations about this. Mao hid like a rat and let Chiang Kai Shek take the hit in numbers so he could finish him off once the Japanese left. This question is by design: it proves where someone was educated. And political beliefs. The Chinese government is unlikely to change their textbooks anytime soon, and it would be difficult for them to protest the truth on a test.*There would also be a very simple question for someone to answer: ""have you or any member of your family, immediate or otherwise, had any business or political ties with the CCP?"" If they lie, buh-bye! A lot of these people DO have those ties. The CCP in practice indirectly owns most businesses in China.The point of it would be to prove how connected you are to the USA. If you cannot speak the language at all, if you know zip about any US film save for what the CCP has allowed to be screened, if on paper the only thing you seem to care about is getting to college, that is it. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. The Chinese government can scream like toddlers about the Chinese Exclusion Act Take Two, but silkily the reply will be, ""You always say 'do not meddle in our internal affairs!' whenever the world does not like what you do. We're returning the same message this time. And by the way, reform the gaokao and actually build more universities and stop paying for sex from 21 year old girls who should be in school and not whoring themselves out to gross old men like imperial concubines.""It would be sweeter when a sudden hack on WeChat gets through long enough for the entire message to flow through China like a torrent through Niagara Falls. And a virus opens up a rather humiliating file that shows a CCP member in flagrante delicto with a young girl... and video of exactly HOW MANY OF THESE GIRLS HE HAS ON THE SIDE AT A TIME WHEN THE BIRTH RATIO IN CHINA IS INSANELY SKEWED. (The message behind the scenes to the others on the Central Committee would be to think carefully about what they do next. Unlike the Soviet Union, we don't live in a time where information is transmitted in manila folders and written on typewriters. We should take advantage of that and more aggressively try to break through the Great Wall with the truth.)"

dwt3wk8,docboz,"You bring up soy. Why? It really isn't the healthiest food for people as it increases the estrogen levels in a person. A woman BRCA markers certainly shouldn't be eating it and men should not be as well. Most soy is also GMO. Monsanto, a leader in GMO production is in cahoots with many govt agencies and literally owns the seeds which produce food. Not only have GMO products been linked to be carcinogenic. They literally take over organic farms if their seeds are found there. Also pork organs... really what percentage of our GDP is that. Is it even a percent? Pork organs are the least of our worries. The fact you brought that up specifically proves there isn't a whole lot to be worries about here."
dwt75cd,akanosora,"Yeah, tell that to pork and soy farmers. Soys are not all consumed directly by the way."
dwtzi9r,docboz,There is a ton of soy we consume. I assume you mean “non tofu” by indirectly as tofu is soybean. Wether these farmers are happy with the science or not does not change the fact that soy contributes to the tremendous amount of omega 6 fatty acids we get in our diet offsetting the 2:1 to omega 3s we should be getting. Offsetting this balance promotes severe health effects. Companies like Monsanto are trying to directly control food supply.

dwuv3xh,HouseofWessex,"No, because all economists agree that the jobs these tariffs are fighting to protect are far far less in number than farmers. We're fighting to save manufacturing that was going out of business due to automation and lower wages elsewhere, and in doing so screwing over farmers, the one group that actually has a trade *surplus.* We're throwing out the PS4 here all in order to save Sega genesis."
dwv9pe4,docboz,"She's genesis for ps4 what does that even mean? “All” including of anything is always a false statement-for the future. As time changes, as new and better ways of doing things are discovered, and as supply and demand changes someone always gets the short end. Its economy and part of life.

dwukcmp,FblthpLives,"The reason I don't understand what you say, is because you used the term ""forgive debt."" What you are describing now is the exact opposite of forgiving debt and it is called defaulting. If the U.S. defaults on its debt, its sovereign debt credit ratings will be slashed, interest rates will soar, the dollar will crash as foreign nations and investors sell of their Treasury notes, inflation will increase dramatically, and the U.S. economy will enter a recession that will make The Great Depression look like a cake walk. You have no idea what you are asking for and it is quite obvious you don't understand the linkage between sovereign debt, interest rates, and currency exchange rates."
dwul9x3,JaceLightning,"I was using language as a tool. Notice how I put quotes around the word ""forgive.""It's not really ""defaulting"" either in the traditional sense, and I'm not convinced any of those things would happen. Normally entities default when they are financially lacking, and which tanks their credit rating, etc., etc. Obviously you're a bad investment if you have no money. But in this case, it's more of a punitive measure. The US would be punishing China for its misgivings. And that isn't indicative of being a bad investment, per se.If you wanted to make it ""right"" on paper, the US could just fine China $2 Trillion for IP infringement (or more, maybe $6T to cover the last 10 years, yikes! https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/opinion/china-us-intellectual-property-trump.html) and then turn around and be ""huh, you owe us $2 trillion dollars, and we've loaned you $2 trillion. That's kinda interesting. We'll just take what you owe us from our debt."" Companies have tried suing, but the Chinese government protects its own companies (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0bNf-jcVU0)I know what you're going to say: ""That's not how any of this works."" First, there's no reason it _couldn't_ work like that. The country doing the fining is the country making the laws here, so they can effectively do whatever they want. Second, I'm saying this is how it _should_ work to deal with a country like China."
dwutrgh,FblthpLives,"> I was using language as a tool. Economics has terms that mean things. ""Forgive"" has a specific meaning, and it is literally the opposite of what you mean. If you want to have a debate about a topic in economics, you can't use your own language and expect someone else to understand.> It's not really ""defaulting"" either in the traditional senseWhat you are describing is the United States defaulting on its debt to China. That's what the term is for when you don't pay the debt that you owe, which is exactly what you are saying. It would have catastrophic consequences, because other lenders to the U.S. would dump their U.S. treasury notes. Foreign governments and investors hold over $8 trillion in U.S. treasury notes. I guarantee you the result of a sell-off in these would not be pretty.> The country doing the fining is the country making the laws hereApart from not knowing economics, you also don't understand international law. You are living in a fantasy world.Instead of pointing the fingers at others, maybe you should start taking a look at the fiscal problems of the United States: Your government is running record levels of debts, just implemented a deficit-funded tax cut that will substantially worsen the situation, and the country has a sub-standard gross savings rate, which is the route cause of your trade deficit."

For example. Stay in America and make the car for say $8000. Or leave America and make the car for $4000 but then pay $4000 to be able to sell the car in America. That's how it should be. Someone made deals so you can go to Mexico and make the car for $4000 and then ship it back into America for almost nothing and sell it and make a ton of profit.

Said he doesn't mind taking the hit if the US can get China to the negotiating table quickly."
dwtezva,damsel-inadress,He's saying that now but what if he looses his farm? Margins are not huge in agriculture and it's not super easy to switch up what you're growing - often have to wait for next year and then take a chance that the price of the new crop can pay your bills. Time will tell if this was a great move for the US. I'm confident the Chinese are not out to benefit the US with this move so I would be very surprised if it doesn't hurt at all.
dwub24g,akanosora,Most Chinese citizens actually support the government go against the US this time because they see this as part of the never ending western aggression against China and this soy farmer greatly underestimated the resilience Chinese can pull towards the outside pressure.

dwsoyw7,kocorin,"It wasn't senseless though. It is a stupid move, but a meaningful one. China has been abusing trade rules for decades. They already have restrictions and tariffs( they have a 25% tax on foreign cars) on many American goods for a long time now. Forcing companies to give up IP, banning certain companies outright, so their domestic company can have no competition. Foreign companies have to form 50/50 ventures with local Chinese companies (many owned by the Chinese govt). This usually ends up with the Chinese company stealing all the know hows and compete with the foreign company. That's what happen to two high speed train manufacturer. Siemens(Germany) and kawasaki(japan), formed joint ventures in China with local chinese companies. Did they make money? yes, but after a few years the very same chinese companies were expanding and selling designs identical to the Germans and Japanese. The bottom line is, China does not follow most of the rules that everyone else follows. They will do whatever it takes to get their hands on foreign IPs. That's the main reason why President Obama worked so hard to try and get the TPP to pass. It formed an alliance with other countries and tried to force the Chinese into submission. Of course the damn GOP and Trump would fucked up and ruin TPP."

dwsqhw7,MrNotSpecified,"The money will be much less efficiently spent here because our economy is not production-based, so possible outcomes to this are: 1. companies buy from a different supplier, who will likely have higher prives than we used to have with china. 2. Companies buy less, causing a shortage and subsequent price hike. 3. Companies keep buying the same, but just hike the price. 4. Companies shift their production to another country (which will cost money and probably increase prices.).While trade does make us lose money, we not only get a cheaper product than we would get than if we were to make it ourselves, but we save the time it would take us to make it and we can instead specialize on things which create the most value which ends up being more beneficial to the economy. Also, the new price increases will lose way more jobs than they create, because demand will fall. Not to mention the problems this causes for poor people."

dwu5scz,SeppGoodell,"Oh no, no chinese cars lol"
dwu78bu,akanosora,What are you talking about? These are US cars exported to China not the other way around!
dwu7cp8,SeppGoodell,I admit my ignorance and stupidity and will leave it up
dwskm49,hapinessandsunshine,"Yes!!! This is why I voted for this president, finally some protectionism for the US"
dwslvz2,embarrassed420,This moron started a trade war for no reason
dwso41d,CmMozzie,god damn you're blind
dwso7b1,hapinessandsunshine,You're the blind one
dwsov9e,CmMozzie,"GL with your trade war, I'll be watching the shitshow on the sidelines munching on popcorn. Seeing your country fall apart after trump got elected seems like a full time job now adays."
dwsp1vq,hapinessandsunshine,It's only getting stronger hahaha. I hope trump starts a war cos it would get the economy started again
dwsqr1x,CmMozzie,"Your country isn't getting stronger, my god keep reading the propaganda. Sheeple"
dwsrpvp,,[removed]
dwsrxpk,CmMozzie,Typical response from the average Trump supporter. You prove otherwise you started claiming the opposite with no sources or facts.
dwszci2,A_N_M,Hahaha time to bring back out chemical plants. We don't need China cars or soy. Soy reduces testosterone production in men anyways. No more Soy Boys
dwt01yz,TUBE___CITY,I'm pretty sure you don't know how tariffs work
dwt1hvy,akanosora,China is putting tariffs on soy produced by the US farmer and sold to the Chinese market. Not the other way around... China is the biggest buyer of US soy products.
dwt4kyb,SuspiciouslyElven,"No, it drives down the price of soy in our own market. Which means soy is going to find its way into even more products as a filler."

dwt037k,ohyeahbonertime,Most of these guys are retarded.
dwt0lux,CubicalWarriorSTL,They already had a 25% tariff.
dwsewe1,fshowcars,Fuck China
dwsqioc,PROGRAMMER_FOR_TRUMP,"Reddit right now: ""WTF I'm moving to China because it's so great. Donnie le Drumpf made me stand up for China!!!! He's clearly racist against Chinese people. My degree in Chinese dance will finally be useful. I fully understand economics, because I read two blog posts on U.S. - China trade."""
dwsseg3,prof_red,"Trump will be gone in 3 years, just hold out"
dwsxgv1,RiffyDivine2,> I'm moving to China Yeah good luck with that.
dwsg9ij,Mrtheliger,I can't wait for China to come crawling back in a year or two.
dwsioyw,TheodoreLinux,yeah...okay.
dwsiroz,Mrtheliger,What? It's bound to happen? Sort by controversial and read the comments. Some even give sources. China is gonna fall apart without America's constant aid.
dwsk6ii,guitarguywh89,Good thing theUS doesnt borrow trillions from China.oh... wait...
dwsf51q,Wulfnuts,Just ban all Chinese products and see how they like it. The whole country exists on exports
dwsfnb3,sarcastroll,Then they drop an economic nuke on us by dumping t-bills. Trump just borrowed a couple trillion for his rich person giveaway. An increase in borrowing costs would be devastating.
dwsl2wb,nutweave,I guess the Obama status quo is what reddit wants where we return to China raping the US and exploiting our economy.
dwslgka,embarrassed420,"What does Obama have to do with Trump starting a trade war? Oh that's right, literally nothingAccept that your president is an absolute moron instead of trying to support his efforts for no reason"
dwsls1w,nutweave,So what should we do about China exploiting our economy and getting rich off of it while we get fucked? Just take it? How about you offer some solutions instead of talking shit?
dwslzxc,embarrassed420,"Well we certainly shouldn't yell at them on twitter and start a trade war, you idiot"
dwsm90b,nutweave,"Just as I figured, you only know how to talk shit. Typical leftie, offer no solutions just cry. Your username fits.Now, in the future, before you talk shit on the internet, think about how to fix the problem you are bitching about and actually use it in your response instead of ""lol trump sux upvote to the left, fuck gop""."
dwsml62,embarrassed420,Wait what do you mean? US/China relations had been great until trump entered office. He started talking shit for no reason and pushed some of our closest allies away (except Russia of course!)Anyone with half a brain can tell that a mindless trade war isn't a good thing. I don't need to have my own comprehensive national economic plan to know that basic factTypical rightist gaslighting
dwsn991,nutweave,"US/China relations? That's not what is being discussed. I'm sure if I were making billions off of a country while they are getting fucked, I'd be a happy camper too.https://apjjf.org/data/Chart_2.jpgThis is about China exploiting the US while they move up in the world and we move down. You would rather keep it status quo and let China fuck us indefinitely rather than address the issue so it's a somewhat fair playing field?The same thing can be seen with your guys' position on North Korea. You would rather avoid confrontation and let the other side become more powerful than address it and take some heat."
dwsnbps,CmMozzie,You literally talked shit without offering any solutions either. My god how are you so blindly dumb.
dwsyg3n,nutweave,"Well if it wasn't obvious enough, I was making the argument defending Trump's move on putting tariffs on Chinese steel while the guy I was arguing with thought it was a ""senseless"" trade war. Then again, I'm dealing with idiots here."
dwsejw7,catlikeastronaut,"Ic ant' help but lol at this list of liberal products!! No body cares China because REAL americans have all WE need right here, including our firearms baby! and when you see us coming over that hill locked and loaded it won""t be to take your soy lololololol. And people still think there's Ccollusion,, sad, when theres just VICTORY!!!"
dwsex94,-TheFalcon-,Id park two carrier battlegroups right in the China Sea and beg them to blink. China been raping our country with cheap non-functional plastic bullshit for way too long.
dwsfy49,sarcastroll,And then do what? Open fire when they implement tariffs? And lose 2 carrier groups to ship killers? Start a full blown war and end life in the US (and world)?Brilliant plan.Or would you park them there and do nothing when more tariffs are implemented or our bonds flooded into the market by China?
dwsgdao,-TheFalcon-,"War with China is inevitable. I'd rather fight it than my kids or grandkids. Look at every metric when it comes to their policies. President Xi Jinping has been quoted saying he would fight a bloody battle to gain its ""rightful"" place in the world. The trade wars are only the beginning."
dwt7lqt,the_alpha_turkey,"Ah yes gotta love how the world feels like they own my nation.We try to raise one tariff on steel and what happens? All our allies that we have been protecting since the end of World War One turn on us and threaten us with tariffs.Then China wants to increase tariffs on almost every American product? We try to stimulate our economy and the whole fucking world turns on us? Honestly, fuck our allies and fuck China. Our allies are filthy little traitors that do nothing but drain NATO resources and don't even abide by the treaty. We should let the Russian have at you.Then fuck China for being a over reacting little bitch of a nation that feels like they have a RIGHT to our markets. I'm going to get downvoted to hell for this, I don't give a shit. I want my nation to have jobs, I want my fellow country man to be prosperous. The whole world feels like that have the fucking right to have a say in my nation, you don't. You don't fucking live here, you aren't a citizen. You don't get to dictate how we operate. We aren't your fucking colonies."
dwtcojw,tarepandaz,>All our allies that we have been protecting since the end of World War One turn on us and threaten us with tariffs.Is this satire or real? It's getting hard to tell these days.
dwt7v65,HouseofWessex,"You do realise that "" I want my nation to have jobs, I want my fellow country man to be prosperous. The whole world feels like that have the fucking right to have a say in my nation, you don't. You don't fucking live here, you aren't a citizen"" is literally what China and the EU are also thinking, and why they're acting this way.If someone acts like an asshole and punches you in the face, wouldn't you punch them back? At the very least, you cannot blame them for it. If the US doesn't want to be hit by tariffs than DON'T GO AROUND PUTTING TARIFFS ON OUR GOODS!"
dwt8sx5,the_alpha_turkey,"You are delusional. The steel tariff was a obvious play to make steel produced in the states cheaper to steel produced in China. Oh and the tariff was only directed at China, it was a tariff on Chinese steel. Not European steel.So the tariff was meant to revitalize American steel production. So Europe, a nation almost affected by the new tariff, and China. Band together to threaten America into submission.You realize what this is all about right? Europe and China want a market for their goods, that market is America. The rest of the world wants us to be a complacent little consumer economy and provide Europe with protection.Claiming that Europe and China have the best interests of American citizens by threatening these tariff is the most asinine and idiotic thing I have ever heard.Europe hates America, despite us being the only thing between them and Russia. China hates America despite us being the largest consumer of their goods."
dwta40q,TUBE___CITY,China isn't even in the top ten countries the US imports steel from so it seems more antagonistic than helpful. How is putting a tariff on 2% of steel imports going to bolster the economy?
dwvc8d7,pataglop,Aaaand he will never answer you. Idiots like him just melt and run away when faced with logic and reason.
dwtbzrz,discountedeggs,There's not enough raw steel refined in the US to meet domestic demand. Imposing tariffs only increases cost for steel users in the US.
dwtxevw,Nixon4Prez,"Claiming that the US didn't threaten to tariff the EU makes you either a liar or incredibly ignorant. The US threatened *global* steel tariffs. That means China, but also the EU, Canada, Mexico, etc. And no, the EU doesn't have the best interests of American citizens at heart, they have the interests of EU citizens at heart. Do you expect countries to roll over and let the US take advantage of them?"
dwukne2,FallingSwords,They are used to getting their own way in America and they just throw a tantrum if they don't
dwtnbu9,ensalys,"> The steel tariff was a obvious play to make steel produced in the states cheaper to steel produced in China. Oh and the tariff was only directed at China, it was a tariff on Chinese steel.Nope, it was first announced as a tariff on all non-NAFTA countries. Then the EU was like: ""Fuck off! We're not the ones dumping steel into you country!"" and we discussed a (temporary) exclusion under the threat of putting tariffs on your products."
dwtm9s2,FMinus1138,"You don't understand a lot of things, not how the world works and even less how NATO works. The US are not the center of the universe, nobody is trying to dictate how you operate, but don't expect everyone to bend over if you trying to bend them over."
dwto6nc,skadefryd,"There's a reason it's called a *trade war*.And just as in a regular war, the winning move is not to play.Everyone knew tariffs were a bad idea. Every economist knows it. Everyone knew our trade partners would react to tariffs with their own tariffs, as is their right. All of Trump's advisers knew it. The only person who didn't is Trump himself.Don't blame China or our allies in Europe. Blame your 62 million countrymen who voted for this idiot."
