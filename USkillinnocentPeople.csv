c9gq3li,daammyy,"""The dangers of overreacting and succumbing to irrational fear are far, far greater than any other dangers posed by these type of events."""
c9gtnth,takumidesh,I think that's the point of terrorism.
c9gwprm,Zenrot,Literally the exact goal of terrorism.
c9gwd11,foslforever,if we really want to be strong Americans; the whole country would have a marathon today and we all run because we are free and not afraid of shit.
c9gwnff,DonewithUsernames,"Americans running. Haha, good one. Maybe if you put Krispy Kreme at the finish line."
c9gznlh,Zidjianisabeast,You know I don't appreciate your tone. I mean we would at least have to have a refreshment bar at the start line. How am I supposed to run without getting my KFC on?
c9gyi83,disitinerant,Please. We only eat Krispy Kreme because it's easier to get to than the mom n pop shop downtown.
c9gzi2m,justjustjust,"Finish line? Hah! We put the donuts on the [courses](http://www.runnersworld.com/races/sugar-rush).Beer and donuts, [too](http://www.bakersdozenbeerrun.com/).Bicycling and donuts, [too](http://thetourdedonut.com/)"
c9h6ydx,Fofolito,I'd run for a Klondike Bar
c9h6lk2,dgtlbliss,"If all Americans ran today, there would be many, many more deaths."
c9h797w,foslforever,Why? are you planning on doing it? I am unafraid and refused to be manipulated by fear mongering because 3 people died in Boston. There are thousands that die in terror attacks like this every single day in the middle east- we live in a free country and the last thing i will do is stay in bed all day afraid to live my life.
c9h7kaf,dgtlbliss,I meant due to heart attacks.
c9hmxv7,foslforever,touche'
c9h0muo,LordPubes,"Americans cower and fear EVERYTHING thus the need of ""muh gunz fer muh rights""."
c9h79wc,foslforever,"i like this angle you are taking, guns didnt protect them this time did it? So lets take away our gun rights, and when bombings happen- we can ask the government for a bomb ban."
c9gt2sf,camlv,Good point. That is the terror in the terror attack
c9gw95k,,"If terrorism produces terror, then it's done it's job - shame the media are so willing to assist it..."
c9guwrx,Sr_DingDong,...*ist*.
c9gupsv,h2sbacteria,"The bread and butter of American foreign and domestic policy are these sorts of events that allow for justification for all sorts of horrors visited upon people in the name of security. Whether that's foreigners that enjoy drone attacks and military interventions (wars)... or citizens who enjoy the effects of losing liberties and being harassed at border checkpoints. To tourists, who too are harassed at border checkpoints. To the economy which suffers from the lack of tourists. Much wisdom is needed and an understanding that we're all in it together. Even the retarded ones who choose to use violence to solve economic and political problems that can be much more effectively solved using peaceful means."
c9h1afi,wenoc,And all this foreign policy is just because the US uses too much gasoline.
c9h5431,h2sbacteria,"It's not just the US, though the US takes the blame for actively using its military. It's the entire world at this point. Oil powers the engines that run the modern economy."
c9hcrxi,wenoc,"Agreed, we use too much oil. But I don't see the entire world invading Iraq. Twice.If the ""liberations"" would be humanitarian there would be several much better targets."
c9gwcif,BrennDreaver,One example of 'horrors' that U.S. is responsible for: car bombs used against U.S. troops. WTF? You know journalism is shit when it can't even put together a coherent argument.
c9gws9q,h2sbacteria,"He is making a point about empathy ... having empathy with other Muslims who go through the same ordeal ... and yes the war in Iraq was without justification started by the US. If it had not been started, then there really would be no terror attacks in Iraq right now. There were no terror attacks in Iraq before the US invasion.The same is not the case in Pakistan where there were terror attacks because of sectarian violence before the US invasion. However, the US invasion and the pressure on the Pakistani army to crack down on militants lead to yet more violence in 2009-2012 killing approximately 40,000 Pakistanis.Point here is that we're all in this together. For better or worse this entire spectre is now shared by all people -- there is no us or them any more."
c9gy6li,,[deleted]
c9h537d,h2sbacteria,"Kurds have a long history of war with Iraq and have been oppressed for much longer than Saddam. In the first war they were able to kill 10,000 Iraqis. And the American response to revolt in Iraq has not been much better than Saddam's response to revolt. If you look at it from the perspective to casualties it's been worse.You can read more about the Kurds in Iraq here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraqi_Kurdistanhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Kurdish_Iraqi_War"
c9hlg05,,[deleted]
c9hlqv5,h2sbacteria,"Yes, what about nuclear weapons such as DU weapons that have caused similar sorts of problems as chemical weapons? And sure some people are less oppressed but if you ask an average Iraqi they will tell you nothing works in their country. But again it's a matter of perspective. Those who were oppressed before are a bit more free and those who were free before are oppressed. And the historical relevance is obviously important because it puts the problems into perspective as to what exactly happened. In the end things could be much better for all Iraqis had the US had a more intelligent foreign policy than it does."
c9gzgr1,zaphdingbatman,"> but you paint way too rosy of a picture of Iraq pre-US invasion.Your comparison paints too rosy of a picture of Iraq post US invasion, in particular your suggestion that it compares favorably to a genocide of 100,000 kurds. Yeah, you pulled that number out of your ass, but I still think it's important to keep in mind just how much destruction we've caused over there.If we were looking to be big damn heros there were MUCH better ways to spend $4T than invading Iraq. Let's not pretend for a second that humanitarian reasons ever entered the decision making process except as an excuse. An excuse that was deemed secondary to the WMD scare which turned out to be entirely fabricated. Humanitarian reasons were literally less important than bullshit when it came to the invasion decision."
c9gu13i,join_or_die,"I agree. However, the same goes for tragedies like Newtown. Bring on the downvotes!"
c9gw2lo,,is it so much succumbing to irrational fear or is to acting out of desperation with what utility you have at hand?
c9gwlg4,rickster907,"Agreed. And now the TSA will make sure we can't bring soda bottles on airline flights for the next 17 years, because rushing to give up our freedom is the FIRST thing we're gonna do to attempt to secure our safety, right? Sad, but true."
c9gx13t,BekkenSlain,"We need more laws and government agencies to restrict our personal liberties!! We need background checks for pressure cookers, common household items, and a ban on marathons!! At the very least we need a much larger and better armored police presents in our streets at all times, watching everything we do with more surveillance equipment and random warrant less public searches of our persons!!! Or the terrorist win :("
c9gvuqc,lolbostonmarathon,Obama is guilty of war crimes and the deaths of hundreds upon hundreds of children in the Middle East.That is a indisputable FACT!But US citizens too busy with big mac and ipad to realize their government is corrupt
c9h147b,Chrisapus,Explain.
c9gv98a,EL_PENIS_FARTO,"The real danger is the threat of when you melt the cheese so to speak. Literally running across the finish line with melted cheese ruining the moment and photo ops failing for dairy due diligence, melted cheese my friends, with your ball bearings and blood, melted cheese."

c9gusxh,,"I loved the post yesterday ""muslims all over the world are praying that the attackers aren't muslim""......lol.....always about themselves! why are they praying for the dead?"
c9gwa6u,Bacon_Donut,No sure? Sarcasm or just dumb?
c9gpnat,Luxray,I feel no rage. Only sadness.
c9grv3p,redditor-for-2-hours,"I feel sadness for every innocent person who is harmed or killed, regardless of where they're from."
c9gtwxj,HilariousMax,"I never really feel anything when stuff like this happens.I understand people lost loved ones and that sucks but it didn't affect me at all.My friend cried. He doesn't know anyone in Boston, nor anyone running the race. For him, the appropriate response was to cry. It's weird for me to see people react in such a way.I love my parents, sister, niece, girlfriend. I will murder you if you fuck with my dog. I love my mates. I like my social acquaintances, my weekly drinking buddies. But I cannot muster these feelings for random people I see on tv, for strangers I'll never meet."
c9gw1sx,forumrabbit,">But I cannot muster these feelings for random people I see on tv, for strangers I'll never meet.Because people die due to injustice by the thousands every day. Wars that don't make the news, poverty (not just overseas), people dying alone in beds. We become desensitised to it."
c9gve1h,renaldo686,"and here I thought I was the only one. Good to know there are other cold hearted assholes in the world, we will be the only ones who survive the zombie apocalypse!"
c9gvv1u,DinosBiggestFan,My experience in DayZ says this is incorrect. You'll be killed by bandits.
c9gvx89,HilariousMax,>...for an empty rifle and a can of beans.
c9gw2d6,DinosBiggestFan,"I would've done just that when I had my night vision scope FAL. But nope, ran through like 15 buildings and through the forest while my body stopped producing blood just looking for ONE thing to eat, raw or cooked. Eventually I fell on conscious and died.Fuck random spawns."
c9gwnx0,waste00,"Every single one of us here is like that. Thousands of people starve to death every week, yet none (or extreeeemly few, like one or two poor souls) shed a single tear over it."
c9gw1ct,Brightt,"> Good to know there are other cold hearted assholes in the worldNo we're not. If anything we're the rational assholes. I give it two weeks and everyone will have forgotten about this. Or at least about their 'sadness' and 'grief'. The only people that will still mourn by then are the ones that were personally affected by it.Remember that tragedy in Sandy Hook everyone felt so bad about? I'll bet you they've by now forgotten how 'bad' they feel and don't spend a minute of their day even thinking about it.We're not assholes, other people are just hypocrites that lie to themselves in order to feel better about themselves for a couple of days (not saying I'm never a hypocrite, but you get the point).To be honest, I feel absolutely no empathy towards your nation at all. I mean, yes, I know people suffered, and I kind of feel bad for the guy that lost his legs, but there is absolutely no sympathy in me for the US as a nation. I don't even feel bad for 9/11. And I'm pretty sure none of my friends give a shit. You guys do it all the time, and then get away with it by saying it's in order to 'help the poor people from being oppressed'. I'm not going to flood you with a wall of text of why I don't feel sympathy, but when the big bully from the playground that keeps punching people finally gets a kick in the dick once, you don't feel bad for him."
c9gwv84,deetofdoom,"It wasn't the Joint Chiefs or some hawkish senators that lost life and limb, it was average citizens. It's clear that you don't agree with US foreign policy, but I don't understand how that translates into this callousness towards human life."
c9gwzjw,Brightt,"It translates into this callousness because from what I've seen on social media and the internet in general, most US citizens are at least equally callous towards human life when it's elsewhere in the world.I'm pretty sure you feel similarly as I do when you hear about yet another bombing somewhere, or the earthquake in Iran (which got completely buried by the Boston bombing by the way). Of course, it's sad that innocent people died, but you're not going to waste your time grieving over people you had absolutely no connection with. Although, one the other hand, I'm pretty sure you don't, because I have a lot of family in Iraq, and although I don't know them on an emotional level, I hold my breath every time I hear about a bombing in Iraq because I'd hate to see my dad lose yet another loved one and having to comfort him for what I believe would be the 16th time in about a year time.Well, add to that that a lot of Americans are also hostile towards the Middle-East and there are actually some that encourage the violent US actions there. That and the fact that all US foreign policies tend to be covered up as much as possible as to not lose face make me have no sympathy towards you as a nation when it comes to tragedy. I know you are not responsible for my callousness, but your government (past and present) is. The fact that these kind of governments keep getting elected though, gives me the impression that many Americans don't want change, and are just blindly following, and are thus indifferent as well. As long as it's not on their precious soil though.Don't you see the hypocrisy in the fact that innocent people get bombed almost daily/weekly across the world by the US, and not a single collective outcry is heard from the US, but when it happens to the US, everyone should damn better feel bad for you, because, heaven forbid, 3 people died. I know that you probably don't agree as a person with the US foreign policy, but I'm also pretty sure you never actively tried to combat it either, even if it was just by protesting/even just trying to put people's minds to it by conversing about it. And even if you do actively 'fight' the atrocities done by the US, for every person like you, there are 50 more that don't give a shit. Hence, I don't tend to care for your country at all, even if it's about innocent lives lost."
c9gyc90,deetofdoom,"I'll admit something which may be a bit taboo on this subreddit, but I'm an interventionist myself. White Man's Burden and all that. Without getting into the whole World Police debate, I'll say it is amazingly easy to fall into that line of thinking as an American. ""We'll help them out, by force if we have to. Give them that push towards the living American Dream."" I believe this is in large part due to how hard it can be to empathise with under developed, strife ridden nations. The poorest country the average American will ever visit (if they even leave the US, only 30% of us have passports) is Mexico, the 11th biggest economy in the world. How could poorer nations not want our help?It is that same unfamiliarity with the world at large that can make us seem uncaring and self centered. Combine that with American Exceptionalism and you end up with something of a petulant nation. However, I'd wager a good deal that if you picked a random American on the street, they would be sympathetic (though likely not empathetic) to the victims of that earthquake, or the bombings in Iraq. It also helps that in our melting pot, chances are you know someone hailing from the afflicted country. As others have said, it's important not to confuse the government for their people. I hold no grudge against the North Korean people, even though their government commits atrocities. I feel saddened when innocents die, regardless of where they are from. If you can't get the empathy flowing for the victims of the bombings and the nation sharing their grief, I think it would be good to strive for sympathy."
c9gw340,renaldo686,and now you lost me...
c9gw4xe,Brightt,At what part did I lose you?
c9gwssn,yugoslavic,I completely agree with you and the thinking. It's hard for Americans to understand there's 6.7 billion people more in the world. My point is they can't think outside the box since they live in the box. A few can understand the viewpoint of someone from Europe on the United States. The fact that so many lives are lost everyday to similar situations and no Americans are praying and feeling sad is proof. I get the impression that only American lives are valuable and worth discussing and mourning. The rest of the world isn't as important. This personality trait of the nation as a whole is another reason adding to the increasing numbers of negative thinking individuals about the United States.
c9gvss7,bowbenpb,"Not that you said there is, but there's nothing wrong with your response to the attack. Everyone reacts in their own way.You probably already know this, but the difference between you and your upset friend is the degree to which you empathize with those in Boston. Sympathy is feeling sorry for someone else's situation and understanding why they feel a certain way, which I take it is what you feel. Empathy is the ability to feel what they're feeling--or at least approximate it.It has its advantages and disadvantages, like most things in life. It's a great attribute for relating to people, but it could definitely interfere with normal life if you empathize too strongly."
c9gx2he,Calgetorix,You also can't possibly feel truly sorry for every bad thing that happens in the world. It would be too overwhelming. I guess you automatically filter away some things.
c9gvqom,peer_gynt,"Interesting -- I know many people who feel like you (or, rather don't in this context), but just as many who see every human being as their next-of-kin (as I do), and I am sure that this is a gradual scale, so there are all shades in between. I wonder where that difference comes from -- but I am quite sure that more empathy would make the world a gentler(*) place. (*) tried hard to avoid the phrase 'better place', as I think the judgement is out on that..."
c9gwm0u,turktransork,">but just as many who see every human being as their next-of-kin (as I do)*Every* human? Or just the one's from your country? Because if you really feel like this about *every* human it is a wonder that you can ever get out of bed. Either that, or you don't feel a lot of pain at the death of your next of kin. I'm not trying to be a dick here, it just seems implausible to me that this can really be true and far more likely that you feel this way either only about those you associate yourself with or perhaps only those whose suffering you are inadvertently exposed to."
c9gy3aw,peer_gynt,"> *Every* human? ... or you don't feel a lot of pain ...Well, it is hard to scale feelings, isn't it? So, what can I say... I think you need indeed some amount of understanding (you say association) to feel empathy - I was brought up in an environment where that was very important, and that does not stop with people you sympathize with. Let me put is this way: have you ever heard someone say that he/she himself/herself [1] is evil? 'bad', yes, which often pairs with low self esteem, or fear, in particular in children -- but evil? I don't think so. I believe that every person actually tries to do as best as he/she can to do good -- it is only that circumstances, education, believes lead to very different and contradictory meanings of 'good'. Since that point, I *do* feel emphatic for any person, and lament the times and cirumstances, and our limited ability to communicate and to think, which lead to tragedies... Sounds lofty, I know, but it isn't meant to be -- don't know how to put it in simpler words though...To answer more directly though: death of my grandma hurts more than, say, the death of Osama Bin Ladin. Oh, very much more so... Who do I pity more? Osama... My grandma had a long live, and lived it fully, she was happy to live to see her great-grand children. Osama was hated by half, or even most, of mankind. How did he get there? By trying to do good for his people, and yes, I *do* believe that to be true...[1] sorry, non-native speaker..."
c9gvoux,sammanzhi,"Exactly. A certain level of empathy is what you're going to feel. Ah, damn I hate that people have to suffer. I hate that people got bombed and I feel for the families that were hurt in the fallout. But it's no where near the emotional connection I feel towards my loved ones. It's not a personal emotional connection and it's hard to stretch empathy into emotional distress."
c9gvfqb,SolarMoth,"Even if it sounds distasteful, I feel the same way. I don't know these people on an emotional level. I can comprehend how horrendous the experience was and what effects a tragedy can have on people, but I don't know, I just think crying or being distressed is overreacting."
c9gvmlf,wiz_witout,"I don't see how its overreacting. Maybe I am just overly empathetic but I find it perfectly normal to shed a few tears when something like this happens. Its always a sentence or two in an article or a picture that hits it home for me. Not usually a gruesome detail, but a small thing that really shows the grief those affected are feeling. It hits me, and I get sad, and then I realize that what I am feeling behind a computer isn't even a fraction of what the people who lived through it are feeling, and I get even sadder."
c9h1h41,wildgreengirl,"I usually don't feel too sad hearing about it, but the little things do get to me. Like the photo of the father over his 8 yr old daughters body at the race."
c9h0wj2,,[deleted]
c9h1x7h,wiz_witout,"Haha usually not. Empathy is a funny thing. You can try to learn it, but sometimes you have little control over what strikes you. Its hard for me to empathize with people in the Middle East, or Asia or Africa. I would like to but their lives are so vastly different than mine. That's why I try and read news and educate myself, so that I can do my best to understand what people are going through and make informed decisions. I think I saw a great TED talk about the importance of empathy once that really stuck with me."
c9gvx5y,takeitu,"totally understand your point of view but people who cry or really sympathize with the victims are not over reacting, just coz you don't understand their feelings doesn't mean you should dismiss them."
c9gvwwb,IssacStanley,"I'm the same, I've justified it in my head as it'd be insulting to the victims if I, as someone who wasn't affected in the slightest, were to cry at the events.I'm fully aware that people like to show solitary in times of crisis but my brain just doesn't make those emotional connections. Maybe I'm just selfish?"
c9gwbnq,Arktodus,"You're not selfish at all, you simply see crying people on TV, read about them in the newspapers or sites and because of that, you think that is normal. It's not.The news always show's something out of the ordinary. You don't sell adds if your program asks normal people who don't feel emotional and who don't want to be bothered."
c9gwhlx,_Holic_,"I was raised in a doomsady cult with many failed prophecys of the end coming. Taugh that in ""the glorious day of jehovah"" 6 BILLION people would be killed. That they were to be viewed as cockroaches inhabiting a house, and their deaths cleansed the earth. I left that cult but still feel as you do when this kind of thing happens, same with 9/11. Interesting but that is all.I give this info because I am curious as to what made you this way. I realize that something that doesn't effect you or anyone you know should NOT ellict emotion. Yet in most people it does. You and and I are cousins in this reguard. As part of my upbring vs envrnment self study I wonder what makes you feel this way."
c9gwhmz,,Give it time grasshopper.
c9gwmau,magmabrew,Go look at the pictures of the guy in the wheelchair with his leg blown off and all you see is his fucking femur sticking out 2 feet below where his flesh ends and tell me you feel nothing.
c9gwngk,sedateeddie420,"I think if we, as a species, really felt sadness when stuff like this happened, as supposed to mild shock and morbid fascination, there wouldn't be so much war. It is only natural you don't really care. I mean, whenever I see news of a bombing in Iraq I literally can't be bothered to read about it...*de-sensitised much*. The only reason I follow the news about the Boston bombings if for it's novelty value, I think."
c9gxczp,katsujinken,I was exactly like you until I became a father. Now I can't even watch the news anymore.
c9gxws0,NihilisticToad,I'm going to hazard a guess and say you're in your teens?
c9h196l,redditor-for-2-hours,"I don't understand people who cry who didn't know anyone involved either, that seems like a bit of an overdramatic reaction. I just feel bad for mankind that things like this are still going on."
c9h2nch,Travis47,Sympathy is one thing but empathy never really happens to me in these situations.
c9h53q2,TheResPublica,The only way to stop all bad things from happening in the world is for it to cease to exist.
c9gvomo,NotSoBuffGuy,People think im weird cause i think the exact same way
c9gvp4y,bazsick,"I feel the same way. I fear it's a sort of desensitizing through society probably because information and media are so readily available through the internet. Let's just say through my years of journeying the world wide web, I've seen some shit. Not to mention this happens in other countries frequently in comparison to the U.S."
c9gvvc2,throwawaypayhelp,"Not to be rude, but the problem I see is that you (and all the others that posted below in accordance) are being a little bit self-centered. If you take a look at your statement and many others you'll a lot of ""I"" and ""me"". The issue is that this isn't about you, it's about the victims and the entire existence of the issue. If you'd like to empathize a bit more try imaging the situation happening not directly to you but to someone very close to you. Think of your father/mother, or brother/sister. They are running a marathon, something they've been talking about for a while, they have been putting a decent amount of effort into preparing, eating right, running more often. They are excited and you are excited for them, it's something they really enjoy. So you go on about your day and you're at work when you see the first news report or hear the first person talk about the incident. ""Oh my god"" you think, ""My mother was running in that race."" So now you're reading about it and its a few explosions but all centered mostly around a single time so your mom is *probably* alright... but you can't get in touch with her. You're calling, and calling, but still remaining mostly calm. You go on the google website, the other websites, her name is not registered anywhere. No one else has been able to get in touch with her either. Everyone is worried now and fearing the worst, texting and calling eachother. Then you feel it. Right in your heart, you feel the emptyness, the hurt, the hole. Your mother is gone. Maybe you saw it on a website, maybe it was a text or a phone call. Maybe you came across a random picture on the internet. It doesn't matter, your mother is dead. This morning she went to the Boston marathonin the best and brightest of spirits, this afternoon she is gone forever. You will never get to say goodbye, you will never see her or hear from here again. You maybe have a voicemail you can call to hear her voice. The trick to feeling on the issue is to put yourself in their shoes, think of the reality of the situation they are in, the depth and intricacy. Stop thinking of how it doesn't relate to you.This does not only apply to the Boston marathon."
c9gw2il,SolarMoth,"There is no value in my empathy. I see no reason to get stressed over something that I couldn't control. This event did not effect me personally. I don't see the need to feel what these people are feeling besides simply seeming ""kind."" If this situation were to effect someone I am emotionally connected to, whether its family or a friend of a friend, it may be another story."
c9gw52i,HilariousMax,"I'm not trying to be dismissive of your post but I feel I addressed this in the last bit of my post. I'm emotionally invested in my family/friends so of course I'd be upset if something happened to them. The issue isn't that I can't feel or that I can but won't.I understand that it's a shitty situation. I understand their loss, their pain (to a degree). I simply don't feel it on an emotional level."
c9gw1zz,dioxholster,Really? I know Arabs who wish to see America wiped off the map feel sadness about what happened.
c9gtbyz,Blasphemic_Porky,I was a bit shocked on how the Boston thing was on top while what happened in Iran had 46 deaths and 300 injured. Don't get me wrong both are atrocious... but both deserve attention. Both need help.
c9gtuvf,moggt,"I thought it was Iraq, not Iran?"
c9gu0o9,MagmaiKH,Iran had a 7.8 earthquake.
c9gu78k,,"It's awful, but because of the way the media works (or I guess the way it affects me) the Boston tragedy seems much worse. Its the whole attitude of ""yeah, but people die in the Middle East all the time, right?"" I know its wrong on my part, but its the first thing that comes to mind."
c9guptu,Scenro,"The handful of people dead would be as bad as a tragedy as a terrible bus crash, the injured is a bit unnerving, but the critical toll of the event doesn't seem as big as much else that could happen, and the rest of the world probably hardly cares or knows much of the event, having more troubling matters to attend to."
c9gyxfg,fishguy2001,"As a member of the ""rest of the world"" I care as much as I would about any horrible tragedy anywhere with this number of terrible casualties. However, I care far more because your country has a chronic history of lashing out blindly and/or maliciously after an event like this. Given America's relative ability to visit violence I feel a bit like we are a group of folks trapped in a one room apartment with a maddened grizzly bear."
c9gw0gv,Galious,"If your neighbour has a deadly car accident in front of your house, it's a major event and news for you. If it happens in the other side of your city with people you don't know, it's minor news but you can empathize a bit with the situation since you've been there once or twice and can have a virtual picture of what happened.If it happens on the other side of the world, it's not a news. It's just a part of statistic.This is not being inhuman but just that it's impossible for the human brain to feel sorry for the ~1,8 people dying every second in the world."
c9gw307,dioxholster,In Australia they got Boston bombing 24/7 coverage with breaking updates on all channels. No mention of Iraq or Iran. Also press conferences by aussie politicians expressing sadness.
c9gvtkr,MrsJingo,"I think he meant Iraq, Iran was in the news yesterday in the uk. Iran had an earthquake. The bombings in Iraq were glossed over by the media though. If he meant Iran his death and injury stat is way off."
c9gucpc,Blasphemic_Porky,I know. That is where I am stuck.
c9guyjp,RideBmx11,Then get un-stuck.
c9gv63j,Blasphemic_Porky,Haha. Good advice :)
c9gw2l8,dioxholster,It's not that its because American lives are worth more thats what happens when you are a superpower.

c9gwk8f,A_Sinclaire,"I guess the attention is only one side, the OP is talking about the emotions involved though.Look at the comments on news articles actually covering the earthquake, for example on CNN.com. There is a lot of hatred, especially from US contributors saying the people there deserved to die etc. Its not just not caring, but actually welcoming such events as long as ""the others"" are affected. Of course its only a minority that thinks and acts like that.. as as is often the case.. .the angriest people are the loudest."
c9gvshe,MrsJingo,Did you mean Iraq or Iran? One had a violent man-made incident the other had an earthquake.. From the death toll I believe you mean Iraq not Iran. This is causing some confusion for people.
c9h0sme,Blasphemic_Porky,Yes I think it was Iraq. It was whatever those numbers were. Was it the earthquake or attack?
c9h2w8z,MrsJingo,"Iran was the earthquake, Iraq was the attack. There were a similar number of deaths in both but half the number of injured in Iran."

c9grczq,syndicated_writer,"> I do not believe the US purposefully targets innocent people, and find the title ignorant.We don't intentionally target innocent people but we sure kill a lot of them. What generates the anger is when out of control contractors slaughter dozens of people and never face justice for it. When American soldiers go on a rampage, killing dozens of unarmed civilians and the one guy who gets charged, gets off. And the news is full of images of people supporting him. That's where the outrage comes from, not the occasional stray laser guided bomb, although that doesn't help."
c9gt0hg,samsdayfuss,"Actually, we have straight up targeted the funerals of suspected terrorists because we suspect that there might be more suspected terrorists there. We do this knowing innocent women, children, and babies are there. It isn't even a secret anymore."
c9gwtwr,YouBWrong,"And terrorists do go to those funerals thinking they will be safe if they hide behind women, children and babies. Terrorists that if allowed to continue living, will intentionally kill women children and babies (and do every day in Afghanistan and Iraq)."
c9gwzub,MonkeydRuffy,lets just kill every human being on earth because of some terrorists.
c9gx7x3,YouBWrong,You are being disingenuous.
c9gzatf,MrBooks,Isn't that the exact same logic used by terrorists to justify attacks on civilians?
c9gzf00,YouBWrong,"Nope. Terrorists don't claim to be trying to get military targets. Terrorists concentrate on civilian targets (like Boston). They can't win a conventional war so they resort to drumming up terror in their opposition and support with people who will see dead children as some kind of a victory for their side. What the United States does also results in dead children, but that is not the intent. It may, arguably, be the intent of the terrorists to force us into making these kinds of decisions where the only way we can get them is with a lot of dead innocents."
c9gzsev,MrBooks,So you are saying it is OK to blow up children if you are trying to get at you enemies?
c9h00dp,YouBWrong,"I just read over everything that I wrote and I don't see anything that could be interpreted to mean that. If you're looking for someone who thinks that, I suggest you find a member of Al Qaeda or maybe Anders Brevik. To restate, the difference between what the United States is doing, and what terrorists do is that the innocents that they kill are exactly what they are trying to do. When the United States does it, it is by accident and does not further our goals."
c9h4lyo,MrBooks,"I fail to see how it can be accidental... deliberately bombing an area, knowing full well that there are civilians present, makes those civilian deaths intentional"

A three month investigation including eye witness reports has found evidence that at least 50 civilians were killed in follow-up strikes when they had gone to help victims. More than 20 civilians have also been attacked in deliberate strikes on funerals and mourners. The tactics have been condemned by leading legal experts.Here's another [report](http://web.law.columbia.edu/human-rights-institute/counterterrorism/drone-strikes) from Columbia Law School that reaches many of the same conclusions.

c9h34x5,tharacecard,"Not 'their side', independent researchers. Also, rationalize all you want but the fact remains that our government is blowing up people, including 60 children, from the sky in our name and then calling them enemy combatants after the fact without bothering to complete even the most cursory investigation to determine if they've actually done anything. Read the reports or stay in the dark and keep justifying it to yourself. Whatevs."
c9haune,patsnsox,"I will continue to trust a govt accountable to the people over religious extremists who hide behind women and children. We are all aware innocents get killed.

If they don't apparently care about their families well being, why should we? Of course we should do everything we can to stop innocents dying, but they do make it very difficult at times."
c9guhfa,samsdayfuss,"I'm really confused by what you just wrote.You understand what a funeral is, right? Where people go to mourn the dead. They aren't using their families as meat shields, they are spending time with them. These are people. They live with eachother.In many cases they are fighting because they believe they are protecting their families.And no, we don't do everything we can to stop innocents from dying. I don't know why you think that, but our drone program has a 50 to 1 innocent to target ratio, and the targets aren't even given trials. Legally, every person a drone kills is innocent. If we really cared about innocent people, we would shut down that program."
c9gvpck,dingoperson,">I don't know why you think that, but our drone program has a 50 to 1 innocent to target ratio,Source?According to the numbers from this: http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/02/04/obama-terror-drones-cia-tactics-in-pakistan-include-targeting-rescuers-and-funerals/260 attacks under Obama, between 280 and 535 civilians confirmed killed. If we go with the higher number, that means 2 civilian deaths per drone strike.If we go with your 50 to 1 ratio, that means only 1 in 25 drone strikes hits the intended target.Something seems quite unlikely."
c9gwjtb,,Take into account that the us redefined its civilian definition. Now any male within the age range of 15-40 is considered an enemy combatant. Thats alot of people right there not being counted anymore.
c9gx15t,,"You do understand I was talking about when they hide in houses with women and children, or go to events asides from funerals, right? You do realise it doesn't make you right because you can nitpick one event, right?"
c9hkpaq,samsdayfuss,"Once again I'm baffled. This isn't one event. It has happened multiple times.They aren't hiding in houses hoping we don't kill them because they are surrounded with their families. They are living in their homes. These are people. Even if they were intentionally hiding behind their families as meat shields, that still wouldn't make it OK for us to just bomb them anyway. It's pretty hard to not hit innocent people when we launch bombs from the sky on their cities. They aren't living in huts. They have communities filled with people. Drone bombing is the most care-less tactic I can think of to murder suspected targets."
c9guyk4,seriousbob,So are they to judge themselves deserving of a swift death and simply report to the nearest US execution drone?
c9gx1cm,,"Well, it should certainly make people who want to join think twice. Or are you one of these people who thinks all extremists must surely have lost a family member or something?"
c9hkfjr,seriousbob,"Why do you think people become terrorists? You gave one explanation, that they've suffered personal losses. Do you think they will think twice in that case?What other reasons do you think people have to engage in what you deem as terrorism? Do you think any of those reasons are actually impacted by the threat of getting killed by the US?How do you yourself react to threats, like say 9/11. Did you feel as if you wanted to give up? Surrender? After all you might die in the next attack. Or did you want revenge, even though you personally wasn't affected by it?"
c9hmigk,,"I don't seek out meaningless revenge, I just wanted our countries to take steps to use their power to prevent it. In the absence of that, I would probably just feel resentment.Most studies indicate that terrorists don't come from these families affected by the US. You mention 9/11. Was it poor, brutalised, uneducated people? No. It was wealthy Saudis with degrees."
c9hn0hf,seriousbob,And they willingly flew into their death. Doesn't seem as if that was a big deterrent to them. Why do you think they did it?Would drones have prevented 9/11?
c9hno5p,,I dare say drones have prevented countless terrorist attacks.
c9ho7mb,seriousbob,"I asked specifically about 9/11. You also ignored the first part of my post. Related, do you think those planes should have been shut down? Even more related, where do you think a person such as yourself, living in iraq, would turn to have someone 'take steps to use their power to prevent it'. Who should they contact to stop bombs falling over their land?"
c9ho8ni,,"Do I think if we were targeting high level operatives and leaders in Al Qaeda 9/11 would have happened? What do you think Einstein? Do I think the planes that were hijacked should have been shut down, or shot down? Obviously they should have been taken out of the air. I know full well that the people in these countries have little recourse, but that's because their aims are religious and political, rather than your over simplified idea that they just want revenge."
c9ho9zz,seriousbob,I'd prefer if you weren't rude. Shot down. Again you ascribe opinions to me that you feel are easier to argue against. In which way are their motivations - regardless of what they may be - different from yours?
c9gukya,NotaManMohanSingh,"Your...ignorance is stupefying. Targeting a funeral is not since. Civilised people do not do it. Even the Mafia had a code around but targeting funerals.Also attending a funeral /= hiding in the ""harem"""
c9gvqn9,anticonventionalwisd,"Yup, as MLK said, the US is ""the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today. A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death,"" spoken two days before he was shot dead."
c9gx0yq,,Why focus on that one aspect where you are right... They've hit a funeral a tiny handful of times out of thousands of strikes.
c9gx790,NotaManMohanSingh,"That was one example. And even if it was done 10 times in 10 years, an pretty sure, the 500 odd innocent civilians who died, strongly object to your view point.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mobileweb/robert-greenwald/us-drone-strikes-are-caus_b_2224627.htmlLink has a link to a YouTube video, am sure the the 176 ""terrorist"" children killed in drone attacks would like to have a word with you if possible.But...but, they are ""collateral damage"" you would say, the price they pay for their freedom you would say...I say to you, that what happened in Boston is cold blooded murder, and what the US does in Pakistsn, Iraq, Yemen etc is also cold blooded, systematic murder."
c9gxi0i,,"If the extremists were targeting political figures and harming children in the process, I would call that collateral damage too. But they are deliberately targeting civilians. You are comparing apples to oranges."
c9gtxbc,Secret4gentMan,if someone accidentally killed your family or members of your family... how much do you think you'd care about whether it were an accident or not?
c9guhfn,,"It's not an occasional stray bomb. We have killed tens of thousands of people in Afghanistan and Pakistan in air strikes. TENS OF THOUSANDS. There were never thousands of terrorists, we're out killing 24 year old platoon and company sized leaders in the Taliban, and knowingly killing their families and neighbors in the process."
c9gy4qi,Krazy19Karl,"According to [Costs of War,](http://costsofwar.org/article/afghan-civilians) 16,700 to 19,000 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan in 12 years. According to a UN report of the recent years, the Taliban were responsible for 76% of civilian casualties in 2009, 75% in 2010, and 80% in 2011. [According to wikipedia,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_attacks_in_Pakistan) between 1,969 and 3,461 people (total militants + civilians) have been killed in Pakistan by drone strikes. This doesn't add up to tens of thousands. This adds up to more like 5,000 to 6,000 over the course of 12 years of war."
c9h0lc0,,"Oh, well that's totally fine then isn't it?"
c9h2fh1,Krazy19Karl,"Your figure was many factors off. When claims aren't fact checked, they become de facto facts.About 400-500 in one year. That's approximately equal to the number of people who die falling out of bed per year. Or about 20 minutes of world war ii. Or about 1.4 days of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. If you want to publicize your opposition to the war, go ahead. But don't let truthiness get in the way of the actual facts and figures."
c9hf3or,,"Ironic that you would criticize my math with a phrase that is meaningless. What is a ""factor off,"" hmm?"
c9hgy1t,Krazy19Karl,"You didn't specify an exact number of people killed, you merely threw out a vague scale, ""tens of thousands."" I couldn't get very specific and say ""off by a factor of ten"" or ""off by a factor of 5"" when pointing out that your magnitude did not match with reality."
c9gusnj,IvanStroganov,also the occasional stray laser guided bombs add up
c9gwtko,YouBWrong,"I hear you, and there is definitely room for improvement, but lets not forget that there is plenty of fault to go around here. Defeating the Taliban was a noble goal. The motives for defeating them were, as foreign relation goals for any country go, relatively selfless. The fact that those assholes like to hole up in houses full of innocents, and that the people who let them do so have not realized that they are being used as human shields is often ignored.But I'll tell you this much. If an American soldier kills dozens of unarmed civilians, he's in a lot more trouble than when a Taliban soldier does it."
c9gu2mo,dingoperson,">We don't intentionally target innocent people but we sure kill a lot of them.But the title is still wrong, at least in my case - because I **know** that if the Boston bombings had instead been of a military parade where bystanders were killed as well, then my own feelings would have been quite different."
c9guom2,NotaManMohanSingh,"So riddle me this, 50 people going about their daily lives, shopping, driving around, dropping kids at school.One bad guy (no trial, no jury, he has been deemed a bad guy buy an agency that has a known history of cock up's.To take out one ""bad guy"", 50 innocent civilians pay the ultimate price...How is it any different from the Boston bombings...maybe the terror outfits were trying to take out the policemen on duty, and the others were collateral damage?I am not in any way condoning the bombing, as an Indian, I have been exposed to such horrific acts, and my full sympathies with the victims, but the Us, and to a large extent its people have massive double standards and that is the truth."
c9gu6tn,,"No, you don't know.Because you wouldn't have had a baseline to compare that event to. Like the bombing of Pearl Harbour wasn't acceptable to the public at that time."
c9gv29r,dingoperson,"What the hell? Sorry, I know my feelings well enough to say that with certainty, after having considered my feelings regarding a huge variety of attacks over time. For example, I have already lived through a highly detailed (no shit, because it's myself) assessment of my reactions to the Ft Hood shootings, and it's not that hard to consider how that would have been different had a visiting civilian come between the gunman and targeted soldiers. Your rationale that I couldn't have is difficult to understand, but undeniably wrong."
c9gv5as,,"It's not personal.But no, you don't know how you would have felt if this hadn't happened the way it happened first. That's how our emotions work.You can grade your levels of emotional response because you have the original incident as a baseline. If it had never happened, you would have no idea how much value you place on a similar but different incident.I raised Pearl harbour as an example. If what you said was true, the public outcry of the attack on Pearl Harbour would be considerately more muted."
c9gvgj6,dingoperson,"From me it is semi-personal. It's not personal in that I want to know you or care about you as an individual. But it is personal in that the mindset, thought processes and rationales (the inner personal toolkit of how the world is considered) of someone saying what you do must come from a very dysfunctional kind of person. In that sense it's person-al, because the person is the source of the wrongness.As already stated I have gone through the feelings of a very great many situations where military and civilians die in attacks. Based on these I am able to extrapolate a very rough approximation of what my feelings would have been for several different types of plausible terrorist attacks. Is Boston the first attack against Western-world civilians? Absolutely not. Having sat through 9/11, the Madrid and London bombings, the Unabomber, WTC, letter bombs, anarchist bombings and plenty of others I have seen attacks against civilians.If instead a military presence in Boston had been targeted - would that be the first attack against a military target with civilian casualties? Absolutely not. Drone strikes, the bombings of Serbia and Libya, attacks during WW2, there's a great selection to take from.Is it possible to precisely extrapolate feelings like that? Absolutely not. Is it possible to roughly do so? Yes. And that lets me know that these rough areas of potential reactions would be quite different. Your assertion that I would ""have no idea"" is hence blatantly false, because I would have ""some idea"" based on other experiences.You raise Pearl Harbour again. It's difficult to understand why, since it's my emotions we're talking about here. Why repeat Pearl Harbour in two posts when it's not very relevant at all?Consider this: Let's say Adam says he doesn't want to eat a big hamburger because he knows how he will end up feeling if he does. Bob then insists that Adam SIMPLY CAN NOT KNOW THIS. How would we describe Bob? Eh, probably not in the most glowing terms."

If history is any example the United States Government will lie to the American public and will act using force unilaterally against individuals, groups or nations that they can't bend to their own will.

c9h0t6x,EnergyCritic,"Apparently he knows the word ""terrorist"". Terrorism is a part of US history. :P"
c9h2bd6,Thebluecane,Well I guess it was too much to ask for a non bash the US circle jerk. BTW I was a history major before I switched to engineering so yeah I know my history. But it does show your level of education to resort to personal attacks based on nationality.
c9h2d97,un_aguila_por_favor,"Maybe, or maybe there was a reason you switched. Don't worry about my education, I'm doing alright."
c9h2ij6,Thebluecane,The reason I switched was because I its hard to find a good paying job in the US with a liberal arts degree. Also you can be as educated as you want but judging people based on a national identity is about as educated as racism
c9h2ou4,un_aguila_por_favor,"I travelled a lot in recent times and some of the best people I met were americans, some of the worst too.Lets face it, most americans have no idea about the suffering their government caused. Heck, even the way you worded your points make me doubt the extent of your knowledge of the american history. I don't hate all americans, not even close. I had amazing discussion on reddit with american historians on old accounts, I bought half a dozen books and read about 3000 pages as a result."
c9h2tgm,Thebluecane,Man your comment reminds me of something I saw on the news. The accused a guy of being racist and his proof he wasn't was that he had loads of black friends
c9h2wnr,un_aguila_por_favor,"Label me racist, I don't care. My soon-to-be-born son is half-american, but obviously that only happened to distract from my anti-american racism (even though ""american"" is no race).As someone who studied history you should know how between 20 and 30 million died as a result of american interventions since WW2. That and a mostly indifferent population towards those events is my problem."
c9h3db4,Thebluecane,"And how many died as a result of colonialism back in the day. Huh where are you tears for them. Also I didn't say America was a race I was just using the comparison because it was fitting since you felt comfortable stereotyping an entire nation in you first comment. Anyway whats your basis for an ""indifferent population"" we have protests against violence and war constantly is it that every single American needs to do penance of some type. This holier than thou argument is bullshit and doesn't do anything but stroke the egos of non-Americans with under false pretenses."
c9h3hxa,un_aguila_por_favor,"Millions too, it's considerably longer ago, though.Of course you have demonstrations, you are hundreds of millions, and there are undoubtably many good ones amongst them. When I see certain american polls I'm losing all hope for a better future, that's how it is."
c9h3jma,Thebluecane,"What polls are you referring to anyway that have you ""losing all hope for a better future""?"
c9h3mh9,un_aguila_por_favor,"For example, 70% support behind Guantanamo, and majority behind drone strikes.The reason why I'm so concerned is because I believe that if the US doesn't act morally, no big nation will. And that could be the end of the road for humanity as we know within 2-5 decades."
c9h0r8k,EnergyCritic,You must be overflowing with money considering how right you are all the time.
c9gwsii,YouBWrong,"With all due respect, I think that you're reading things into what was written that simply were not there. There is a difference between ""I do not believe the US purposefully targets innocent people"" and ""implicitly trusting the United States Government"".You may be right about the U.S. Government lying to the American public. All governments lie. Specifically the U.S. Government might be lying about the conduct of its drone program, but for me to even begin theorizing about them targeting innocents I'd need to see a motive. What do you think the U.S. has to gain by purposely killing non-combatants?"
c9h17s5,,>What do you think the U.S. has to gain by purposely killing non-combatants?I've never once said that they target civilians intentionally.
c9h1i7c,YouBWrong,Well then what is your issue? The government admits to killing civilians accidentally and you wrote three paragraphs accusing them of lying.
c9gvfjc,Dojodog,"I am a liberal who hates a ton of what we have done in the middle east, but over generalizations like yours I feel are equally as destructive as the Right's insistence that all muslims hate us for our freedoms.America has ton of blood on its hands. Some of it innocent blood, and some of it from people who never would have fought us if not for ""collateral damage"". But most or at least a large percentage of that blood is from people who have used words and more importantly actions to prove that they see no problem blowing up anyone or anything to make a point. If a cop busts your window to move your vehicle from a fire lane you can't compare that to a burglar doing it to steal your car. Yes you have busted window from both, but intentions matter."
c9gw5zy,ine8181,"I think analogising a human life to a busted window is dangerous and wrong. If a cop busted in and shot your father, mother, brother or sister, I think it'll be much harder to forgive them because 'intentions matter'.It's not, in my opinion, 'generalising', as you put it, but rather the matter of finding a pattern in the foreign policy of the U.S. The U.S. have been doing the same thing (namely, wantonly disregarding innocent lives) over and over, over the decades, and they haven't stopped or slowed down. I recommend 'Understanding Power' (Chomsky) or the 'Trial of Henry Kissenger' (Hitchens)."
c9gx1p1,Dojodog,"I don't even think Chomsky would agree with the place that slipway takes the debate. I would however say that if my father blew up a coffee shop full of tourists. Then cops kicked in the door and shot him, my mom and my cousin it would be different than if a random thug broke in and did the same thing. I am not an apologist for American foreign policy. We have probably been one of the worst actors in world affairs over the last 40 years. However, we've also been one of the best. Those two realities can exist simultaneously.Piracy has existed since people had boats. Over the last 30 years thanks almost entirely to American Naval supremacy, it is virtually extinct. That trade helps everyone. Lives and money saved. Trade made cheap. Germany and Japan were conquered enemies who were protected from the Soviet Union, North Korea and China from retribution after the war. Vietnam was full of darkness but the democratic people in the south liked us and wanted our help. I am NOT rationalizing it all away, but if anyone tries to say ""we're completely to blame. Its all us. We are ONLY the bad guys"" they are either ignorant of the facts or willfully choosing to ignore them."
c9gzm0l,ine8181,"Interesting. Do you have source for the US Navy's effects on piracy?Also, I don't agree (personal opinion, I guess) with your analogy. I don't think it'll be any easier to forgive an entity with basically infinitely greater capacity for intelligence and violence to commit wanton destruction upon my family, the destruction many times greater than the original harm caused, no matter what the 'intention'.At some point, people and governments need to be judged on their actions, not intentions, stated or implied.Also, I think ""the U.S. is the only bad guy"" is a strawman."
c9h73u2,Dojodog,"I can not break intent from action. Its the difference between manslaughter and homicide. It seems though that we are at least in basic agreement. I was arguing the idea that America ""is solely selfish and a completely bad actor, to blame entirely for the ill will of the Middle East"""
c9gwkcj,,"This analogy would work if we assumed that the ""cop"" was acting in good faith, but every piece of evidence we have based on recent history proves that the United States does NOT act in good faith, but only in self-interest."
c9h7tbt,Dojodog,"Every single? I am sorry but even if the evidence is 90%/10% for America being bad, it still makes your argument invalid."
c9gwyz2,Dojodog,Thank you for that response. I now know I am either dealing with an irrational zealot who ignores facts or a serial exaggerator.

An organization that is known for drawing incorrect conclusions based on bad intelligence and has been caught lying and fabricating evidence tells us their definition of an ""enemy"" is anyone that, based on their intelligence, is near an enemy compound.

Other cities like Kyoto were given a pass in favor of these two cities because these two heavily contributed to the war effort. The factories where they build planes that they are then going to use to sink our ships, for example, are fair game IMO. Also, the Japanese were warned about the atomic bomb and had opportunity to surrender. The military personnel running the country refused, and probably wouldn't have surrendered until the country was in ashes, whether it was atomic bombs or a ground campaign. Those people fooled the Japanese public into continuing to support a war which by that point they had no chance of winning, and are the real people to blame for the continued loss of Japanese lives. They also needed to be stopped from continuing the absolute rape of all the other nations in the region. Finally I don't think the title was even referring to that, since Japan is not one of those countries that harbors rage toward the US. The relationship between the two countries is very good now.

c9gws46,turktransork,"Neither were necessary. With control of the air and the sea Japan wouldn't have been able to hold out for long under a blockade. The only problem with a slow, relatively painless end to the war like that is that the allies would have ended up only with a conditional surrender rather than an unconditional one. Big deal. The Japanese had already offered conditional surrender under the terms that the US eventually imposed (i.e. preservation of the status of the Emperor) and been turned down. The choice between the bomb and invasion only arises if you insist to begin with on showing how big your dick is and forcing your opponent to suck it."
c9gx166,,"We could have waited, but another point to the atomic bombs as you said was a dick showing moment. It was a sign too the entire world enemies and allies, too expect this when at war with the US. This action most likely deterred many future wars against the US. The MAD system has been a deterrent of war between super powers. The likelyhood of a war between the US,Russia,and China are very slim now.

They could have used the exact same argument, that they were ending the war immediately, and saving more lives in the long run by preventing the long grind of continued fighting and invasion.If we accept atrocities from ourselves that we would never countenance from our enemies we are not very principled."
c9h73yy,,I never said i would not accept their reasoning.I detest nuclear weapons and wished we could eliminate them from the world.

c9gtb6d,,"And it is still completely different because that was an act of war, perpetrated by one government against another nation they were warring against (and which actually started the war, after invading and raping several other countries) which gives more legitimacy to the actions. Japan and US were engaged in total war, it is very different from a terrorist bombing."
c9gtue3,sabrohammer,"None of the conventional wisdoms you spout are supported by any facts. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki directly targeted population centers, as even Hiroshima was struck in the center of the city (while most major factories were on the periphery of the city. If that's not terrorism, I don't know what is. Even Eisenhower and MacArthur saw this for the barbarism that it was. Do they, too, suffer from historical illiteracy? If the ends justify the means, then what unimaginable atrocities are not justified? Killing women and children by the hundreds of thousands just to break the will of the people is as morally repugnant as it gets.As cited in the link below, the Allies' insistence on unconditional surrender is what dragged the war on for so long. What sane country would accept total surrender? Civilized people (if there is such a thing) sit down and negotiate terms of surrender.

c9gwssb,turktransork,">which gives more legitimacy to the actionsHow? This is something often said but I would like to know what scientific difference it makes that civilians were killed through nations fighting nations. To me, it just looks like a bunch of people allowing themselves to take a different perspective on something atrocious on the grounds that they have constructed a social framework and have then proceeded to treat their construction as if it is reality. Does it make a subjective difference? Perhaps. Does it make an objective difference? Of course not."

c9gtzwf,,"So a warning is acceptable enough reason to accept arbitrarily killing of men, women and children, non-combatants.It would be okay now for North Korea to nuke America because they have warned you. If they killed 100,000 times more people than died in the Boston bombings, because they have warned you. It is utterly fucking ridiculous. I can't believe people bought such piss poor reasoning. America would not accept that as an excuse if it happened to them. Look at 911, I mean Osama Bin Laden was issuing warnings/threats, was it acceptable that he then went on to kill completely innocent people?And humanitarian reasons, oh please. Pull the other one its got bells on, humanitarian reasons, saving lives oh for fuck sake, did you swallow this? what a load of fucking shit. ""Yes, we are always thinking of the humanitarian issues when we are planning to wipe out 250,000 people, yes, we only do that on humanitarian grounds"".Those bombs were a gross act of inhumanity, an act of mass murder of non-combatants, a heinous war crime whose intent was a line in the sand to warn every other nation in future that you fuck with America and we will kill your people en-masse.Again if Japan had nuked America you wouldnt be accepting these piss poor excuses, you would never fucking forgive them.But as long as they can justify it, your country will try to get away with it."

Just because the military didn't surrender doesn't mean that people still supported it or that people weren't victims of indoctrination. We're not talking about bombing a factory and maybe blowing up some surrounding buildings, we leveled these cities and turned people into ashes because the military wouldn't stop.

c9guabl,Lufster000,Your right but vague. Japan surrendered only because Russia was coming at the other side. The US had been destroying thier cities for awhile before the bomb. Also they DID surrender but they wanted to keep their emperor who was seen as a religious figure almost. We said no dice. But in the end we let Japan keep his post. Fun fact. The bomb never had to be dropped to win the war. We already won but did it for long term purposes outside of WW 2.

Yeah, sure you'd buy that shit. As long as Ive got a hole in my arse, it will never be justifiable to kill innocent civilians en-masse, because if you can justify that you have to justify 911.

c9gt0xu,stephen89,"You know what we did prior to those attacks? We gave warning of the bombings, we told them when these bombings would occur, we told them that the bombs would be devastating, we told them to surrender. They refused once, they let us drop a second bomb without taking our warning seriously and evacuating or surrendering. You want to blame somebody? Blame the Japanese. The atom bombs saved so many lives on both sides of the war it isn't even funny."
c9gudv1,Untoward_Lettuce,"What if the tables had been turned and it was Japan dropping bombs on the mainland US. Would you have been eager to give an unconditional surrender, meaning that Japan essentially owns the US and can do whatever it wants with it? We probably would have been at least as ""stubborn"" as Japan before surrender.I recall an interview with a German soldier who was a machine gunner at Normandy. He said his only though while cutting down soldiers on the beach was, ""I hope *this* horrific disaster will finally make our enemies see how wrong it is to be attacking us, so all this killing can stop.""Every side is righteous from their own perspective in war, and almost every side bears incredible losses before admitting defeat."
c9gy1xu,stephen89,"If it will save your people, surrender is something all great leaders need to be willing to do. The arrogance and stubbornness of the Japanese at the time of WWII was insane. They were arming women and children, they never planned on giving up. Millions of lives would have been lost.As far as the German soldier goes, we all know who was righteous and who wasn't in that fight. Believe me, I don't blame the every day German soldier for fighting. At the end of the day his people were being attacked back, but they were still the instigators and the country as a whole was responsible for terrible things. The Japanese were equally instigators and responsible for terrible things."
c9gvd7m,waspbr,Sure blame the victims. If you believe that the point of the bombs was to save lives then you should take a deep breath and enjoy the smell of your squeaky clean washed brain. The soviets had just broken the non aggression treaty with Japan and were prepared to invade after they took over Japan's assets in Manchuria. The Japanese surrender came after the threat of an imminent soviet invasion and not the bombs.The bombs were a message to the soviets and did little to convince the Japanese since they have had far more casualties from the firebombing.

Sorry about any spelling errors, on a nook and this think kind of sucks for typing."
c9gua0p,samsdayfuss,"I'm not the one implying that. If you are using your ends to justify your means, or what is morally OK to do, then you can literally do anything. After all, it doesn't matter what you do, because your end goal justifies it. It is an absurd argument to say that nuking the japanese was OK because it ended the war. It is a reversal of logic. Because of what it accomplished, my actions become the correct choice. Also, at that time there were multiple ways to end the war. We could have offered them a conditional surrender, but truman wanted to boost his ego."
c9guygg,katkill3r,"A couple things. First, the surrender wasn't unconditional, hirohito was allowed to stay in power. The emperor remained on the throne.Source on Truman wanting to boost his ego? Cause that's just not true. Truman didn't want to drop the bomb. He just wanted to end the war as quickly as possible and spare american and japanese lives. He always wanted to prevent a future flare up from a poor resolution to the war (similar to how WWII rose out of the ashes of WWI).We don't live in a world of absolutes. We can very easily use ends to justify means in certain circumstances. Very rarely is something always 100% of the time wrong. And even if it is, then you have to justify how and why something is wrong, which is a whole other conversation upon itself. Anyways, I'm done ranting.

That's not always possible but there is no reason they want the public to fear them.Comparing that to random bombings just to instill fear in public safety is disingenuous and confusing issues.

Whatever sadness you feel for yesterday's victims, the same level of sadness is warranted for the innocent people whose lives are ended by American bombs. However profound a loss you recognize the parents and family members of these victims to have suffered, that's the same loss experienced by victims of US violence. It's natural that it won't be felt as intensely when the victims are far away and mostly invisible, but applying these reactions to those acts of US aggression would go a long way toward better understanding what they are and the outcomes they generate.The point is that Americans have been extremely detached from the people that they have killed and the suffering that they have caused, and causing suffering is easy when you don't have to see it or experience it.

c9gsjpw,eamus_catuli,"So much simplistic and flawed thinking. Where to begin...For starters, the Taliban didn't attack the U.S. Ever. al-Qaeda did. The U.S. Congress gave the President authorization to use military force against ""those who committed"" 9/11 AND ""those who harbored"" them. Ostensibly, the Taliban was ""harboring"" them - although evidence exists that for years (even before 9/11), they had been in discussions with the U.S. to hand Osama bin Laden and other key al-Qaeda figures over to U.S. or Pakistani authorities. Those discussions became moot when, in March, 2001 (before 9/11, of course) the U.S. decided that it would take steps toward seeing that regime change occurred in Afghanistan.""Returning power to the people"". The Taliban *are* the people in Afghanistan. Or more accurately, there is no unified idea of ""the people"". Afghanistan is an artificial creation of colonialist powers. Imagine taking Europe, and arbitrarily drawing a line around parts of France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and calling everything inside that border ""Happy Land"". That's Afghanistan. It's a collection of distinct tribes and clans that colonizers threw a border around and called ""Afghanistan"". Like many other countries (particularly in Africa) where European colonizers have done this type of arbitrary line drawing - it's led to decades of disagreements and power struggles. The Taliban, believe it or not, ruled over a period of relative peace and harmony in Afghanistan. For this reason, they had many, many supporters in Afghanistan. (Which isn't to say that their strict Islamist sharia-based legal system shouldn't be frowned upon.) But to imply that the Taliban represent ""the evil dictators"", while, say, the Northern Alliance represented ""the good guys who wanted to bring peace and harmony"" to the country is a ridiculous caricaturization of the situation there pre-U.S. invasion."

c9gt2vi,upvotesthenrages,"And you could easily turn this around:The U.S. spends money training the Taliban against the USSR invasion. They promise their support if the Taliban win the war. They promise that schools will be built, roads etc etc. The Taliban win the war. The U.S. doesn't uphold it's promise. The Taliban rule the country and are angry because their country was bombed to shit. The U.S. invades Afghanistan. The Taliban train soldiers to defend their country. The U.S. bombs the country for 12 years - and they still don't understand why things like Boston happen, or why there is so much hate towards them?"

It was an unjust war of choice based on fabrications and lies.Any death at the hands of the U.S. was not ""accidental"". We shouldn't have been fighting there in the first place. There should have been no bombs dropped such that there could even *be* accidental deaths.Do you see the point?The closest I can come to this is drunk driving ""accidents"". Drunks technically get in ""accidents"". They crash in a manner that they would otherwise choose not to, or is unintended. But the choice to get behind the wheel when drunk is no accident. Therefore, any deaths that occur as a result of a drunk driver aren't really ""accidental""."

Do you suffer less?I think that's the point of this whole article: suffering is universal. For now, let's mourn for the victims of this attack.

The idea that there are no ""Accidental"" consequences to bad actions engaged in purposefully. It's an idea that exists throughout society. Another example: there are no ""accidental"" deaths when you're in the middle of committing a felony. It's called the felony murder rule.

Not too mention they've hit schools, busy marketplaces and other urban areas where they know many men and children are. And we do it constantly. Some estimates have been as high as 4000 people killed by drone strikes, with a 50:1 ratio of civilians to actual terrorists. >'accidental casualties among citizens in a war'It's not just the so called ""war"" in Afghanistan... these are also direct encroachments on the sovereignty of Pakistan and Yemen.

I certainly wouldn't be any less pissed off. It's also worth considering that a nation that *knows* that its deliberate attacks will cause a certain amount of civilian deaths is not taking their actions blindly. The decision to fire a missile is a deliberate decision to fire a weapon that will likely kill x civilians and the broader action of pursuing a war involves the decision to take actions that you know in advance will kill hundreds if not thousands of innocents. The innocents are not just accidental deaths after the fact. The certainty of their loss are known from the beginning and are accepted as a reasonable cost for achieving certain objectives. I find it hard to treat such an attitude to civilian casualties, as an acceptable cost for the goals we want to achieve, as any different from the far far smaller numbers that arise from deliberate targeting. It is simply a cognitive trick to disassociate one's actions from responsibility for those deaths."
c9gwr5y,YouBWrong,"Thanks. I was hoping someone would say this and I was hoping it wouldn't be buried at the bottom. Terrorism is what you do when you are out of options. If you don't have a superior military, or a way to negotiate, or you are crazy or dumb. Only then do you resort to intentionally targeting innocents to make everyone feel vulnerable and get yourself some kind of leverage. To accuse the United States of terrorism is ridiculous, not because we're above it (although I hope we are) but because we don't need it.Drone attacks might strike terror into the heart of the Taliban and their supporters, and they claim far too many civilian casualties, but that is not their intent. Their intent is to take out the fighters and the leadership. If those guys would stop hiding in places that are full of kids then a lot fewer kids would be dying. If the parents of those children would not allow people associated with the Taliban to hide in their homes, their kids would be safer."

Were it not for *our* concern for innocent casualties and international image, we truly would have this wrapped up in a fortnight.

And it's not. That's how trivial these wars are to the US; it's better to lose them fighting fairly because winning really isn't important to the nation.I often think of europe in WW2, when children were evacuated from London to avoid the carpet bombings. And I'm sure other cities were much the same. It's called a state of total war, and the us has not been in that state since hiroshima and nagasaki.Compare it to a fist fight. I never fight fairly because I'm a pascifist. If we're fighting, it's because I'm fighting for my life, and the rules go out the window.

"" I didn't support going to Iraq, and I sure as hell wasn't the only one. Very few people would support the shitty practices that go on, but the truth is that most never hear it from a non-biased source. Our media in the US is bought and paid for, with very few exceptions. EDIT because this applies to so many of the response comments: We have many, many problems with the structure of our political system. The lobbyists and politicians are all paid for as well as the media, and from many of the same pockets. We as citizens are given the classic giant douche or turd sandwich options and that's it. But I have to say, I really think we're getting better. Not as fast as any of us would like, but we're getting there. When something like this happened before to the trade center, we immediately reacted and went to war. This time, not only are the warmongers far out on the fringe, the people in general are actually willing to WAIT for the investigations to finish. Not only that, the vast majority of us are actually HOPING they weren't Muslims. We actually WANT this to be some crazy US citizen because we're tired of the vitriol aimed at the Muslim population. So yeah, we have a president that is authorizing drone strikes and hasn't closed down gitmo. But I'd say it's a hell of a step forward that we finally chose a guy that SAID he would close it down. To the world, I say ""Please don't give up on us. We really are trying to make a change!""TL;DR - We're trying, but we have a nation-wide learning disability."
c9gv28n,Kamho,"Your wife is right. There's so much hate for the US, but every time I've travelled there I've been treated politely by anyone I end up talking to. I'm a Canadian born Chinese. I think Americans are unfairly judged and most Americans are nice people."

US foreign policy puts money above the human rights and freedoms of human beings, its positively vile.However I do understand that the political system is a stitch up and run for the rich and not really a democracy and the media is owned by the very same people and it doesn't present a balance and is used to brainwash Americans into supporting their leaders decisions. American people are generally nice, you can't really generalize about people, some of the greatest political thinkers in this world are American. Americans don't have much choice right now, they may think they do but they would be mistaken. Glenn Greenwald, the author of this piece is American.You should not judge a nation by the actions of its politicians."

How would you fix such intractable corruption without violence, when the democratic process has been compromised?"
c9gwgb4,,"It's difficult because the concept of a free media is compromised too, so while you may get a fringe, the masses are still going to believe what they are told. You need a really strong third party that offers a better choice and people need to choose that en-masse one time. If only to change the system and force choice back in. I really like the idea of seat limits in the Egyptian parliament. Failing that mass disobedience and violence may be the only way forward, but that's really not very American."

c9gxvxg,Kamho,"Yes. I'm just specifying I didn't immigrate to Canada. For example my parents would be Chinese-Canadian, but they weren't born here. I was born here so that's why I pointed it out. Just said that to iron out the nuances, for example, my English is better than my parents, etc. May be different from how my parents are treated in the USA, but every time I went to Florida with them we were all treated very well.I've been to New York City and Massachusetts without my parents, and found the locals to be extremely friendly (I know, New York City, right?!). I actually stayed at the hotel right next to that library the bombings happened at - my girlfriend and I went last year for one of Red Sox's last games for the 100th anniversary. I loved the atmosphere despite my friends giving me shit about cheering for Bosox (for some reason, Boston and New York's sports teams are villainized for sports fans). I feel really terrible about the marathon bombing in particular because I know how much that event matters to the running world, and because I recognize the location from the pictures. It was surreal seeing all the pics taken, because I'd walk down that street every morning looking for breakfast during my stay there :("

Probably not your average southern guy.edit: I also...don't know where Canada gets its nice people reputation from. I'm going to be frank, the treatment I get travelling to other parts of Canada is generally NOT good. I live in Toronto and when I travel to small townships or whatever, people aren't exactly rude, but definitely unfriendly. Montreal is the worst. They seem to hate anyone that doesn't speak French, especially if you're not white. I mean outright rude, for no reason."

You're right, I think the sports community in general is nicer, there's always a sense of camaraderie even when cheering for opposing teams, at least in my experience :)good to hear our Leafs fans are nice.

c9gz1vh,,"Of course, Jefferson probably wouldn't have been talking about the US government as a democracy. It wasn't until about the time of Andrew Jackson that ""democracy"" became a good word in politics, and the American republic was rebranded a democracy."
c9gzcjt,YouBWrong,"Okay, that's what I get for being lazy and not looking something up before I go blabbing about it. The correct quote is: “Every nation has the government it deserves.” “Toute nation a le gouvernement qu'elle mérite.”) Joseph de Maistre (1753-1821)"
c9gzgp6,,"Gotcha. Still, I don't particularly agree with it. Government is still fundamentally centered around protecting the interests of a ruling class, so if you define a nation by its people, most don't get a government acting in their interests."
c9gzpt4,YouBWrong,But we are living in a democracy. If we really wanted to we could take control back. We could amend the Constitution to cut the ties between industry the military and politics. We could collectively rise up and demand change. There are even politicians who would help us (hard as that is to believe). But we don't do those things. Most Americans don't see a need for change and aren't interested in listening to you or me talk about it. So every little kid that winds up as collateral damage is partly our fault.

In a dictature of course you're right. If you think US foreign policy is wrong, make it clear, make it known and vote for the guy who'll change that. Problem is that the support for this policy is the majority. The people who don't are a minority.Now it doesn't mean that you should judge one person based on this of course. Everyone is different. It just means that you have a voice and a vote and that you can't claim to be powerless."
c9gxjp3,,Well. The Americans that actually own a passport are far and beyond more versed in world politics than the once that don't...Us foreigners quickly realise that you (as in the ones that come here) aren't stupid bible thumpers that want to nuke the middle east.

Fortunately, no one I knew was injured yesterday; but still, I found it terribly personal and shocking and surreal to have this happen in my back yard. But it was within the first few hours of the tragedy, watching over and over again the people screaming and running in panic on the footage, that I found myself thinking, This must be what it feels like to have a drone hit nearby. One minute everything is fine, just a day in the life, and the next... bodies and limbs strewn about. The panic and confusion, the fear that the next explosion might be just around the corner. Can you imagine a third bomb in the midst of the ambulances and first responders? or a fourth on the common tonight as mourners held a vigil? Unfortunately, US ""doubletaps"" mean exactly that for some of our victims. I am very sad for my city, and very sad for the victims of yesterday's attack, but I am also sad for the innocent victims of our ""war on terror""."

One of the first points made in the article:>targeting rescuers with ""double-tap"" attacks is precisely what the US now does with its drone program and other forms of militarism. If most Americans knew their government and military were doing this, would they react the same way as they did to yesterday's Boston attack?It seems like this journalist is simply trying to point out what we do in other countries, and that we should be sympathetic to what happens to them, too... We expect other countries to mourn our losses, and are **clearly** critical of them when they have anything else to say (see: every upvoted comment in this thread)...

I don't doubt it, but I also think that INTENT is very important. If the American military started dropping bombs on crowded Sunday markets because that's where all the people are and they will cause the most casualties... Then I think you can starting drawing parallels. Now, should Americans care more about the random senseless car bombings in Iraq? Yes I think so. These terrorists aren't limiting their attacks to western/non-Muslim people. They also target Muslims! It's completely barbaric and will only stop when the entire Muslim world is somehow pulled out of the dark ages and their economies given new life so all these unemployed young men can find jobs and a purpose in their communities. Then suicide bombings won't be such an attractive option. The middle east was once a hub of progress, science, and intelligence. The world would be best served if those qualities returned."

I agree that extremes are always problematic. As far as lack of empathy Americans have for the recipients of US political/military collateral damage, I can assure you it is not out of spite or animosity. It's a lack of education and an issue of ignorance. As in almost any country, the history books here are incredibly myopic, and in this country, our primary education system doesn't come close to providing an objective account of the United States' role in modern world history.That doesn't change my belief that typical Americans are some of the kindest and most generous people on the planet."

What kind of person do you think I am?I'm still a few years from 30 and I've been to more anti-war demonstrations that you'll probably go in your lifetime.Also, it's simply to true that all those actions have no consent within the american people. Pools and re-elections show that the government's foreign policies are not completely disconnected from the people's will. Millions of people died as a result of american interventions since WW2. Leaving dozens of millions mourning. Some of the worst kind of people got direct financial and political support by the us government and used it to rape and kill civilians. It goes on and on, it fills thousands of pages in history books.You think you can take hundreds of thousands of brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers and the likes from other people and say ""oops"" every time? Humans don't work that way. As I said, you sowed hate for decades, and you'll reap hate for decades. Civilians have always been on the short end of the straw, the only difference now is that the nationality changes. It's not about fairness, it is all unfair, but it's far from unexpected.Oh and about your corrections and insults, it is a direct quote from the bible. And even if it wasn't, english is not my first language, more like my fourth, so watch your tone if you want to be taken seriously."
c9gx2om,AuxHero,"When you say you reap what you sow you are implying they deserved it, whether you realize it or not. How excellent for you to have been to so many anti-war rallies, I'm not really sure why that is relevant at all to this conversation. Does that make you an expert? You have no idea who I am or what I have done in my life. That pseudo intellectual revolutionary thing is really working for you though, keep it up.Do you think the people who reelected people like Bush have any idea what is really going on. Come on man. That's the fox news demographic. There are no sane people in America that wants our government to kill civilians, so don't try and give me some bullshit argument that government policies aren't connected to the people's will. Of course they are, but do you think the American people vote on covert operations. The American people don't even vote on military operations, much less individual mission.Who do you mean sowed hate? The government? I'm I sowing hate? Because that's what you are saying? Or do you mean America in general, in which case, you are just as ignorant and narrow minded as the people who watch fox news. When you say shit like ""now the nationality changes a bit,"" its like you are saying now its America's turn to feel this shit. Its unacceptable to all innocent people. Finally, my initial point was that there is a difference between a terrorist attack and collateral damage. You don't know what collateral damage means, and then made the statement that the American people are reaping what they have sown."
c9gx5w5,un_aguila_por_favor,"When you put seeds in the ground and water them, something will grow. Not because you deserve it, but because that's how it is. It's simply cause and effect.It means that you have no position to accuse me of being willing to sacrifice civilian lives. As I've likely invested a multitude more time, money and energy against political injustices than you.For me it's obvious you're applying double standards here. And do I really have to explain what kind of effect the american foreign policies have on the locals? And yes, in a way it is americas turn to feel this shit. Again, this is not about justice, just about action and reaction. It is unacceptable and tragic, but logical.You as a nation brought war to dozens of countries, and what happens is a logical backlash. Why would you even expect that not to happen? After 60 long and bloody years of that kind of foreign policies.I agree that there is a difference between collateral damage and a direct terrorist on the civilian population. But bombing weddings and the likes... seriously.. what do you expect people to feel? Also, it enrages me that many americans don't feel any responsibility for all the horrible things that happened. You put those people in power over the last decades, it's YOUR government."

I'm not sure why you keep trying to tell me how much protesting you have done.The point I was trying to make is that there is a difference between collateral damage and a fucking terrorist attack. Yes the collateral damage is terrible. I don't think what the american gov and military has and is doing is ok, but there is a difference between targeting civilians straight up, and killing them as collateral damage. That difference may be small, but it is there.Those people that died yesterday didn't sow shit. They are not responsible for the decisions that a select few people behind closed doors make."
c9gxeux,un_aguila_por_favor,"As you said, the difference is relatively small in some cases. Now think about the fact that a few thousand times more non-americans died than americans, and then imagine the anger that has accumulated in the last decades. Take 2 minutes and try to imagine how many completely innocent people are suffering in this very moment as a result of american interventions decades ago, or in some cases, minutes ago.It's always the ""little"" ones who end up suffering, on all sides.And it's not like nothing you do has an effect on the world. (Re)electing Bush, as one example, could definitely have helped creating the situation we have now. Reagan, Nixon and so on didn't fall from the sky into oval office (twice)."

The U.S Military does not go out of its way to specifically target civilians, even if you disagree with our (specifically the CIA's) ROE regarding drone strikes. Our double tap strikes aren't intended to kill civilian first responders either.People like to talk a lot about how we should feel empathy for everyone in the world, not just our own. That's not really how empathy works though; people naturally feel a stronger emotional response towards others who are similar to them. Feeling that way doesn't make you a bad person, it makes you a person. Here's the biggest deal for me. If you tweet about how Syria/Yemen/Northwest Iraq/Africa is far more deadly, what exactly are you doing to help? I mean hell, there were 530 gang related homicides in Chicago last year alone. In the United States. There's tragedy everywhere. So if you find yourself complaining, instead why don't you take some time to think, or have a quality discussion with someone on what to do about it.The worst case scenario is that you don't come up with anything worthwhile, which means your time spent was still as effective as the tweet you would have made anyway."

Should they have made a better target I.D? Absolutely, but I would like to see evidence that they willingly targeted civilians."

If I drive drunk and kill some people, I may not be as guilty as if I intentionally murdered those people.

That's not really how empathy works though; people naturally feel a stronger emotional response towards others who are similar to them. Feeling that way doesn't make you a bad person, it makes you a person.See, this makes me worried you didn't read the article after all.

I'd argue that an impulse to care little about suffering, simply because it's not nearby, is a bad one, even if it's natural. There's no objective reason why less proximal suffering is less immoral. Since it's natural, it's excusable, to an extent--but when it is pointed out, I can't see why one would defend it.Why do you think it's moral?"
c9htmju,,"See, I don't think it's an impulse to *not* care about suffering, it just *not* an impulse to care about suffering. Our natural state is to not feel constant empathy because we are not naturally surrounded by inescapable tragedy. By your logic it would be immoral to not feel empathy for every death or sorrowful moment anyone has ever experienced in the world. Proximal suffering isn't less immoral, its just naturally more emotionally significant.I think that we just disagree on whether or not a human's natural state is empathetic or passive. I think it's passive, because we are driven to empathy by unusual events or thoughts. It is not something that's constantly on our minds, and it can't possibly be.

There are a LOT more of the former than there are of the latter, and the relatively greater intensity of their emotional outrage than ours is due to the extremity of their situation. We'd start getting a lot angrier too if this happened every other day.How many Americans joined the US Military after 9/11 just so they could go kill some ""ay-rabs""? How many of them got over there and completely ignored the rules of warfare and used the opportunity to rape and murder and torture? I can think of several high profile incidents right off the top of my head. Even if we pretend that all of those people burning effigies and protesting are trying to actively participate in blind retaliation, can you really honestly say that we have not also blindly retaliated? How can you really say that their emotion is that different?"
c9hj63x,pantsfish,"I can honestly say that ""we"" have not blindly retaliated, because I never raped or murdered anyone, and I assume you didn't either. But that's besides the point.

You are obtusely conflating these senses to create a false dichotomy.

This doesn't mean the emotion isn't ""the same"" in the sense that senseless violence against innocent people brings out feelings of outrage and further, outrage is outrage.

c9iaejs,feignrmk,"I can assure you, I'm not confused. A motive is a reason for doing something, but again, just because I might have a good reason to do X does not mean I'm actually going to do that thing.

I was visiting my dear old Grandmother in Tennessee last week when that man ended up dead. It couldn't have been me!"" Motive, but no action. Or to use one of your senses of the word, a motive as an incentive or goal.

Again, motive without action. > So at what point does an elaborate violent fantasy become a plan?When there is intent to make the fantasy a reality.

A motive is defined as a cause to an action. Without the action, the motive (the cause of the action) does not exist. When innocence is proven, it goes without saying that nothing caused you to take an action that you didn't take. In a legal sense, intent is different than motive, as it only describes mental state independent of action.In short, there is no definition of ""motive without action"". You've conflated it with intent.>When there is intent to make the fantasy a reality. Burning a stuffed doll with Obama's picture taped to it does not constitute planning to murder anyone.No, it only represents a great desire to murder to inflict bodily harm on someone. It's an expression of personal desire, a reenactment of their fantasy which they cannot make into reality due to physical limitations. Unless you want to tell me I that they are burning stuffed dolls because they need a way to get rid of stuffed dolls.Likewise, the idea of someone burning an effigy of you on the opposite side of the world might not worry you.

c9guu1e,captsuprawesome,"Death of innocents is always an outrage.The problem with drones is they've been sold as a high-precision, no collateral damage, method of warfare. Furthermore their use has been wrapped in secrecy, so it's been hard to objectively judge them. Another potentially troubling thing about drones is that it creates an artificial distance between the attacker and the target. Presumably a solider on the ground will have to face the moral consequences of their actions (i.e. and therefore act more responsibly if faced with a difficult decision ) than a solider behind a computer screen thousands of miles away. Though if this is really different then a human pilot bombing someone is a fair point.Personally for me (and this is deviating from the original point), most of the ""drone debate"" boils down to a ""due process"" debate. I don't think the president should have the unchecked power to order the assassination of people (especially citizens) who he says are guilty of something but have never been charged or convicted of a crime."
c9gv5ot,verteUP,"Drones have been hidden for a reason. So people aren't brazen enough to think they can ""objectively judge"" a device of war. Because such a thing is not possible by the average citizen. These modern wars are the first in the history of the world in which every Tom, Dick, and Harry had their nose in them and thus has a supposed ""highly informed"" opinion. I mean you are comparing a drone with a human infantryman when you should be comparing a drone to a plane. Because that's exactly what it is. It doesn't create any more of an artificial distance than a human-in-the-cockpit plane creates. Both drop bombs. Both are piloted by a human. The fact of the matter is that drones do offer a surgeons scalpel. Drones are used to kill enemy combatants. It's that simple. Enemy combatants have never been given due process in any war. Blaming drones and Obama for a war started by Mr. Bush over 10 years ago is asinine and foolish. We are taking the attention away from the real issue and putting it on a non-issue."
c9gvfp9,captsuprawesome,"First, off the original discussion was not about drones, you're the one who brought it up and asked my opinion.Second, the discussion was on whether innocent people were dying. It is apparent that many innocent people are dying and that most of the casualties are not terrorists. We have killed more than twice the number of children than high profile targets. That is not really ""scalpel"" precision (as someone who commonly uses a scalpel, trust me on this). Third I think the death of innocents is a major issue - it is the number one recruitment tool for terrorist organizations. And it is the duty of the citizens to participate in public discourse and act as a check on their government. And you are wrong about people not caring about such things in the past. Have you heard of Dresden?Fourth I think you need to look back at how drone warfare was sold. It absolutely was sold as an alternative to an occupying force (drones patrol, bombers bomb). There is no question drones are safer for our soldiers. But are they more effective at making America safe from terrorist attacks? Well, when you create more terrorists (via the deaths of innocents) than you kill, you have a problem...Fifth your comparison on ""due process"" conflates a lot of issues in terms of what traditionally has been defined as a battlefield (in the past the ""battlefield"" has not been defined as the entire earth) and ignores important separation of powers issues that are the foundation of the Constitution. Regardless, please stop putting words in my mouth - you obviously have preconceived notions about what I believe (have I once mentioned Obama?). If you'd like to have a serious discussion, I'm all for it (I've not downvoted you on anything). If you'd like to continue to cut and paste general arguments that don't address the discussion at hand, or persist in the false belief that innocent people do not die during drone attacks, I'd rather not be involved."
c9gvrrx,verteUP,War is hell. Innocents will always die in wars. Always. There have been fewer innocent deaths in Afghanistan/Iraq than any war in history by enormous margins. You compare a drone to a human infantryman and then claim I'm the one who went off topic. Drone warfare was never sold as anything other than as a way to keep human pilots from dying. It doesn't matter whether a drone drops the bomb or a human pilot flying from the cockpit drop it. Drone attacks are not increasing the deaths of innocents any more than conventional bombing attacks. Drones can fly at very slow speeds and very low altitudes with high definition cameras capable of reading a restaurant menu. All of this at no risk to a human pilot. This is why they are used. They are a wonderful thing. They are a scalpel whereas a plane with a human in the cockpit is a hammer. I mean you've already gone and compared a human infantryman to a drone so I can't expect much from your opinion at this point.
c9h4ma7,captsuprawesome,"Regardless, you agree innocent people dying and war is hell. Ask yourself why, in a discussion about empathy for innocents that die at the hands of the actions of our government (i.e. trying to better understand the loss and suffering that an Afghan or Yemeni family feels), you feel the need to speak about how drones ""are a wonderful thing"". I don't think I'm going to convince you of anything - if you actually cited relevant information instead of repeating blanket statements you might have changed my mind. I suppose this will just have to be another instance where someone on the internet disagrees with me."
c9gt3yl,stephen89,"Americans aren't ignorant of the impact, our govt is as corrupt and broken as all the rest. If they don't want to stop there isn't much we can do aside from armed revolution."
c9gsn1z,GinSwigga,"Many Americans aren't aware of what is going on in other countries, whether caused by the US or not. US media's fault? Yeah, but other world media is also to blame as this incident received front page notice everywhere, while the attack in Iraq was a distant second. For this article to blame the bombing in Iraq on America was wrong. Yeah it probably wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for the invasion, otherwise it had nothing to do with America."

c9gqz1x,Frondescence,"Well put. I think what the journalist was trying to say was that an event like what happened in Boston will be in our minds forever; it's heart-wrenching. But what should ALSO be in our minds forever is what the US is doing to other countries (didn't read the article, but I'm assuming it's related to drone strikes). However, coming from my own opinion, while they're equally saddening, there is one of these types of tragedies that is capable of being stopped. I think we all know which one that is."
c9gubjw,madoog,"Not even that, I think. I am angry that there could be such shitheads who would think doing this was a remotely good idea. Why why why? Who are these shitheads?I don't doubt that someone out there feels a similar rage when a bomb goes off in their neighbourhood and scares or harms them. When they find out the source, they direct their rage that way. I think the quote is more about recognising how this sort of event makes you feel, and using this to try to understand how this feeling could potentially motivate someone to attack the perpetrator of such horror in retaliation. Are they wrong to do so? Sure. But you can kind of understand where they're coming from. 'They hate us blowing up their families and communities' makes a darned sight more sense than 'they hate our freedoms'."
c9gv2aw,seriousbob,"Not even that much, since we naturally care more for people close to us. Just that we emphasise with the feelings of anger and sadness in the aftermath. This big ""why"". That feeling of helplessness and senseless destruction, that is the same."
c9gs3bt,TheFundanceKid,"Hey, I understand that you, and a lot of other people don't like drone strikes(here comes that awesome however...) However...the fact is we kill LESS people with drones than we do with American soldiers, marines, seamen and airmen. And it costs less American lives. I know it makes people super uncomfortable and it's against ""popular progressive opinion,"" but its true. The fact is if we weren't using drones to kill people, we'd be using a much more inaccurate method. We're gonna kill people no matter what, we're just trying to find the least casualty ridden method to do it. The level of innocents killed before we started using drones is HIGHER than after we started using drones. I'm not sure how people keep missing this. Robots make people uncomfortable I guess."
c9gt9rb,Deathmagus,"I think what makes people uncomfortable is the idea of a nation becoming ever more ready to start and escalate unethical conflicts because the only thing they risk is some equipment. Ideally, all conflicts should be carefully considered and found ethical, but people generally feel that having some ""skin in the game"" is a useful fall-back to allay poor ethical decisions."
c9gs29b,Osiriskiller,Do you mean the deaths caused by war are the type that is capable of being stopped? Or the unpredictable attack in Boston?
c9gv0df,seriousbob,"Not even that much, since we naturally attach more to closer things. Just that we recognise our feelings of rage and hurt are the same."
c9grl9p,wolfdogrhit,"I don't agree. You feel worse about a friend or family member dying than a complete stranger. I have more in common with my countryman and even though it's uncool to be patriotic these days it doesn't change the fact that we're part of the same community.Edit: I guess ""should"" is the operative word here. We should obviously feel empathy for other innocent people in these situations, I just think it's counter to human nature to try to feel the *same* amount of empathy."
c9gruy5,Not_So_Funny_Meow,"I think the point to be made is that we would be much better off as a species if we viewed all of humankind as our countrymen, regardless of geopolitical boundaries. The gap between what you have in common with people from your own country and what you have in common with those from other countries likely isn't as large as most people seem to think."

c9grljb,BeQuake,To me this is like saying you should feel just as bad for a random stranger dying as your best friend. Sure you probably should if we were all perfect in mind and soul but we are human therefore we have more attachment to some things over others. That being said for Americans bombing of Americans gets more feeling than bombing of non Americans. May not be right but that is how people are and always will be. Just like people in Iraq right now care more about the bombing they had then the one we did.

A bombing in a place that gets bombed every day isn't nearly as important or sad as a bombing in a place that never gets bombed. What changes when a bomb goes off and kills innocent civilians in Baghdad? Not a damn thing. It's business as usual. What happens when a bomb goes off in Boston? We're about to see another land-grab against civil rights and a massive expansion of the police state in this country, just like we did after 9/11 and after Sandy Hook. That's what I'm truly sad about. With every travesty, a few people die...what are a few lives compared to the freedoms our entire country loses forever? Do you even remember it? Before 9/11? When you could post something on the internet without fear that the FBI might take an interest in it and come to your door for an interview? I'd give 10 bostons to have that back.

Empathy is about understanding not how those around you feel and are affected, but how the whole world, how human kind feels. We need to unite on a species level I think, and the first step to that is empathy."
c9gprpl,romanov99,"America has done a lot of shit that I disagree with over the past decade or so. I voted against it, but I'm still a citizen, so yes, I'm responsible. But that doesn't change the fact that America, like Japan, like Britain or Italy or Turkey or Australia is a functioning peaceful liberal democracy with no internal sectarian strife of the kind that exists in places like Afghanistan, or Iraq, or Iran, or Syria, and so on and so on. The fact that Americans died is no more or less tragic than the fact that Iraqis died, since every person has inherent worth. BUT the fact that a formerly peaceful country has now been attacked, either from without or within, for the first time in twelve years, is a significant change in a way that yet another suicide bombing in Kabul is not. Do we really want Americans to become so used to these events that they are no more shocking to us than those who live in war torn countries?Because if that happens, I can assure you that the world will find that targeted assassination by drone was in fact our country's most restrained response to this sort of attack."
c9gsagc,EnemyWessel,"I think you misunderstand history by calling us a ""formerly peaceful country."" They didnt attack us in 2001 because they found us in a phone book. America has been murdering its way across the world since the 1800's. I love my country but I wont fool myself into saying we are completely innocent. I hate whoever commits acts of terror and it would be hypocritical of me to not hate our own system of terror. Our soldiers (our brothers and sisters) are dying in foreign places because of screwed up government power plays. I hate that as much as I hate the systems that convince poor kids to strap on bombs."
c9h0ds2,,">America has been murdering its way across the world since the 1800'sWell, its not so much different in the other countries mentioned (Iraq, Afghanistan etc)."
c9h1njl,EnemyWessel,The point is that we arent innocent any more than those nations. I believe our system of govt is far better but bad people still get power.
c9haphq,Adam__Orth,But these were good white people that died here. Not just some greasy Muslims that no one cares about.
c9hc6w8,EnemyWessel,I heard my neighbors saying almost the same thing. Its a shame.
c9iaktb,,"These nations are literally war zones where the locals are killing each other in record numbers, look at Yemen, Syria, Pakistan, Mali etc. There is no way you can compare that to US's involvement in these nations. US has done fucked up things in the past, doesn't mean everything has to be seen through that lens."
c9gvzau,romanov99,"First, as I said above I meant peaceful in the sense of ""free of civil strife"". But even so, while you're right that the US has been involved in a lot of wars, in 2001 the only place we were actively worried about were North Korea and the Balkans. The 9-11 attacks really were an unprovoked attack that demanded a response. Sometimes that happens.Iraq, not so much, of course."
c9gw8ke,ExplodingPenguin,"It depends which side you are coming from regarding September 11. If you take into account the US involvement in various areas of the Middle East over the last 40-50 years - Saudi, Yemen, Bahrain, Iraq, Iran, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Afghanistan; and its unwavering support of Israel in spite of international condemnation you could say the US prodded a hornets nest and got what was coming to it (the US I mean, not the individuals - there is a distinction).On the other hand, if you ignore all of the US dick slingin' in the middle east and just focus on their overt attacks on countries then no, the US didn't attack anyone directly in order to warrant a response like the September 11 attacks.It should also be noted that part of the reason these countries have so much civil strife is due to Western powers propping up vile regimes and generally stirring the pot a bit."
c9h8m1q,romanov99,"You exhibit the soft bigotry of low expectations with your comments. In 2001 America had not been at war in any part of the middle east for a decade, and that one had been a war that all of the countries except Iraq supported and participated in. As people have recently shown, it is possible for them to rise up at any point, and the support the US gave to various dictators was not the deciding in factor in whether or not that happened.Of course, if it's easier to think that no one has the ability to effect any change in the world other than the US, your comments are dead on."
c9hafa0,EnemyWessel,I guess you either do not understand or simply deny the existence of covert war. Declared wars and the covert wars our government loves to get involved in are very different. You seem to imply that America had no involvement in setting up those shitty dictatorships because we were not at war. Please read about the actions our govt has taken in the middle east in the past fifty years (which includes helping dictators brutally shut down protests) before you say people are lazy (or have low expectations) if they do not protest their leaders. It is easy for a westerner to protest on the internet. It is something else when those actions carry the very real threat of a govt happily chopping your balls off for it. And our govt. happily supported (and still supports others) people who did that. I get pissed that the taxes I pay go to support torture and terror.
c9hq1wu,romanov99,"I know all about the crappy actions that my country has taken across the Middle East and the world, and the dictators we've supported because we thought they were better than the Communist opposition. My point, which you seem to be willfully ignoring, is that these countries are almost entirely responsible for their own fates. The meddling of foreigners produces effects on the margins, for the most part. It is extremely presumptuous to think that this strong man or that dictator would magically disappear if only the US did nothing. I think both Castro and the Kim family would happily tell you that even active opposition is not enough to rid a country of their type.So, the poor downtrodden masses in these countries finally have enough, and rise up in righteous indignation to... attack not their own dictators but some other country across the ocean? And of course, that's not why they did so in the first place. AQ launched the 9-11 attacks because there were Christians on the holy soil of Saudia Arabia. Seems almost like they attacked us for something that was unrelated to everything you're talking about, doesn't it?"
c9h01tx,EnemyWessel,"You said it much better than my self. Our covert wars are what cause people to hatw us. We as a free people should demand that that kind of shit stop. We talk a lot of crap about the French, but when they do not like the actions of their govt. they take to the streets."

c9h1nd3,,We aren't China or Russia.
c9hm3pn,EnemyWessel,"Your continued argument of ""hey everybody does it"" completely misses what we are all saying. We as Americans are fucking tired of paying for terror. I dont give a shit that Russia and France and England do it too, that does not make it right. I am not Russian. I am not French. I am not English. I am American and I do not want my country fighting democracy any more."
c9hpxw7,romanov99,That's not my point. My point is that saying we were attacked because we are particularly warlike only begs the question of why all the other warlike countries in the world were not attacked. I'm right there with you on not wanting to fight any more wars though.
c9hqh0e,EnemyWessel,We were attacked because we support their blood enemy in a major way. Without our support Israel would be destroyed. I dont want to get into that quagmire conversation of who is to blame in that region (all the nations there in my opinion) but that was the reason. Imagine you get in a fist fight with someone on a weekly basis and every time that fist fight ends a man hands your enemy a wad of cash. Eventually do you get more pissed at your opponent or the man who supports him? Its a bad metaphor but it is how I see the situation. We are paying the torturers and that is why our financial center was attacked.
c9iez3s,romanov99,"Given that only ignorant savages have ""blood enemies"", I'm happy to be in the position of being the grownups in the middle east."
c9ig53s,EnemyWessel,I can't tell if you are trolling or just have 'Murka shoved so far up your ass that it messes with your brain.
c9jjonb,romanov99,Name a liberal democracy with a blood enemy and I'll concede the point.
c9gugo4,Soutine,"And if the terrorists are white americans, like Kaczynski or McVeigh? Targeted drone strikes around Massachusetts?"
c9gvvt2,romanov99,"No, unfortunately then we're going to see an erosion of civil liberties that makes the last decade look like it was run by hippies."
c9gw95b,Soutine,"Nah I wouldn't worry too much about that. If the guy is white he'll just be labeled crazy, and it'll be accepted that we can't protect ourselves against crazy people. Like the terrorists I mentioned in my above comment. Their attacks where much worse than this, and not many civil liberties where eroded. If the person is an American Muslim though.... shit's gonna hit the fan."
c9gq54n,Dontinquire,"American here, we have never been a peaceful country. We were not formerly peaceful, we aren't on course to become peaceful. We do not have inner conflict but our actions around the world cannot be disregarded at a whim just because we don't kill each other internally. How many people have we killed in Afghanistan/Iraq? Last time I checked our idiotic wars against terrorism have a body count over 1,000,000. 3,000 people die in a couple building collapses we kill a million in retaliation. Think about Pearl Harbor, we lost maybe a couple thousand lives, we killed 250,000 people in response. This is Americas idea of peace. We'll drop more expensive bombs and kill 10 or 100 to 1. It's not a matter of wanting us to become used to events, it's about putting away the word ""terrorism"" every time anyone dies to violence on our soil. It's about recognizing the animosity other countries hold towards us as a product of our constant efforts to police the whole world. It's about realizing that we spend more on bombs than roads. It's about people who live in this country understanding the fact that 200 Bostonians are not better, more valuable, or worth saving than 200 people in the middle east. [I reiterate, we are NOT peaceful and we never have been in our history. Our foreign policy is about as peaceful as Hitler.](http://americanhistory.about.com/library/timelines/bltimelineuswars.htm)"

c9grg35,Hydrownage,">They didn't have to get the bomb dropped on them..Do you have any idea what you're talking about? There are many factors that lead to the Japanese not surrendering.1. A culture of young jingoistic military officers out to prove their honor as samurai-esque warriors, who believed in racial and Japanese superiority and supremacy. This was the class making the decisions at the time in Japan, not the Emperor or the people.2. Would you believe that a bomb could destroy an entire city in one explosion, had you not seen a nuke? Probably not, and the Japanese wouldn't have either. That's why America dropped the bomb *without alerting the Japanese* what would happen. They bombed first then asked for surrender. Besides, the bombs weren't even directed at a military target, they simply destroyed an entire city. What kind of accountability is that? Ask yourself: is that the decision you would have made?"

Look at Normandy - 20,000 German and Allied casualties on the beaches alone. More than half a million from Overlord. For Christ's sakes, over 300,000 casualties from *Okinawa*.It's fucked right up, but it was World War Two. *50,000,000+ dead civilians*. 250,000 was a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of the war, the most fucked up thing that ever happened in human history.Did the Allies do evil things?

After the dramatic success of the island-hopping campaign, I question this apparent desire to halt and use a naval blockade to win the war.The entire concept is ludicrous - consider, at the very simplest level, the absolute frustration on the home front from such a move. You've just smashed the Nazis, and you lost the race to Berlin. Power projection means you have no choice but to tighten the noose around Japan. You have many men and supplies to redirect.But, how about a naval blockade against Japan? You know, Japan. The legendarily self-reliant civilization that once famously *lived in voluntary exile*. A blockade would bring about an end to the war about as effectively as it would bring democracy to Cuba. Oops.Hirohito brought with him the absolute control of the Japanese people. There was no opportunity to smash the state apparatus in Japan.

That's what really gets me about people complaining that the U.S. led their countries into Afghanistan. Most of those countries are part of NATO; their military defense depends almost entirely on the U.S., and they're comfortable knowing that the U.S. has to defend them if they are ever attacked. Afghanistan is a shitty war with no purpose anymore, but the other countries got involved not because we tricked them, but because they owe us their cooperation. They cannot afford to say ""no, I'm not going to help you, I'm just going to continue contributing nothing at all to the defense of our allies. Good luck!"" They can't afford to say that because [Robert Gates is already hinting that we should dissolve NATO](http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-202_162-20070541.html), and NATO is the reason that most european NATO countries have been able to slash the shit out of their defense budgets.

Of course we killed more people than died in those initial incidents. Those incidents started fucking WARS. Your position would be that World War I was a mistake not because it was fought for the wrong reasons, but because it was started by the assassination of one guy, and so only approximately one guy should have been killed in response.And here, finally, you say that Bostonians are not more worth saving than Iraqis. And frankly, I disagree. Because as a country we have to spend upwards of a million dollars to send a soldier over there to help, and when he gets there he won't know the country and will probably fuck it up as a result.

I really am not sure what we're doing abroad, although I do know that some of it is kind of shitty. Edit: As far as I know, we don't attack just civilians. (I am open to examples of this being incorrect) This, I believe, is where the difference lies. Edit again: Also, I kind of think that having rage toward a terrorist is way different than having rage toward an entire country. I think that rage against a country would include rage against the civilians, who are largely not involved in what the military does.....Just sayin....."
c9grti7,mauxly,"I think this is an excellent question. I do not know. I am really confused by what is actual terrorism and what isn't because that word is vollied about so freely, and has so much emotion attached to it, it's difficult to define it. It seems to me, that lately, it's a terrorist attack if your enemy does it. In reality, it seems to me that it's a terrorist attack if it purposely targets civilians, with absolutely no other strategic merit other than killing civilians. And, this..this is gonna get me in deep shit, but if that last bit is the definition of terrorist attack, it could be argued that 911 wasn't a true terrorist attack. I mean, they went after our financial center (WTC), the Pentagon, and the Whitehouse. It wasn't like they went after Disneyland...NOT defending that attack. Just referencing it as part of the ""What is a terrorist attack"" question.Now, if we are going to loosen the definition of terrorist attack to 'strategic target with a high probability that more civilians will die than the targeted""...er...the USA, and most other countries, could be labeled terrorists, easily.Even under a the really strict definition of terrorist attack, the Boston Marathon attack was terrorism. Civilian casualties from US bomb or drone warfare? Questionable. In all likelihood they try to reduce civilian casualties as much as possible. But the real question, a question that Americans don't have to ask themselves very often given that we are rarely attacked on our soil......when you are maimed, killed, or your family is maimed/killed. Does it matter whether it is terrorism or a legit act of war? Does it really matter when someone, anyone, but especially someone from another nation takes it upon themselves to destroy the single most important thing in your life?Are you really going to give a shit about the word? Or are you going to harbor extreme, maybe even murderous, resentment against that nation?"
c9gs5o7,Stanrock,"I take resentment against a nation to include resentment against civilians as well. This may not be what you meant. You might have meant against the government and the military of a nation. If that is the case, then I guess I don't have a problem with someone comparing our reaction now to them raging against our nation (so long as this doesn't include U.S. civilians.) I mean, specifically, I think it is despicable that someone would target civilians, to be honest, more so than attacking a military base. The rage I have (if any) is toward the perpetrator. NOT HIS COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. (That's in caps for loudness effects, if you would rather that I didn't raise my voice then go ahead and ignore the caps.) Specifically, I don't have rage against Afghanistan. I had rage against the people who organized the attack on the Twin Towers. So, herein lies the problem. I don't entirely know what the journalist meant. Did he mean that harboring rage toward American Civilians is the same as harboring rage toward a terrorist organization? (I accept that the organization could be our government, however, I'm not a government official and I think that I deserve no such rage as I was not consulted when those decisions were made.)tl;dr If the journalist meant that people harbor rage toward our government and military for the killing of their people then I agree that the ""rages"" are similar. If he meant that people harbor rage toward every American because of our military then I disagree as I don't hold rage toward every member of any country for an internal organization's actions."
c9gsk10,mauxly,"You have an excellent point. I think, that in the USA, we have a distinct luxury of integration. We know people from all walks of life, we interact with people who hail from other countries, other religions, we have wonderful access to media and have access to opinions from varying outlets. It gives us the gift of understanding that a nations actions (military actions of the nation) do not necessarily reflect the will of it's people. And especially, the actions of a person do not reflect the will of the nation or the other citizens.However, imagine yourself in an isolated region, with little to no access to media, and little to no access to anyone of a different religion or race. And any access you have with people from a different religion has been under the guise of thousands of years of brutal tribal conflict. That, for generations, it's been drummed into your culture that people who think/look differently than you, will kill you if you don't kill them first. It could seriously warp your perceptions. And then imagine your village being overrun by white people in fatigues, breaking down your door, interrogating you, killing your neighbors. Or an American bomb lands in your neighborhood. I am not justifying terrorism. I am not justifying this mindset. I'm just honestly asking myself if some of the things that our military does (sometimes with the best intentions) doesn't come back and bite us as civilians because we rush in without understanding the cultural differences and the potential backlash. You, my fellow American, do not earn this rage. However, our military represents us overseas. So it is up to all of us to try to understand how our military actions might impact us here on the homeland, and then vote accordingly, for people who seem to have a realistic sense of the blowback of their actions. Again, this is in no way a justification of terrorist attacks. Anywhere. But trying to dig a little deeper into the mindset of the people who perpetrate them might help us adjust our foreign policy to reduce them.It could be argued that, ""Fuck the terrorists! Those backward ass motherfuckers don't get to dictate our foreign policy!""And I agree with that sentiment actually. But, the reality, is the only way to truly battle terrorism is to either quell the desire for it (stop poking the wasps nests), or to rip away at our own constitution and allow wiretapping, and searches, and indefinite detention, and torture...because this is a non traditional war, where any and all of us are suspect...What, in the long run, is our best option?Just asking lots of question. I don't have the answers, I'm just asking."
c9gulic,Stanrock,"I appreciate your response. It seems fairly well-thought out. I understand your explanation of why people in isolated areas might target their anger toward all of us. I have trouble accepting the fact that they believe their military entirely represents their will. In this case, I would hope it would be possible to extend that to any other body of people. I suppose, though, what I hope for and reality are, at times, distinct from each other. It disgusts me to say that specified anger toward a perpetrator is the same as a broader anger toward an entire country. However, if the people with this anger believe that our will is represented by the military's actions, then they really are specifying their anger toward the perpetrator. At this point, I may have to resort to shouting ""I'M RIGHT, YOU'RE WRONG"" until you stop bringing up good points and leave.....I so want us to be different from those isolated countries."
c9gro2k,ohyoFroleyyo,"I think the injuries inflicted would make this attack similar to anti-personnel munitions. The US could take this opportunity to sign the [Mine Ban Treaty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Treaty) and [Convention on Cluster Munitions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Cluster_Munitions), that are designed to prevent these kinds of amputation injuries to civilians."
c9gu26s,Sidebard,"what comes up most often I think in that regard are drone strikes. IIRC there were troubles bc they killed too many civillians, so they changed the definitions... if you are killed by a drone strike and are male you are by definition now not considered acivilian casualty, unless someone proofs to the us that you were. they shifted the burden of proof in killing to the ones being killed. so now ""a lot less civillians"" get killed."

If an American is concerned only about his nation, he will not be concerned about the peoples of Asia, Africa, or South America. Is this not why nations engage in the madness of war without the slightest sense of penitence? Is this not why the murder of a citizen of your own nation is a crime but the murder of the citizens of another nation in war is an act of heroic virtue?...The real tragedy of such narrow provincialism is that we see people as entities or merely as things. Too seldom do we see people in their true *humanness*. A spiritual myopia limits our vision to external accidents. We see men as Jews or Gentiles, Catholics or Protestants, Chinese or American, Nergoes or whites. We fail to think of them as fellow human beings made from the same basic stuff as we, molded in the same divine image...

c9gqqha,jeradj,"I hate those sort of arguments. I'm sure there's an actual phrase that describes it, but the logic is fairly poor.Failure to criticize *everything* that deserves criticism says nothing about the validity of a particular criticism that *is* voiced."
c9gra43,Sarria22,The criticism against the US is valid. What isn't valid is everyone else sitting on their high horses ignoring the fact that their own countries are going happily right along with it all.
c9h8v1f,lelibertaire,Glenn Greenwald is an American. He only writes for the Guardian

c9h2uj0,CannedMango,"I would like to point out that what this article is saying is absolutely *not* ""Oh, well your tragedy is so much smaller compared to all this other stuff going on, stop whining.""It's not even close to saying that.What it *is* saying is that, in this moment of awareness, let's take the time to realize that this is what people around the world feel all the time. When people die in Afghanistan or Pakistan from American drones, often they are civilians or first responders... *this* is what their families and communities feel... except far, far more helpless.This isn't meant to say, your tragedy isn't important, it's meant to say, remember this feeling so that you can more strongly empathize with those who go through this because of American military actions.The general first response from people seems to be a very defensive ""But *I* don't need to be told that... stop patronizing me"". But no article can address every person individually, instead it can only address Americans as a group.Yes, there are many Americans who are very aware of the tragedies that occur overseas and hate that they happen, they empathize with the victims. The problem that these people don't include the media. The problem is that there are people (large numbers of people) who close their ears to this sorts of news and their silence allows it to continue. This article is for that group, and for all of us so that this idea raises to the collective consciousness... which it has *not* done yet. There are still far too many people who ignore tragedies outside of themselves and only pay attention when it touches them directly.That is the purpose of this article, and when we have knee-jerk defensive reactions to that message, we close our own ears to it."
c9gpm5v,,"I haven't seen a whole lot of people quick to point the finger at Muslims but I suspect there's a lot who believe there's a good chance that Muslim terrorists did this. This article is geared in their direction. Personally I'm more inclined to believe it was some right winger due to the fact that it was Boston on tax day but we'll have to wait to see what evidence turns up. Regardless of where you're from & what you believe, I believe people need to feel uncomfortable about our society's double standard when it comes to violence because it's real & it exists. There's a lot of people in this country who are labeled as immoral for having perspective that those who claim to flaunt their morals don't, some of which are realistically morally corrupt from certain points of view & others who are ignorant."
c9gs8ub,onizuka23,Um... seriously? Conservatives bombing innocent people **because its tax day**? I've never heard something so fucking stupid in my whole life. Contact me again if you turn out to be right. I'll change parties.
c9gqq6n,aleisterfinch,This was a really calm and even-handed article for people to get riled over. I would go so far as to say anyone who gets their hackles up over this has emotional problems and likely a persecution complex.
c9gq8ab,denvertebows15,"No one is saying that you have to ignore the tragedy that took place in Boston. Asking people to think critically about the two situations is not a terrible thing. If we had more constructive discussions about the situations we wouldn't be in half the shit we're in now. I'm sorry but situations like this that create an atmosphere like we're more important than everybody else needs to be criticized and put into perspective. Its not about a competition about which one is more tragic. That's not what this discussion should be about. All loss of innocent human life due to wanton violence is tragic. It doesn't matter if it happens in Boston or a village in Pakistan. It can only help to give the American people perspective on what happens to the people we're ""liberating"". I love America as much as the next guy which is why we need some perspective."
c9gou7j,copperstar,"Exactly. It's not the American public that is doing this stuff abroad, nor is it just America. Why do people feel the need to lash our at the public? Is it any different than the UK and other NATO countries who are also participating in these attacks? And furthermore, aren't most of these ""suicide bombings,"" and what not in the Middle East caused by the terrorists themselves? And isn't there a difference between an active war zone and a public setting? I mean, it seems like people are looking for any reason to lash out at the American people."
c9gpaog,dulbirakan,"I think the author refers to drone strikes and other civillian casualities directly caused by American soldiers not just suicide bombers in Iraq. Those deaths do not just occur in ""active"" warzones, they take place in Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen etc. Of course Americans are entitled to their pain and they should feel bad for their fellow Bostonians. The hope in the rest of the world is that pain will allow them to emphathize with people of Iraq, Afganistan, Pakistan, Yemen and other places that have been targeted by US and through this empathy they can put an end to torture and killing carried out in their name."
c9gpdh7,copperstar,"Again, the majority of Americans don't support the wars, and that's one of the platforms Obama was elected on. Yet, all of a sudden we're ALL 'Muricans that want to, ""kill all 'em brown people.""This crying that Americans don't have sympathy is ridiculous.

All countries have lost lives due to another country's actions, or one group has lost lives from another group's actions. This whole, ""America, blah blah blah"" or ""Country Y, Z blah blah blah"" bullshit is tiring. You think America is the only country doing shit like this? If so you're horribly ignorant to the modern world of intelligence and politics. We're just the ones doing it most visibly. No one should HOPE that others feel the pain that they have felt. They should HOPE that no one ever again, feels the pain that they have felt."

c9gqqnp,wysinwyg,"Historical events aren't relevant. Drone strikes are a current event. There's probably one happening right now!Palestine/Israel. However that was set up, isn't it mostly perpetuated by American support of Israel?"
c9gr147,balletboy,"The conflict is perpetuated by Arab countries.Israel's ability to keep up with decades of Arab antagonism is the result of American support of Israel. But really, I disapprove of the founding of Israel (which was basically colonialism) and the current occupation of Palestine but to imply that the conflict continues because of the USA and Israel is disingenuous. Hating Israel is the closest thing most Arab countries have to a national *anything* and it very rarely has anything to do with actual opposition to Israel."
c9gr872,Hungry_Lion,It is caused by the borders drawn up post-WWII by the British not the US.
c9gx22x,wysinwyg,Yes I wasn't disagreeing with that.

c9gpie8,FutureInanity,"Do you think everyone comes together and picks out a spot for the war to be fought on? Honestly though, there is no war going on. We basically act as police.

You aren't there or involved in any way shape or form, so you just don't give a fuck about them."
c9gpwqn,copperstar,"Americans hate on cops for several reasons, but nobody would say they don't want police around anymore.When the people who attack and kill your innocents are harbored in a country, and you want nothing more than to get at the people responsible for the atrocities against you, than you have no choice but to go into that country. Pakistan has Taliban agents, that's where we found and killed Bin Laden for fucks sake. This isn't just the US, but the allies.I want us to get the men responsible for killing our innocent people. No different than someone who wants to catch a murder. I understand that there is a fundamental difference between a war zone and something like the Boston Marathon. I care about those people, and I don't to see them harmed. I want our troops to come back home, because I hate the fact that I lost people I care about over there. I've also met these people, seen the horror in their eyes. I don't resent them, but I understand that this is a hostile region, that even before the US invaded, people were dying."

c9gq0vs,,"By ""potheads"" do you mean over 50% of Americans?A large percentage of people want marijuana legalized for reasons other than recreational use. Our prisons are filled with non-violent offenders, a large portion for drug use. A huge amount of money is wasted on prosecuting/imprisoning these individuals. Millions and millions of dollars. Some people also use marijuana medicinally.I pray for the day it's legalized so our government can move on to bigger issues. In the meantime, ignorant people like you should do the shutting up."

c9gqd31,marinersalbatross,Yep.
c9gp9qk,,"And saying that we are responsible is a massive dumbing down of our political process and global governance. Nobody votes for leaders based on their promise to attack children in their sleep. Nobody votes for a leader because they swear to kill innocents that get in the way of our freedom. You're an imbecile to think for a moment that things are remotely that simple.The Germans didn't elect Hitler because he promised to eradicate the unclean and filter the world. They elected him because they thought he was their way out of other problems. They, much like us, ignored large portions of his platform and beliefs so that they could fulfill the promise of growth and revitalization."
c9gpjz7,,"And if we ignore large portions of a politician's platform because we're focused on other things, how is it not our fault when those parts do damage? We were clearly too negligent to pay attention to them."

We've strayed so far in the last century and we've become a victim of our own success. But to address your comment directly, the USA I still an amazing place to live and I won't trade it for anything. Taking my comments as anything more than what's written is an inference that should not be made. Loving your country does not require loving ones government."
c9gpzt3,rebootyourbrainstem,"Actually, Hitler's ideas about Nationalist pride and the need for an agressive attitude were very much a part of his popularity, because it released people from the desperation of losing a war and the crushing weight of punitive war repayments. The search for scapegoats and the casting down of others below the ""superior"" Germans fit fairly naturally with that. It was how the new government worked.The idea of the US as the ""world police"" may not be popular, but in the end I think the idea that no country in the world can escape powerful US influence does allow a lot of Americans (and other westerners, to be fair) to sleep better at night. That same projection of force has people from other areas cowering in their houses at night, hoping they won't get hit by gunfire or bombs. At some level we must accept that we apparently consider this necessary, that we believe we have a right to bring war to their countries, or at least that it is not important enough to get worked up over. At some level we consider these wars to be a normal part of how our government works."

Meaning that (at least in this case) democracy is ""working"" and the people are getting what they want. And to the original point, that ultimately the people are responsible in some way for the drone policy, and it's uses."

c9gpuet,,"We are not forced to choose between two evils, that's the lie we tell ourselves to maintain the illusion of being helpless. We vote in primaries before elections, we are under no obligation to vote for one of the two parties, we can run ourselves if we feel like it.Those options are only unrealistic because we don't believe they'll work and, afterall, we need so badly to feel that we aren't responsible for what happens."
c9gri0a,,You and me both think like that. We have the ability to do that we have the freedom to do that and when I vote I will do that. However.

c9gpeyk,SamuraiRafiki,"I don't think the US gets enough credit for the targeting and sophistication of our drone strikes. Hundreds of thousands of civilians died in our wars against Iraq and Afghanistan, because sticking tens of thousands of troops in an area and saying ""let 'er rip"" is a really inefficient way to get bad guys. Conversely, we've got flying robots piloted by guys back in the US that take pictures of the specific bad guys we want, then annihilate them from afar- no oppressive troop presence and deadly firefights required. And no NATO troops to be targets for terrorist attacks that claim bystanders as well. It's not like we're conducting a campaign of carpet bombing and shooting hellfire missiles into crowds on the off chance we get someone who doesn't like us. I don't like our drone program, but the reason I don't like it is because the CIA isn't able to be held accountable in the same way the NSA or Armed Forces are. If these were Air Force drones, I don't really have a problem with them. Also, if you're an American citizen living in Yemen having gone to support Al Qaeda, then by the time the hellfire missile comes through your passenger side window, you've had ample opportunity to avail yourself of your constitutional rights. If the circumstances of your supporting Al Qaeda or a similar terrorist group are sufficiently obvious, then I think the appropriate due process is the aforementioned hellfire missile. I'd like it if that process were more formal, but whatever formal process is implemented to green-light those attacks, it should have cleared that particular strike."
c9gqida,,"I do not give credit to the US for the sophistication of our drone strikes. We have killed children and 1st responders with our ""double tap"" strikes. We are not at war with Pakistan and Yemen - big difference, and that is why we are not carpet bombing them.The US has granted itself permission to kill any military age male in our strike zone. If we are wrong, and kill someone accidentally, we declare them innocent AFTER THEY ARE DEAD. See my source for details about how the ""Secret Kill List"" works.[source](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html?_r=5&ref=todayspaper&pagewanted=all&)"
c9gtgjc,SamuraiRafiki,"The US doesn't carpet bomb in either case; it costs more and is less reliable than targeted strikes from either piloted or unmanned aircraft. We're not at war with Colombia either but we have soldiers prosecuting the drug war with military aircraft. I don't think it's practical to declare war on Pakistan, Yemen, and half a dozen other middle eastern and African countries in order to send in drones. We're at war with groups within these countries that have attacked or intend to attack the United States or its allies. Absolutely, the program needs to change to be more transparent and have better oversight, but it's better than letting these guys go on their merry way, and waaaay better than putting boots on the ground."
c9gpqqd,arkwald,"Which is the main problem I have. We don't know why these things are happening other than the canned ""It's for your safety"" line of BS.Without accountability how is the CIA any different then these 'dangerous terrorists'?"
c9gtmsy,SamuraiRafiki,"The CIA is at least somewhat accountable because the director can be called in for congressional hearings. The problem is that the mandate of the CIA doesn't include killing, and the oversight of the program is minimal. That's why it ought to be turned over to the military so that there's more daylight and transparency."
c9hscag,ShroudofTuring,"Well, the drones are generally military assets 'sheep dipped' into the CIA. This has lead to some of the same oversight gray areas that were encountered with sheep dipped Air Force pilots and Army special forces soldiers in the 50s and 60s. The kinks in those cases were ironed out in the wake of the Church Committee, although as technology has changed they keep popping back up. Hopefully it's not going to require massive congressional hearings to fix this time, but that's very guarded optimism talking."
c9gqqbp,commodore32,"Drone strikes kills more than 10 civilians for each military target they shoot. In Pakistan thousands of civilians were killed by US drones.Drone strikes are more inhumane than troops. Since no American casualty is possible, controllers can be more aggressive and careless than soldiers on the field."
c9gtc1p,SamuraiRafiki,"I'm skeptical that the US is firing at targets in highly populated civilian areas; markets, apartment buildings, etc., so when you use the word ""civilians,"" I'd be more inclined to think that they're just ""proximate,"" which could include innocent civilians but could just as easily include nefarious characters who are not designated targets; drivers, couriers, soldiers, etc. Consequently, in Pakistan thousands of people were killed in addition to the targets, but to say that they're all innocent civilians is too pessimistic. In either case, surely the case could be made that soldiers on the ground- engaging in firefights and shelling and with helicopters firing thousands of rounds in dense urban environments- contributes to many more civilian casualties than comparatively precise strikes on specific targets. Of course it has to be more transparent and have better oversight than the CIA is capable of exposing the program to, but a rolling caravan of Humvees is much more likely to lead to casualties than a roving drone."
c9gpnqb,bigben42,"Yeah, I would venture to say that Drone strikes are far more humane than the old World War 2 method of dropping thousands of bombs on a city where there may or may not be military factories. Good thing they weren't fighting us back then."
c9gr4nk,Algebrace,If you were fighting the Germans again. Given relative military technology advancement... they would be using hunter killer robots with AI which were bi/quad pedal and wipe you out extremely easily. Then they would run out of resources and collapse.
c9grojt,Crisiss,"We wouldn't even need the bombs. Our military doctrines and policies have completely fucked us over. Especially the rules of engagement. Back then you could shoot a guy if he looked at you funny. That would get you court marshaled, fined, and jailed now."
c9gqab1,idunnit,"But what about the innocent people men woman and children that are killed in these attacks , it was just yesterday that Obama said that anyone who targets innocents is a terrorist. And i am sorry but one person in a crowd is definitely targeting a lot of innocents to die. And how do you know that all the targets are real terrorists or terrorist supporters, how many people have been released from jail in America because they have been found innocent after they have spent years in jail. And with so many attacks there are bound to be mistakes and those are the ones that cause the blowback that i prey Boston is not part of, co's if it is it will just give the warmongers the opportunity they need to cause more mayhem around the world in there fight against terrorism."
c9gtljv,SamuraiRafiki,"Your spelling and grammar make my eyeballs hurt. As to your points, the difference between leaving a bomb in a crowded area and firing a missile at a specific person is that the bomb in a crowded area is not targeted at anyone; it's a means to win a political battle by scaring the populace through mass murder. A drone mounted with a hellfire missile has a specific target, they know who they're shooting at before they shoot him, and then they send enough ordinance to definitely get the person they're aiming at, but not so much as to cause indiscriminate harm. Dropping a 500lb bomb would be terrorism, carpet bombing, war crimes, you name it. Firing a hellfire is a specific decision to kill that guy, with the unfortunate side effect of killing the ten guys next to him not because the intent is to kill 11 people, but to make sure that the one guy is definitely dead. The capacity for mistakes is exactly why we need better oversight of the program, but these types of strikes have the least collateral damage than any other method of getting the guys we want dead to die."
c9gpg2l,type1error,GG's point wasn't that you shouldn't feel bad. He was trying to use this tragedy to get people to empathize with victims of American bombs.

c9gppaa,bpj1805,"It's all a big chain of fucked up causality and illusion of control. Those ""terrorists"" executing those suicide bombings don't necessarily have anything to do with those prosecuting their grievances in other attacks. ""Terrorists"" are not an amorphous, homogeneous group of actors with a shared vision, shared goals, or even values. In fact that's the whole fucked-uppedness: [everyone thinks their in-group is diverse, but assumes the ""other"" is homogeneous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-group_homogeneity). So you get terrorist A attacking American civilian B for something that happened to Iraqi/whatever civilian C because terrorist D attacked American soldier E for being in Iraq/wherever. Then people everywhere assume that, in a form of ""my enemy's enemy is my friend"" logic, B and E are somehow directly responsible for each other's actions, as are A and D, and so more injustices get prosecuted to F, G, H and so on.But then again, you (collectively) *did* vote for the people setting your foreign policy, and they *did* fail to construct a just society by themselves.

c9gq0rl,copperstar,"The US just wants out. The numerous attacks that keep happening are only enforcing reason to stay and try and stabalize the region.

The whole point of the article is that we are not consistent in our application of empathy and outrage. We don't seem to recognize that the *same feelings* of grief and sadness and anger that we are experiencing now are experienced by people all over the world all the time. Just dwell on that for a moment, if you would. Forget the question of blame or responsibility. Forget trying to respond with a bunch of reasons why this article is wrong because ""suicide bombers"" are really the cause of all that violence.

Personally that would make me more likely to punch a hippy.Obviously there are exceptions, notably psychopaths who don't feel empathy, but I don't think the logic is flawed.

c9gqlr7,,A Chinese citizen was also killed in this attack. Is China now feeling the rage that the world feels towards them for artificially undervaluing their currency and mercilessly suppressing Tibet?
c9gr68h,,">mercilessly suppressing TibetTibet has been part of China for **far longer** than America was a nation, let alone colonized. So before you condemn China for continuing it's reign over Tibet, leave America or whatever European colonized nation you are from. Especially considering the genocidal campaigns against the Native population of America that lasted all the way up till around World War One, compared to the massive investment China continuously puts into Tibet, including infrastructure, schooling and hospitals. But if you want to be angry at China for something your Western Bias media is telling you to be angry at China then go ahead, the same way they told you Russia invaded Georgia for months, when it was clear through evidence and self admission Georgia attacked first."
c9gryf9,SongRiverFlow,"> Tibet has been part of China for far longer than America was a nationThis is debatable. Both Tibet and China have competing claims as to the history of China's sovereignty over Tibet, and at points in history Tibet even had sovereignty over certain areas of the rest of China. ""Modern"" Tibet formally became part of the Qing Dynasty in 1642, so actually not much longer than America has been a nation. Additionally, both sides recognize that Tibet was not under Chinese rule from the period of 1911 until the 1950s occupation under the CCP. > the massive investment China continuously puts into Tibet, including infrastructure, schooling and hospitals.China has also been responsible for massive destruction and violence in Tibet, particularly during the Cultural Revolution. Of the dozens upon dozens of monasteries before the Cultural Revolution, only 3 were left standing after the campaign. China has also reacted forcefully in response to the 2008 uprisings as well, as well as in response to other instances of protest. This is not to detract from your point about the genocidal campaigns of Native Americans, just wanted to offer some deeper insight into the China/Tibet issue. I find the the original comment a somewhat ridiculous parallel to the issue at hand, but to brush aside the issue of Tibet as a consequence of Western Bias is irresponsible."
c9gs8ne,,"> ""Modern"" Tibet formally became part of the Qing Dynasty in 1642, so actually not much longer than America has been a nation.One thing you should consider though, is that much of the US was taken by force in the 1800s.

c9gwhw2,Zenrot,"I forgot that because America is a democracy I have the power to bitch-slap President Obama and tell him to fuck himself, and personally sign the order to withdraw from foreign nations. Oh wait, I don't. I just vote every 4 years like everybody else does, and watch as our politicians continue to double-back on the shit that they do because they know people will vote for them if they lie. America has a fucked up political system, but that does not reflect on the common man."
c9gwmtl,Mathuson,Be more vocal about drone strikes. A lot of citizens support it currently. Also by democracy I mean it represents the majority viewpoint.
c9gwokq,Zenrot,"Yeah dude I'll call Obama right now and tell him that drones are bad. Again, you think the majority view-point is adequately supported by an election. Obama was initially voted into office championing the immediate closure of Guantanamo Bay. It is still open."
c9gwrmu,Mathuson,Thing is the majority is still content with their government.
c9gws0s,Zenrot,Because we don't live in poverty. I don't bathe in a river that people also shit in. I don't eat one meal a day so that my children can have 1.5 meals. Am I happy with how we act? Hell no. Am I content that I live in a country where my basic human needs are accounted for? Absolutely.
c9gwtrt,Mathuson,Well the majority is content enough to not care whether drone strikes are used because they are so removed. My initial point was kind of worded badly. To foreign countries that suffer at the hand of America's foreign policy compassion from American citizens is pretty meaningless to them.
c9gwvfc,Zenrot,"Compassion from us is meaningless to them, yet we're the ones that get their hatred. People don't say ""America's government is a puppet voting system built on money and lies"". People say ""Americans are stupid, fat, ignorant, and want to rule the world with their greedy fat hands.""I'm pretty poor, and I'm only a little chubby, so I don't find that fair."
c9gwwmq,Mathuson,Noone thinks that. People just think you don't care what your government does as long as your life isn't affected. And I am speaking in general terms.

We just never win."
c9gxjol,Mathuson,I guess its because the majority of the vote is not perturbed by drone strikes.
c9gwxr0,Zenrot,"I mean, realistically, I have almost no call in the actions of my government. I don't even keep up with it 90% of the time. I learned about the drone strikes by finally having some time to catch the news a few days later. We have college campuses around the nation packed with people just like me, striving to make enough money to live above the poverty line in a nation packed with people who want the same thing. My government can throw some bombs or whatever, I just don't have time to worry about it. I'm far too small a piece to affect the global chess board, and I'm not naive enough to think that I can."
c9gxk2u,Mathuson,So you agree with me. Compassion is pretty much meaningless to the people affected by drone strikes.
c9h7ajp,Zenrot,"I don't agree with that at all, it holds meaning because it is all we can offer. Shun it if you like, but in the act it is you who strip it of its meaning."
c9hab54,Mathuson,I'm speaking from the perspective of those who are being affected by drone strikes. They probably think the majority of people are at least indifferent for the government to even think ofbusing drone strikes.
c9hk7o5,Zenrot,Well sadly thats not how the government works.

People are acting irrational, why would you want them to try to do something that requires rational thinking?Honestly if your message is so bad the only way you can reach people is through emotion, then you need to re-examine that message. I think stopping war is something we can get people to want without getting mad at them for feeling sorrow for someone.People feel more sorrow for people closer to them. That's just kind of part of human nature. We're not like insulting the world because we feel sorry for our own. I'm sad for all of the people around the world who die every single day. But I think its bullshit to get insulted for caring about something terrible happening at home as well."

But as a person who's put in that time and effort too, we both know that that behavior is a rarity.The article is not about getting mad at people for feeling sorrow for their own; it's about raising attention to how little sorrow they feel for everybody else. It's easy to give a fuck about our own; giving a fuck about others is a more real measure of our character."

They're quoting the MSM, which is really owned by the same people who try to control all of the other information. I agree they did a good job selling Iraq to some people, but America doesn't act or think as one normally, and yesterday we finally had some good cooperation out of a tragedy. I'd rather put a little more focus on that then saying that we're angry, when I was reading about such kindness.Looking at the good of the world, then turning it would have been better. Basically, instead of just saying ""sure it was authentic, but... "" saying like ""Americans should treat everyone overseas with the same great shows of humanity and compassion that they're capable of at home."" I just think that this is only going to increase the partisan divides, and cause more bickering without a good outcome. Had they not followed it up with ""But it was really hard not to find oneself wishing that just a fraction of "" Maybe ""a big fraction"", or a ""large enough fraction"" but a fraction implies that none of us give a shit.

As a country we tend to find ourselves entrenched in a lot a wars (with heavy collateral) and in general the news does a terrible job of getting that back to us. If a drone strike kills 30 innocent people then there's no news report. If a terrorist kills 30 people in the same place we report the shit out of it. This creates a scenario where a large part of America is just not aware of the collateral created by the wars we are part of, and another part (as much as you don't want to admit it) knows and doesn't care."

But I'd bet a good amount of money that the person saying it - and the vast majority of other Americans - have no clue that targeting rescuers with ""double-tap"" attacks is precisely what the US now does with its drone program and other forms of militarism. If most Americans knew their government and military were doing this, would they react the same way as they did to yesterday's Boston attack: ""Idea of secondary bombs designed to kill the first responders is just sick. How does anyone become that evil?"" That's highly doubtful, and that's the point.That's not a practice we invented, one that I think is abhorrent, and one that more letters to the president from me won't solve.

Bush might as well have just been a member of al Qaeda, as much as his administration benefited that movement and injured America."

It has to do with the subjective feelings of those people being killed, whether its the tens of thousands at the hands of the US ever year or the hundreds killed by terrorists.

Its just a lot different when its an attack killing three people and then being emotionally manipulated about it by a media seeking to exploit a tragedy for money then when 10% of the people in your country are dead because you have oil. I think the latter warrants more rage."

I also disagree with the word never because its not true, as there are some that do. But how does that imply that all Americans are evil like your post stated he did? He's just saying we don't realize a certain thing. And considering how he's talking about empathy toward foreigners, how would your paragraph about helping fellow American's disprove his statement ? I apologize for the harshness in my original comment, but I don't see where you are drawing your conclusions from at all. It's like we're reading a different article.

Non-US people are upset about those killings though, but the majority of US citizens either rationalize the action or just are ignorant.

No, you ignorant, condescending peckerwood. Innocents dying in any attack is a tragedy and one I would prefer was 100% avoidable, but it's not. But the U.S. (and our allies, we do not operate alone) measure a mission by how few civilians are killed, terrorists measure it by how many. To compare the two is disgusting. Empathize with the innocents in Iraq/Afghanistan? Surely I do. Do you? When was the last time you sat down and thought about them, really? I ate and walked and talked with these people. I was in their homes. There were times I watched them die, just like there were times I watched ""innocents"" and ""friends"" pick up weapons against us. I am in no way suggesting that it makes misplaced attacks ""OK"", but there are no uniforms to differentiate a combatant from a friendly. You know who it was pretty easy to tell wasn't a combatant?

There have been talks in Washington regarding increasing border control and other such acts. This may be just a sample of the people, but it is an interesting sample. The article does lump together all Americans under the term ""the US"", but our media does similar things regarding, for example, Iranians, and Muslims. No one should write in such a way unless they have an agenda.

However, I can link you a fox news affiliated person tweeting about 'killing all Muslims because they are evil' and Arabic people being taken off an air plane, simply for speaking in their mother tongue. Last time I checked, people of various ethnicities are discriminated against very heavily in America. How about profiling based on skin colour and name at all US airports? You don't need straw-man and pitchforks to demonstrate hatred, America demonstrates it's hatred and more importantly, it's ignorance on a daily basis by how it treats people of different religions and beliefs. For instance try comparing the justice process for a white person and a Guantanamo Bay detainee, both only held on suspicions.While you may think that your religion handles anger better, invasion of Iraq would beg to differ. 35+ who died from an attack become your responsibility because your country went in and destroyed whatever Iraqis had. Was Saddam perfect? Far from it but Iraq deserved it's own Arab spring, not a regime change forced by another country who seems to think it is their duty to spread freedom, while they keep quietly curtailing and destroying the basic freedoms of their own citizens.In no way do I support the actions of the bombers but you hate them for leaving a pressure cooker bomb. Do you know that Afghanistan used to be a flourishing land where girls used to go to schools and the country prospered under communist rule! Do you also know that in order to foil the 'rise of communism', America armed and trained the early terrorists and sent them in to destabilise the government? That was a bomb America planted that has killed innocents everyday for over a decade! How about the landmines Americans left behind in Vietnam which still blow up underneath little children.While I can understand why you feel such articles and these people are pointing fingers at you and America, they are actually trying to tell you that they feel your pain and are hoping that you will be more empathetic when you hear that their children died in a drone strike conducted by America, and that you, an average American would find it unacceptable that your chief of staff can simply state that the children were at the wrong place at the wrong time and not even show a shred of remorse or sorrow because no one in America could hear the screams of those kids and their blood splattered thousands of miles away from your country."

The journalists don't get that - at all, as evidenced by the fact that they say these are the same emotions.

The article has very little to do with validating or invalidating particular emotional reactions and everything to do with universality and empathy. This is maybe *the* central line running through all of Greenwald's work. So his point wasn't that the US is failing to support the victims in Boston. His point was that the US doesn't respond in kind to tragedies *outside* of our borders, even (and especially) those tragedies that the US has had a hand in committing -- the very ones we should be MOST concerned with. As another commenter pointed out below, the following sentence summarizes the article's position well:>*""Somehow the deep compassion and anger felt in the US when it is attacked never translates to understanding the effects of our own aggression against others.""*So let's work through this:>I'm sorry but this is bullshit. What rage would you classify occurring on the streets of Boston? **Where did he mention rage ""on the streets of Boston""?

Is that the type of anger and rage you're talking about? **Again, no, it clearly is not.

He specifically mentioned those attacks in the third paragraph.** Fuck this article, and fuck everyone who likes to jump on this America is evil circle-jerk. **Your perceived ""America is evil"" circle-jerk doesn't exist.

That's the only point to be made here. It's wrong when a scary brown person does it and it's just as wrong when we do it.** You know what angers me, after spending 11 and a half months across the world drinking chai **sounds grueling** with Afghani, Egyptian, British, Australian, Canadian, and Romanian soldiers all talking about how we hope we made a decent dent in the horrible shit that takes place every fucking hour in that region I get to come home and read on the internet that it doesn't even exist and we just made it all up. **What doesn't exist?** Fuck me, right?*"

c9gzdku,ProfessorD2,Didn't say either is okay.But there is no comparison.
c9hay9f,ChoppingGarlic,"You just compared it right there. Such a pointless thing to say ""no comparison"".Just because one thing is bad doesn't mean that everything has to, does it? So why aren't you concerned about the innocents in this case? How would you react if you had an airplane turn around just because people felt bad about having you on it, just for racist reasons?"
c9hbefw,ProfessorD2,"How would I feel? I don't know.What I do know is I wouldn't start cutting off innocent people's heads.I wouldn't blow myself up, much less blow myself up in a busy, public area.And that's the point. Our rage may *feel* the same, but feelings don't mean shit. We don't judge people by their feelings. We judge them by their words and deeds.And when it comes down to it, the American reaction to rage is superior to the Arab reaction to rage."
c9hbr3s,ChoppingGarlic,"You are doing the same thing again, you are implying that all Arabs cut peoples heads off, and blow themselves up, which is **not true**. Only certain extremists do that. There are extremists everywhere and anywhere.There are American extremists as well, ever heard of those? There are for example American soldiers that get away with war crimes, just because it would be too much shame in bringing it up to the public (see wikileaks helicopter video for example).I do not believe anyone here is actually speaking about some kind of murderous rage, it's just that people have certainly felt rage over this issue, and people feel the same way in places where American intervention has happened. Which **almost always** have lead to much greater casualties than this relatively small attack, which hasn't got any link to any Arab country anyways.You could argue that the ""American"" reaction to ""rage"" is war in the middle-east, no matter who, or wherever the cause of the ""rage"" came from. So is that a greater reaction than killing (some would call) invaders of their country?You are jumping to conclusions that aren't logical or reasonable, and frankly misguided."
c9hj85x,ProfessorD2,"> You are doing the same thing again, you are implying that all Arabs cut peoples heads off, and blow themselves up,I said no such thing.However... it is impossible for an American to travel to the Middle East without constant threat of violence or death. My family recently went to Rome, Israel, and Egypt. Only in Egypt did they see people laying dead in the center of town as cars continued to drive past. Only in Egypt did they have to bribe police and soldiers throughout the day just to get from Point A to Point B without being harrassed. Only in Egypt did they have to hire a bodyguard with a loaded uzi to keep them safe as they visited the tourist sites. Mind you... this is all in the commonly traveled tourist areas. I can't imagine what kind of shithole the rest of the country is.Are ""all"" Arabs going to cut people's heads off? No. But there isn't an Arab country where this isn't a serious, realistic, daily concern. The same can not be said of Western countries. I do not believe the European/American ""race"" is superior to the Arab race. But I'm quite certain the European/American culture is vastly superior; how we handle our rage, and how we treat visitors, are just two examples."
c9hq8u2,ChoppingGarlic,"Fair point. I have visited many of these countries including Egypt as a Swede. But I have never encountered any real threats (I would think that It's hard to tell a Swede and an American apart in those parts), so I'll just have to believe you.You do have a point, as I know that it's dangerous to go without a guide of sorts, and you should only be out during the day (in Egypt). So yes, it's not the most welcoming place on the planet. Sometimes I've worn a T-shirt with the Swedish colors on it, just to differentiate from Americans. So I'm with you there.It really does suck that you can't visit the Middle East without danger put upon yourself. There is of course a logical explanation for this, which is the point of the headline above."

c9ifptb,ChoppingGarlic,"I'm going to admit to over-exaggerating your response at first, but my problem was your phrasing. In the same way your original comment was a bit of an over-exaggeration as well.The phrasing that bugged me was ""rage"", even though it might be hard to find a more fitting word. That made the implication that everyone had the same sort of rage in that culture, even though a **lot** of people from the Middle East try to flee their countries because of the most represented mindset. The ""strongest"" mindset (because the other ones aren't represented, since they don't make much noise) is a sort of ""middle ages"" mindset, where intruders and women must die if they don't agree with their crazy ""holy"" rules. There's many atheists and calm religious people in the Middle East, but they get killed (in some of the countries, not all) if they release that information. So they either play along to keep their heads, or they run.The invasions aren't clear to have left a positive impact, as there is as much terrorism as ever there. When one leader is thrown from power, it's usual to have a worse one take it's place. However that is another discussion.What we both have in common is that we believe that it's dangerous to travel those parts of the world. Maybe for different reasons, but not too different.I would say we have some kind of an understanding now, and I'm happy we understand each other.10/10 *would* argue again!"

I understand that we were not in active ""war"" against Pakistan, but again very few people would disagree that he was a Military, and appropriate, target.Also, while Americans may have hated the death of soldiers during the Iraq war by the Iraqi military, or soldiers during WW2 by the German military, few would call those terrorist acts by the Germans or Iraqi, or assign them the same moral blame as a purposeful attack against women, children, and civilians."

c9h1w2c,baconhead,According to the report you linked they were firing weapons into the air. Now I understand that it was ceremonial but that makes it a huge difference between bombing a marathon deliberately and misinterpreting small arms fire as a threat.
c9h4055,i-abide,"let me ask you something: do you think firing a rifle into the air could take down a plane? a standard rifle, fired upwards, taking down a military aircraft more than 10,000 feet above it. do you think that's possible?"
c9h42m3,baconhead,"Yes a rifle can take down a plane. The altitude is irrelevant because you don't know what altitude they were operating at. Regardless of whether the fire could cause actual harm, the fact that it appeared that there were people firing weapons aggressively would justify an air strike. It's very unfortunate what actually happened but again, you cannot begin to compare these two events."
c9h6214,i-abide,"guess what, i'm comparing them anyway and drawing my own conclusions. i will not be barred from thinking certain thoughts. even if civilian Afghans had access to military sniper rifles, the [maximum effective range](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper_rifle) they could achieve would be a little under two miles. military aircraft can surpass an altitude of over [50,000 feet](http://www.ehow.com/how-does_4569969_high-plane-fly_.html), or roughly 9.5 miles. an altitude i assume they would occupy when flying over hostile territory. so even if Afghans had access to the best guns out there, they still wouldn't come close to hitting our military aircraft. do you think our military would be stupid enough to fly at such a low altitude that their aircraft could *be* hit by a rifle? the truth of the matter is that the threat was negligible/nonexistent. we attacked in response to the perceived (imagined) intent of those on the ground, not in response to any actual danger. ""oh it *looks* like they want to hurt us. they can't. they're pitifully under-equipped to actually hurt us. but it *looks like* they want to. so fuck 'em."">Regardless of whether the fire could cause actual harm, the fact that it appeared that there were people firing weapons aggressively would justify an air strike.how does one fire a weapon non-aggressively? with a come-hither look? are you prepared to live under the same standards you impose on others?"
c9h72yd,baconhead,"It doesn't matter what the ranges or dangers involved were. If I see people shooting weapons in Afghanistan and I know they're not my own side's I'm going to assume that they're the enemy and kill them. Why? Because that's what happens in war. War. See that's what separates Boston and Afghanistan. One is a war zone, and the other is a city with a marathon. So you can't compare them, no matter how hard you try. I'm not infringing on your freedom or what ever the hell you think. It's just a fact. >how does one fire a weapon non-aggressively?So you're justifying the air strike too?

c9gsi6i,i-abide,"hmm, i think i get what you're saying. intent is the difference between manslaughter and murder. what about systematic manslaughter? if we know there is a high possibility for fatal accidents, does that still mean it was (technically) unforeseen and therefore not as bad? edit: well.. does it? SOMEONE FUCKING ANSWER ME. y'know what?! IT DOESN'T. IT FUCKING DOESN'T. WE'RE GUILTY BY NEGLIGENCE. i fucking love you America, but LOOK AT IT. LOOK AT REALITY. YOU KNEW THE WHOLE FUCKING TIME THAT PEOPLE WOULD GET HURT AND YOU DIDN'T GIVE A SINGLE FLYING SHIT. you double-thinking mental acrobat. LOOK AT IT."
c9h2glf,Arcturus2,There's a thing called cost/benefit analysis that's relevant to this discussion.
c9gqs6r,infected_goat,"I'm not going to say much... as I believe anything I say will simply be misinterpreted either by accident or on purpose... So I'll just say this: Maybe if Americans witnessed the violence done on our behalf, as we see the violence here, we wouldn't be so violent."
c9gtf9o,swakawakaflame,"Thats one of the problems. The media is so restricting when it comes to graphic images of war, but they don't hesitate to put pictures of civilians in the Boston bombings with their legs blown off, covered in blood. The government doesn't want images going around that make people anti war. Vietnam for example..."
c9gtial,infected_goat,"Exactly, I'm not going to take a position except one: confront your choices and live with them. If we can agree that the cost of war is worth it, that's fine, but we should have to see what that cost is."
c9gywk6,watchout5,>The media is so restricting when it comes to graphic images of warPart of that has been the disgusting culture we call our media. It's all about access. It's all about brown nosing. It's all about shock value. There's also this atmosphere that they'll lose coverage of the white house if they cover it in any possible negative way. It makes me feel really good for ditching cable all those years ago. Worst waste of money in my life ever.

Sorry, mate, but thus article has a point.It's not saying we can't mourn, it's not saying we can't be mad, it's simply saying let this be a wake up call for all the textbook counter terrorism the U.S. has been implementing.I get that you are angry. I am, too. But what our drones do overseas is just as awful.I love America, but I won't call her beautiful when she's at her ugliest. Even when it burns me up inside with shame."
c9guvpf,Thor_Odin_Son,"You seem to have missed his point. The article implies that we pour out hate when we're attacked. That may sometimes be true, but it sure as hell wasn't that day. That was the point, your response seems to have gone off on a tangent within the original comment. He mentioned the strife in the middle east, yes, but the main focus was on how the citizens of Boston (as well as those who do not live there or even in the US, but were there that day) acted. To clarify: Have the discussion you're looking for, just know that it isn't of the most relevance as it pertains to this particular comment."
c9hclzq,CardsLafter,I see.I misunderstood and apologize. I did not interpret intent correctly.
c9gtgmi,,Would you tell a family in Pakistan that lost a son in a drone strike to harden the fuck up because more people just died in a bombing in the US? You wouldn't because that line of logic is fucking retarded.
c9gtrrw,smoonc,"We already tell them that... in fact, that's exactly our justification for the drone strikes in the first place. So I agree, that line of logic is ""fucking retarded"" as you say, but it's apparently the one we're pursuing."
c9gu030,Beetle559,"Now you see how absurd the lines of reasoning ""it's war, civilian deaths are unavoidable"" or ""there will always be collateral damage"" in justifying US missile strikes is right?Right?"

c9hcjcz,CardsLafter,"O.o No, I'd never say something like that.And yes, yes it is.... Are we discussing the same thing?"
c9gqx4p,pgc,"You missed the point of the article, my friend. Of course most of the reaction towards the Boston bombing was compassion, not violent rage, but there *was* rage. And if this kind of bombing happened on a weekly basis, it's not hard to imagine the rage growing, encapsulating more and more people as more and more victims are created. The areas of the world who hate us don't hate us out of a fad; it's because they've been attacked by our military. Innocent civilians and their families. That's what the article is trying to say"
c9gsjnh,lowrads,"Don't get me wrong, I think the writer of the article is as much of an asshole as the rest of us. Do I think we're evil? No. Are we foolish? Yes.We should make steps to return to a pre-WWII America. Much of the rest of the peoples of the world won't learn anything if they don't suffer a bit, and they won't act like adults if they don't stand on their own two feet. There is truly fuck all we can accomplish if they aren't interested, so we might as well just protect an amazingly implausible means of existence in the history of our species and document it thoroughly. If the rest of the world says, WTF?, then just point out that they could have it too if they wanted it bad enough to change themselves. Historically, we have a shitty record for changing the world, but we have a really fucking good record at getting people to want certain things."

c9gusmb,Phantai,America=/=AmericansAmerica is the country. The government state composed of an executive branch and a legislative branch that makes foreign policy decisions on the behalf of its constituents.
c9gut9n,Scabdates,so what you actually mean is the American government
c9gvkx3,Neverborn,"We live in a representative republic. We, as a nation, decide who the American government is. We are just as much to blame as they. Especially when we keep putting them back in power."
c9gvlro,Scabdates,And if we're lied to?
c9h7yx2,LDL2,A better question might be if you are one of 49% who didn't authorize those actions should the hatred come back to you. Well do you support a system that uses 51%?
c9gvnw7,Neverborn,We have a responsibility to use the mechanisms that exist to remove the liar from office. The fact that we don't simply means we're too lazy to care enough. Every office has conditions for either a recall or impeachment.
c9gr9fu,ammonthenephite,"Well, as they see it, we know what our government is doing and we just keep on paying our taxes. World is a messed up place though, no one should have to suffer like this foreign or domestic.Edit - to those downvoting, you have to admit that you do know what our government does abroad, and you continue to pay the very taxes that make it possible. Whether you agree with what our government does or not, each of us are in part responsible because we foot the bill for it every year. Those on the receiving end of those drone strikes, occupations and regime changes know this."

And the attendees of the marathon, and the people working at the WTC, and the people of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, and everyone, everywhere, who have been embroiled in conflict that they do not understand, let alone feel passionate about. Yeah, yeah, yeah...to those of you who say, ""Civilian casualites are a reality of war.""I completely agree. And that's why, when the drumbeat starts pounding for war (declared and undeclared) I stop and ask, ""Why? Why are we doing this? Is it an absolute necessity?"" And if it is, if it is completely unavoidable to go to war. If going to war means less casualty in the long run (and sometimes it does). Then I hang my head in deep sadness, and want to slap the shit out of the flag waiving pricks that that celebrate the occasion with false patriotism."
c9gtkpp,Hocks_Ads_Ad_Hoc,"You're very pompous. Have you ever wondered what it is like to be a 19 year old going into a combat zone? Sure there are plenty of people who wave the flag for attention. A lot of people wave the flag because IT HAS TO MEAN SOMETHING. The fear, separation, the loss of first world amenities like cooked food. Sure nationalism is a crutch, but sometimes people need crutches."
c9gueje,oddlogic,"You're statement is ridiculous. False patriotism would be celebrated by those on the sidelines, not by the young men whose lives are wagered by their seniors for causes they don't fully understand."
c9gv6qy,Hocks_Ads_Ad_Hoc,"I believe mauxly was implying that patriotism itself is false. If that is not the case, then what exactly does false patriotism mean and who are the people that are falsely patriotic? Does everyone who tries to show support to military members by telling soldiers that their country is something to be cherished and protected qualify?"
c9hjrhk,oddlogic,"I think you're reading too much into it. I have no idea how old mauxly is, but when I was young we were going into Iraq for the first mission, Desert Storm. People were wearing t-shirts about bombing Hussein, about what a badass country we were, etc. It was an abomination that a 13 year old has a hard time wrapping their head around. To me, that is the notion of false patriotism. The notion that your country's military is doing the right thing, all the time, simply because you lie under the ""curtain"" of said nation. It is the blind assumption that war is good, right, and just because you fall under the border of the dominant military power."
c9hlew0,Hocks_Ads_Ad_Hoc,"That's not even about patriotism though, any more than cheering your favorite sports team is civic pride. I feel like its uncharitable to view these people as abominable. Misguided and foolish but not abominable. They are just weak people who want to feel/appear strong even if its by proxy. I remember the leadup to Desert Storm as well. I think I was only around 7 and so most of that stuff blew over my head. In fact, my biggest memory of that war was watching a TV news story featuring a soldier/father returning home and the big scoophug he gave his kids."
c9gsl1a,Erotic_Asphyxia,"I've always hated the world casualty. There's nothing casual about killing someone, or dying."
c9guxlf,fortcocks,Casualty means both injured as well as killed.
c9gutiv,myerscc,"If it makes you feel better, apparently *casual* used to mean ""by chance"" and that's what the word ""casualty"" derives from.Not that deaths in war aren't deliberate. But it's sort of a toss-up between who gets to live and who has to die, I guess."

The second any of it actually touches your soil you are outraged and indignant. Its one thing to be angry but to say they are ""wrong"" in some moral way for fighting back is beyond hypocritical. But thats the US so what do you expect. 3 die and its a national tragedy 70k die in Iraq and its a joke on South Park."
c9gr8yt,mauxly,"You have a point, and yet, you are part of the problem. This shit only creates more of this shit.We lost 3 Americans. Great, someone out there feels like there's been a little bit of justice. Do you know how many people are going to die because of this? The 911 attacks. Remember them? There were people out there cheering over the death of Americans. Great. But that attack lead to both the Iraq and Afghan Wars. The civilian casualties from that dwarfed the pain that America felt that day. I don't know where you are from, but if you were in the USA, you'd know that there are a whole lot of people here fighting to prevent America from going to war, with everything they have.And every time there is an attack on American soil, the Peace Movement is crushed under the weight of American anger. The truth is, if we keep getting attacked, Americans will freely give up their own lives and liberties (liberties which are critical to fighting this shit from the inside) to go back and slaughter who ever attacked us (and, unfortunately, they'll slaughter way more people that had nothing to do with the attack). People who commit terrorist attacks only strengthen and embolden the very people they are trying to stop. So, if you want the carnage to continue, go ahead and encourage and support these attacks on us. I, I live here, and I want the carnage that we commit overseas to stop. So I'm going to fight both of you, the terrorists, and the military strategists, with everything I have."

What the U.S. did in Latin America is mindblowing. In the Southern Cone the CIA's [Operation Condor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Condor) put people like Pinochet in power, filled the entire area with right wing ""anti-commie"" military dictatorships and killed dozens of thousands of people; a bit to the North in Central America and the Caribbean they backed the mafia like actions of the United Fruit Company, that terrorized dozens of farmer indigenous villages so Sally and Johnny could eat bananas and apples cheaper. The sad thing is that this isn't a ""thing of the past"" there is [written proof in the form of official documents](http://consortiumnews.com/2013/02/21/how-reagan-promoted-genocide/) that during Reagan's administration the ""national security team"" approved the extermination of the ""leftist guerrillas"", and action that ended up with the destruction of dozens of Maya villages.

c9gwbfr,,"I don't agree with that, and the fallacy you're perpetuating with your comment is old and overused. In a democracy politicians are the direct product and latent reflection of the population, because that population chooses them and generates the political climate for those parties and ideologies to exist, interact, grow and take power. We are not talking about an oddity here, like for example Hitler's rise to power, which occurred under a general period of massive economic or social crisis, but about a sustained century of electing one after another politicians who were and are jingoistic domestically and extremely aggressive against resource rich countries externally. Either be it because of laziness or general lack of care the U.S. people are responsible for their government's attrocious nature or the U.S. isn't a democracy at all"

You just don't understand that most of the times America does something, it does it for self benefit; and that there are many people worldwide that suffer for the stuff your country does, how it does it, or what it doesn't do in the name of its own self interest.PS I am NOT saying that I judge America for acting in it's own self-interest. I also do think that, as a whole, America has and does make the world a better place. I live in Canada so this is especially true for me.The only thing I take issue with is that Americans themselves don't realize WHY their country does what it does, or that the effect of 'mericas actions isn't as cheery as your crap media outlets like you to think.

Wow.Please read up on some basic background in foreign policy before ever making any further comment on foreign policy.The US (specifically Woodrow Wilson) invented the concept of altruistic foreign policy. It is in fact [referred](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations_theory#Liberalism) to as '[Wilsonian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilsonian)' foreign policy. People hate the US because we have ocellated between this idealistic ie '[liberalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations_theory#Liberalism)' that the US invented and pragmatic '[Realism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations_theory#Realism)' that everyone else has consistently followed. It is more accurate to say that the **lack** of US self interest has been the catalyst for wars rather than self-interest. In short please aquire some basic knowledge on a topic before making bold unsubstantiated assertions.PS Here is the 'logic' behind the Iraq war in case you were interested in reading an informed source:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterrence_theory#United_States.27_policy_of_deterrence"

Wow no way, what a horrible place. Facts are when bad things happen in the world everyone cries for America to help. Not Canada or anywhere else. You have that luxury of being able to sit there are judge how and what gets done. This article is bullshit plain and simple.

We spent nearly 10 years rebuilding their country and they still have water and electricity issues daily. The city of Baghdad is divided with concrete walls segregating neighborhoods and people with such detrimental effect that our ""ghetto's"" look like resorts in comparison.At some point we have to take accountability for our actions, regardless of motivation or justification. I would highly recommend you watch the Documentary ""No End in Sight"" and ask yourself if this belief holds true...>If the United States ""has and does make the world a better place"" what right do you have to spew hate towards it?Do we make it a better place?

The UN was involved, other UN countries were involved, the Iraqi government was involved, the Iraqi people were involved, heck, even the number 400,000 is in question. Maybe you've never spoken with Iraqi refugees that said the UN sanctions weren't enough, and had petitioned the UN to intervene with peacekeepers to prevent Saddam from regaining power after the Gulf War.Feel free to continue with your *ad hominem* attacks, but you'll be hard pressed to be taken seriously using two logical fallacies as the basis for your claims.

His successor resigned for the same reason. The head of the World Food Program in Iraq followed them. Even if the US was 10% responsible for sanctions that we pushed for, that means we still killed at least 40,000 children. And that means the whole 'we don't target civilians' is bullshit, because for sure we didn't think it was Saddam who would starve. We are the cause of sanctions that resulted in the death of 400,000 children. We pushed for it. And we intended for civilians to be the target, it wasn't Saddam that was going to starve. So how can people ask why terrorists blow Americans up and how they can target civilians while at the same time nonchalantly blowing all those deaths off, and even saying that people wanted it (same way that people wanted Stalin to starve 20 million people, I am sure a few people stood to gain). Saddam's genocide of the Kurds didn't kill even half as many people as our sanctions. The mental gymnastics you play to take the sting off 400,000 death children dwarf any rationalizing terrorists have to do.. they've never killed that many people. I think terrorists are bastards, I am just marveling at how big of a bastard you are. And jingoism fits you perfectly: it's the macho attitude that our presence is necessary anywhere and everywhere and that we can do no wrong in foreign policy. That's exactly you, who else would say Iraqi's actually wanted for 400,000 children to die."
c9gvxrk,Thundercracker,"You're joking right? Seriously, you should tell me if you're just trolling or something. The sheer amount of logical fallacies and outlandish baloney you're pulling out of thin air here is just astounding. You must live in one special little bubble because reality is quite different out here in the real world.You throw out numbers like 10% responsible = 40,000 children murdered, but that has no basis in reality. The idea that you could even assign responsibility like that is ridiculous, but to then associate that with a number just further removes your argument from logic.Arguing that the US (especially the US alone) is responsible for these children's deaths is also ridiculous. You seem to imply that the US set out to kill these children, which is blatantly false. You have no evidence for it, there's nothing to back up your claim. Feel free to provide some evidence if you're going to try to make it.Firstly, we know that the UN passed resolution 660 by a vote of 14 to 0, with one abstaining. You want to blame the US for a vote that was essentially unanimous? Try 14 different nations at least. It was Iraq who then refused to comply, so give them a large part of the blame in continuing this chain. Then the vote on sanctions was again 13 to 0, with 2 abstentions. Note no votes *against* here. The resolution was reaffirmed later by 12 nations with only Cuba voting against. You see, in the real world, the UN steps in when a country is violating the Geneva Protocol, but perhaps you don't care about the use of chemical weapons. Would you argue that the nations of the world shouldn't step in when they know a country is using chemical weapons like Iraq was? Perhaps you think the part where they were gassing Kurds and such is fine. We know that Saddam's regime was responsible for the deaths of at least 250,000 Iraqis, his own people. We know he was deliberately committing genocide (not just having someone resign and suggest it fits the definition) of Kurds estimated between 50,000 to 200,000. There was the Halabja poison gas attack that killed 5,000 and maimed or debilitated another 10,000. Estimates of up to 1,000,000 dead during the Iran-Iraq war. These are all before the UN resolutions too. There's the fact that Bush may have been swayed into taking the stance against Iraq by Margaret Thatcher. Note that it was also partly the fact that the Soviets worked together with the US. The trade sanctions were meant to remove the ability for Iraq to continue using chemical weapons. We know that Hussein himself claimed that the sanctions worked for disarming them, whether his son-in-law claims they were hiding extras or not. The Oil-for-food program largely benefited the Russian state, not the US. Most importantly, we know that approximately 60% of the Iraq population relied on the food program of the Iraqi government. The same government, and probably the same people, that had been responsible for the deaths of 250,000 Iraqis already. Their food program gave only 40% of the required calories per day. Do you really believe that the government, noted for terrorizing/killing it's own people, was doing everything it could for those people? The idea of it is ridiculous.The reports of the number of deaths also vary greatly, even as low as 170,000. Some reports say that the lack of change in Iraq's population growth over the period suggests the sanction death toll reports are much *lower* than reported. In the northern regions which were autonomous (that is, with less of the Iraqi government) the infant mortality rate *declined* due to better food allocation. David Cortright, American scholar and peace activist, said >""The tens of thousands of excess deaths in the south-center, compared to the similarly sanctioned but UN-administered north, are the result of Baghdad's failure to accept and properly manage the UN humanitarian relief effort.""This points the the responsibility largely being with the Iraqi government itself, which was known for terrorizing it's own people and having been responsible for 250,000 of it's people.The fact that you try to imply the US pushed for sanctions to target and murder 400,000 children is just you using scare tactics and faulty logic.The fact that you continue to try to insult me, calling me a ""bastard"", trying to apply the 'jingoist' label, just shows you are grasping at straws. You are throwing out ad hominem arguments and using the logical fallacy of false cause. These remove your credibility. You are not using critical thinking skills.I suggest you re-evaluate your claims and try to apply some more logic and evidence. Even if it means you won't be able to spread your fear-mongering and hatred."
c9gw47r,tsk05,"Entire first paragraph ad hominem, then go on to accuse me of using ad hominem. >You throw out numbers like 10% responsible = 40,000 children murdered, but that has no basis in reality.Uh what? 400,000 = 100 percent, therefore 10 percent = 40,000. Basic logic. You keep insisting that even though we pushed for these, because the UN consented that means not all blame is on us. I agree. So I took some absurdly small fraction considering the entire thing was our idea and pointed out that even if that's our portion of the blame, we are still mass murderers and we still deliberately targeted civilians. And afterward, we didn't say like you suggest ""oops, it was an accident, we fucked up"", instead we literally said on national television, using those exact words: ""it was worth it."">You see, in the real world, the UN steps in when a country is violating the Geneva Protocol, but perhaps you don't care about the use of chemical weaponsOh, a country violating the geneva conventions. How horrible! Let's write sanctions against the civilian population that we know will kill people (and end up killing 400,000 children). Oh wait, the sanctions were kept over a decade after end of the Gulf war, and most of the children died long after it ended.> We know he was deliberately committing genocide That according to your own numbers resulted in 1/8th to 1/2th the number of deaths the sanctions you are defending now did.>Estimates of up to 1,000,000 dead during the Iran-Iraq warThe Iran-Iraq war that the US greatly desired, the one where we propped Saddam up, gave him large amounts of monetary and military aid?>The reports of the number of deaths also vary greatly, even as low as 170,000. The majority of the reports are 400k and greater. Even at 170k, that's still more your own numbers for the Kurd genocide you cite. >The fact that you try to imply the US pushed for sanctions to target and murder 400,000 children is just you using scare tactics and faulty logic.Who were the sanctions targeting? Saddam was going to starve? No, we wanted to get to him through civilian suffering. And that ended up killing 400,000 children.. THEN we went on national TV and literally said ""it was worth it."" What excuse are you going to come up with for that? Was it worth it, killing all those children? And as for ""Saddam probably killed his own populace"", yeah, what a coincidence that even though he had been in power for a decade before and all statistics had been rising, as soon as we passed our sanctions people started dying. [That cliff-like drop off after a decade of Saddam's rule and rising numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Iraq-infant-mortality.png) exactly where the sanctions begin is just a coincidence. These are estimates of deaths from sanctions (see the reports), not from Saddam starving anyone - you pulled the latter from your ass."
c9hahl0,Thundercracker,">Entire first paragraph ad hominem, then go on to accuse me of using ad hominem.I'm afraid you're wrong here, do you know what *ad hominem* means?Also, placing % blame and assigning death toll numbers like that is ridiculous. If the supreme court makes a ruling you don't assign percentage responsibility to the justices. The whole point of the UN is that all the countries who vote in the issue have an *equal* responsibility for the *entirety* of the action. I guess you would simply have let Saddam continue to manufacture and use chemical weapons on whoever he wanted? Would you like to see some pictures of the children he was using them on, or do they not matter to you?I think it's funny how you conveniently skip over the point that destroys your whole argument. Lancet and UNICEF studies showed that infant mortality **decreased** in the northern UN-administered region. That's right, *decreased* compared to then Iraq was running that region. So let's see, where the UN was in control, mortality rates decreased. Where the Iraqi government, which we know to have terrorized and murdered it's own people, was in control of feeding said people, the mortality rates increased. Gee, I wonder who bears the responsibility there?But of course, it's far more beneficial to your strawman argument vilifying the US if you blame the Iraqi starvation of it's own people solely on the US.Also, for the record, you shouldn't use a quote based on another logical fallacy, the loaded question, in your argument. It just continues to prove you have no credibility."
c9hbre7,tsk05,">I'm afraid you're wrong here, do you know what ad hominem means?The entire first paragraph and another paragraph at the end are the most blatant ad hominem's possible.Your Supreme Court analogy falls way short. If one judge brought the whole case up and then pressured that all the other judges should agree, that judge would bear the majority of responsibility. That's why as I pointed out earlier Wiki calls with US sanctions against Iran is exactly that: US sanctions against Iran and it notes that the US pressures the international community to agree.With regard to chemical weapons, the entire Kurd genocide does not reach the death toll of our sanctions. It does not even reach half.As for infant mortality in the northern region, the studies found it decreased between 1994 and 1999, when most of the deaths had already occurred. The by far sharpest increase in clearly visible [in this graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Iraq-infant-mortality.png), and it occurs in 1990 when the sanctions were implemented. It almost evens out in 1994 after the huge plunge before. You throw your claim out there as if children started living more in some regions after our sanctions, whereas in reality incredible amounts died and then there was a very very slight decrease from the appalling amount that child mortality had fallen to after we implemented our sanctions. In 2005, the child mortality rate was still over 3 times what it was in 1990, and a [recent UNICEF study](http://www.unicef.org/media/media_66724.html) found very little improvement; that's over a decade after Saddam has been removed. Additionally, the regions Saddam administered were poorer and far more damaged in the war. And Wiki notes that it was much easier to smuggle things into the UN administered region as well. But this period is well after the majority of the deaths occurred, and even that ""increase"" pales in comparison to the plunge that we caused right before that. It's not a coincidence that the 3 people most directly responsible for distribution of food in the UN sector quit after the first said the program amounts to genocide."
c9hc3ak,Thundercracker,">The entire first paragraph and another paragraph at the end are the most blatant ad hominem's possible.I think you may need to relearn what ad hominem means.Your claims that the US is to blame for it all is just more of your strawman argument trying to vilify the US, when instead it's the UN council as a whole that bears responsibility for the actions.I find it amusing that you defend the use of chemical weapons in the Kurd genocides because you say it didn't kill as many people. I guess we should have let them keep dosing children with mustard gas? I mean, there weren't as many deaths so that was okay, right? lolThe fact remains that where the UN was responsible for the region, death rates decreased. Where the Iraqi government was responsible, death rates increased. Your graph doesn't make that distinction, which is why you cling to it so desperately. You cling to the fact that 3 people quit and claimed it was genocide, but you ignore the additional comments right after that: However, Sophie Boukhari a UNESCO Courier journalist, reports that ""some legal experts are skeptical about or even against using such terminology"" and quotes Mario Bettati: ""People who talk like that don't know anything about law. The embargo has certainly affected the Iraqi people badly, but that's not at all a crime against humanity or genocide.""You see, you pick and choose the bits of evidence which support your strawman argument against the US. You defend the use of chemical weapons on children as not being as bad. You ignore what the Iraqi government did to it's own people. Textbook cherry-picking."
c9hciw1,tsk05,"US bears the majority of responsibility, having proposed the sanctions and done the convincing that was necessary to pass them. You can keep denying this basic, obvious, fact but it only takes away from your credibility. This simple assignment of responsibility occurs in courts each and every day. I am not defending Saddam's use of chemical weapons, but rather pointing out that it killed less than half the people we did. Doesn't really make sense to say ""buuuut chemical weapons"" and then kill twice the amount of people, does it now.And that ""fact"" is totally false. There was a HUGE increase in death rates for the ENTIRE nation in ALL regions from 1990 to 1994. Then in the North, there was an increase from the appalling numbers it fell to."
c9hmz3n,Thundercracker,"Just because you claim the US bears the majority of responsibility, doesn't make it true. It just helps out your strawman argument. In fact, your argument is quite literally a strawman; rather than assign responsibility to the entire group of people that enacted this motion, you choose to single out and burn the US because it suits your goals of vilification better.It's pretty convenient that you simply rewrite reality to suit your point, especially when you're downplaying the purposeful genocidal use of chemical weapons. That's really the first time I've ever seen anyone try to downplay genocide, or chemical weapons for that matter. Would this be the part where you start calling names like ""bastard""?Was it the goal of the sanctions to kill anyone, as you suggest? Of course not, that's a ridiculous claim. Though, I do like the part where you cling to your 400,000 number when the estimates vary wildly.The fact is totally false? Do you happen to have some evidence on that? [Here's some evidence showing it's true.](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673600022893/abstract) From the 1999 survey:>**Findings** In the south/centre, infant and under-5 mortality increased during the **10 years** before the survey, which roughly corresponds to the period following the Gulf conflict and the **start** of the United Nations sanctions. Infant mortality rose from 47 per 1000 live births during 1984—89 to 108 per 1000 in 1994—99, and under-5 mortality rose from 56 to 131 per 1000 live births. In the autonomous region **during the same period**, infant mortality declined from 64 to 59 per 1000 and under-5 mortality fell from 80 to 72 per 1000.""This is based on a survey on the years **1989** to 1999. This would include the 1990 to 1994 period where you falsely claim ""ALL regions"" suffered.Care to use some *actual* evidence, or just continue cherry-picking and/or lying?"
c9hrojm,tsk05,">Just because you claim the US bears the majority of responsibility, doesn't make it true. It just helps out your strawman argument.Right, the country that pushed and pressured for the sanctions bears the same responsibility as all the other countries. As for Saddam's chemical weapons usage, yes, I am totally downplaying it by pointing out that it killed half the people our sanctions to supposedly stop it did. Your point makes no sense: 'look, we did it to stop Saddam from killing all those Kurds.. by killing twice the amount of people he did.' For varying estimates, I like how you use Lancet and UNICEF data for your claims of regional improvements, but when they both report over 500,000 deaths they are suddenly unreliable. How convenient. The majority of estimates are 400,000 or over, that's a fact. Even the lowest estimate there of 170k is still equal to how many people Saddam killed in his Kurds genocide. Doesn't make sense to stop a genocide by doing another one, does it.As for values, LOOK AT THE FULL REPORT. Page 4. You can clearly see that for both of them the under-5 and infant mortality rates increased between 89 and 94. You know what else you can see in the report? An explanation for why they think the North fared better in latter years and it's exactly what I said before:>The region also has a less severe embargo as itcontains most of the country's rain-fed agriculture andhas borders with neighbouring countries that are moreopen than those in south/centre. The “Oil-for-Food”goods have been distributed more rapidly, the per capitaallocations from the programme were set 22% higherthan in south/centre and the cash component of theprogramme assistance in the autonomous regionequivalent in value to 10% of all goods. In addition,many more non-governmental organisations (34,compared with 11 in south/centre) are present.23 Allthese advantages in the autonomous region comparedwith the south/centre have contributed to a decline ininfant and under-5 mortality."
c9kthna,Thundercracker,"I see you gave up in the face of reality. I guess your strawman couldn't stand up to logic?Tell me this genius, what would you have done? Would you have let Saddam continue to use chemical weapons on innocents? How big a death toll is big enough to do something about it? Or do you not have an answer for that because it doesn't involve trying to vilify the US?I love the parts where you completely ignore any involvement by the Iraqi government."
c9izij7,Thundercracker,"And yet, you still have yet to prove evidence of the US pressuring and pushing that you claim is fact.You also downplay chemical weapon use and try to claim that the sanctions were intended to kill people. Where's your evidence that this was the intent?Your quote just proves my point; where there was a smaller Iraqi government presence, and more non-governmental organizations, the situation was far improved. AKA the Iraqi government didn't have as much opportunity to oppress it's people, which we know it was fond of doing.Really, you're just an Iraqi government apologist trying to demonize the US."

c9gqv5j,Armadillo19,"One thing is not mutually exclusive to the other. I don't understand why whenever something happens, people try their hardest to try to point things out that they feel has never been pointed out before (not saying you, but this article). We fucking get it already. Every time something bad happens in America, we don't need to be reminded of ""well you know, America caused a lot of pain in the rest of the world"". No fucking shit, but one thing does not necessarily have anything to do with something else, and showing sympathy for one another in America does not mean that everyone has just forgotten about the rest of the world.I specifically took some time out of my day to think about what happened in Iraq, and try to make a point to keep things in perspective, and I think a lot of people are very cognizant of the fact that the United States has not been a perfect utopia, that many unjust things have happened at the hand of the United States, etc.Does that mean that we shouldn't be able to express sadness and sympathy when something terrible happens in our own back yard? Is that somehow a slight to other people around the world? I say fuck that. One thing does not discount the other, and constantly bringing it up is ridiculous - one thing doesn't have anything to do with the other. Furthermore, it's not like Boston went ape shit and started lynching Muslims. In fact, the majority of the rhetoric I've seen online and on the news has been suggesting this is right-wing extremism of some sort, and there has been very little Islamic bashing (and rightfully so, as that is some massive bullshit).I'm sad for Boston.

And people who have been struck by lighting. People who have gotten in car accidents.

Muslims, Jews, Christians - Americans, Iraqis, Tibetans, Australians, Congolese etc etc etc etc etc? It is a sad reality that death and violence are so prevalent. I'm most certainly not trivializing the deaths of anyone, but I think that the rationale is that in some of these places - parts of the Middle East where an active war zone has been present in many countries for years, where the entire region is regularly undergoing instability, failed revolutions, massive oppression, or Africa, where unbelievable genocides have been committed and where horrible human rights violations happen regularly, it just doesn't come as a shock. Sure, the media is insane and distorts reality with reporting practices. At the same time, should someone in Mongolia be criticized for not getting as emotional about the Boston bombings as someone living in Connecticut? I think that's pretty much human nature. Is someone in Ecuador at fault for caring more about cartel related violence outside of Quito, as opposed to those killed in Iran/Turkey this morning due to the Earthquake, or a family killed in Pakistan by a suicide bomber or drone strike?People care about their own first and foremost - they always have and they always will. I don't think it's a purposeful slight, and I certainly am not saying that we should just forget about others across the globe who are suffering, but I think that people getting criticism for showing support to Boston is really ridiculous. Should we have to put a disclaimer before every conversation ensuring that we promise we're not forgetting any of the hundreds of millions of people afflicted by violence and wars?

c9gwu8o,ERK754,I'm pretty sure that rage your talking about is directed at the chucklefuck who wrote the article and not at random Muslims who haven't done anything. Hell we don't even know who did it yet and everyone automatically assumes its Arab extremists or another group that hates America
c9h1hnj,tsk05,"He's talking about rage directed at the person who did this and those who would support that person; you saying there is less of that than directed at the author? Give me a break. The point of the article is whatever rage people feel toward the real culprit is the same rage people in the countries we bomb and kill feel toward us. It's not a ""don't rage against random people"" article, which you'd know if you read it."
c9h1sqq,ERK754,"I read the goddamn article and I understand the US inflicts collateral damage in other countries, but we wouldnt be fucking launching missiles at them if they didn't kill our people out of pointless hate."
c9h4vde,tsk05,"Somehow I am not surprised that the most enraged people are the ones that don't feel the slightest shred of empathy for those we are killing. By the way, their pointless killing might have something to do with our two invasions, or maybe with the 400,000 children in Iraq we killed with out sanctions less than a decade before. It's like that enraged them the same way the Boston attacks, which killed far fewer people, have angered you. To you we better keep bombing until they stop killing our people, and to them they better keep killing our people until we stop bombing theirs. And most on either side don't feel anything for the other, so they don't understand any of the motivation."
c9hfq1k,ERK754,Yeah it's almost like the world isn't fair and it sucks and so many people die for no goddamn reason. Fucking pardon me for siding with my own country
c9hkz8h,tsk05,"When you say ""no goddamn reason"" you mean ""because we're bombing and killing them, and have been for decades?"" I mean what does it take to realize that maybe we should stop bombing them and then they'll stop bombing us?Here is US history in middle east: 50s: We overthrow Iran's president and install a dictator 70s: Iran overthrows dictator 70s: We fund Afghan rebels after Soviet Union is invited by Afghan government to oust them. Some of the winning rebels eventually form the Taliban. 80s: We fund and arm an Iraqi newcomer called Saddam and encourage him to attack Iran because the latter is quite hostile to us now that its overthrown our dictator. Over 1 million people die in the war 90s: We implement sanctions against Iraq when Saddam no longer plays ball with us and decides to invade Kuwait. Over 400,000 children die from sanctions, about 50,000 people die from the war. 2000s: We invade Iraq to finish off Saddam 2000s: We invade Afghanistan to finish off the Taliban See how we created our own problems and why people there don't like us? How about you side with your country and stop voting for the people who are creating these problems for us."
c9hlccu,ERK754,"Now you see here's the problem with your ""if we stop bombing them they'll stop bombing us"" view. It makes total sense, but it will never happen because neither side will stop. This is why I say ""no goddamn reason"" because it's all just stupid political bullshit. Yes we did all of those things nobody can deny it but when does it end huh? We are gonna keep protecting our interests and people are going to keep hating us because of it and rightly so. The world is a fucked up place to live and there is no right way to do anything. On a personal level I care about nearly every single person (and when I say nearly I don't mean not people from ""so and so country"" or any specific race or religion, I mean scum bags and the like) but when it comes to politics and war the best you can do is to protect you and your people regardless of who started what and who is justified in doing whatever."
c9hlwsp,tsk05,"Neither of us can protect ourselves from anything like Boston, or any other terrorist attacks, so why not recognize and tell others to recognize exactly what Glenn says: the anger we feel at the killings is the same anger those in other countries feel at our killings and we should all vote to stop that. How does falsely saying 'oh I don't understand why those savages do this and fuck all of their people, let's keep bombing them' do to protect us, exactly? The best way to oppose what's going on and to stop it is to spread the exact message that Glenn spreads. Any other message (like for example anger at bombings combined with saying oh how dare those savages do this for no reason) only gives our government more ability to continue these attacks, and thus creates more terrorists."
c9hm9bb,ERK754,The people who say they don't know why this stuff happens are a bunch of idiots or blind patriots and part of me agrees with what you say and another part knows it won't happen because we have no reason to stop because we get more than we lose and I hate it
c9h4ziu,PDK01,"*If* the bomber turns out to be from Iraq, Yemen, Pakistan or some other nation the US bombs, would you allow them that same defense?"
c9hfnd0,ERK754,You see that's a tricky question because you can't really tell when the cycle of attacking each other REALLY began or ended so basically what your question means to me is if we will allow them to continue that cycle. Yeah no. Also I think there is a clear difference between attacking a suspected terrorist or military target and the explosion hitting the building across the street and putting a fucking bomb in a pressure cooker at a charitable marathon with the intent of killing Motherfucking non-combatants

The scarier question for me is if that is what we as a species actually desire, or if we indtead find some kind of sick meaning in divisiveness, xenophobia, and power struggles. Humanity is so strange."
c9gy91v,aBrightIdea,2003 was 2 whole years after 2001. There were million man marches against the war in Iraq before it started. Yes the majority supported it (barely) when it started but to say that it was a direct reaction to September 11th or saying there wasn't time to argue against it is just false.
c9gssrf,,"What I said has nothing to do with justifying invasion and was neither pro- nor anti-American. I am complaining that people **use** a tragedy like Boston to complain about American overseas actions when in fact the tragedy in Boston **something completely separate** as far as we know.

I'm also very outspoken against American policy, in pretty much every case.. that's not to say I don't empathize, but I care proportionally to the amount of people who died in the bombings in Iraq on the same day, which got little coverage.."
c9gxpdv,,"And they were idiots. The difference is it **was** completely appropriate to criticize US foreign policy after 9/11 because OBL explicitly stated that was his reason for orchestrating the attack. If and when we determine that the same motive was behind Boston, then it will be appropriate as well. But as it stands now, it is completely unrelated as far as we know, and I find it repulsive that people are trying to ""cash in"" so to speak on the sadness and mourning and redirect it towards victims of other atrocities."
c9gspnv,aureon7,It is true that there is no indication that the Boston incident even has foreign implications but having an unfortunate tragedy like this occur does not give a nation a free pass to avoid scrutiny. The point that many people are trying to make is that similar situations to this have come about as a result of American interventionism and are trying to show people what it would be like to walk a mile in the other sides' shoes. As these events are (thankfully) so rare it is a rare chance when citizens of a first world country can experience such emotions.
c9gtcsr,,"I am not advocating a free pass against scrutiny. I completely understand the motives, and you have just explained it very clearly--- there is a ""strike while the iron's hot"" mentality. What I object to is not scrutiny, but this very evident **increased** scrutiny during these sorts of crises, which I feel is disrespectful to the victims and unabashedly opportunistic, regardless of the strategy's efficacy in raising awareness of salient issues. Some feel the ends justify the means, but I do not approve of this sort of behaviour."

This IS an opportunity to bring things to the attention because the possible outcome is so beneficial for everyone. The victims should not and hopefully never will feel disrespected. The most vocal critic of american trigger happy foreign policy feels just as much empathy and solidarity with them as anyone. Now, while it's still unknown who the ugly scum was, is the right time to evoke empathy for the victims of the american activism. After the perpetrators are found all the emotions will be directed at them and the moment will be over."
c9gunid,anlin_wang,"Political opinion? My criticism of killing innocent civilians is now just a political **opinion**? I'm an opportunist when I see that the only time people are actually giving a shit about bombings is the only time people even will consider all the **civilians** we have killed in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen? ""all we know is some fuckin' sick assholes did something horrific to innocent men, women and children for fuck's sake.""That is precisely the point of the article. That is all that the survivors of U.S. attacks know. Why would you ever give a shit about someone's other positive motives when you know that a bomb could drop out of the sky without a moment's notice? The outrage is mutual, although one may be easier for us to identify with."

It is an opinion that I happen to agree with, but an opinion nonetheless.And yes, it is opportunistic to use people's sadness about these events to bring attention to other issues. After 9/11, criticism was appropriate, since US foreign policy was the explicit reason for the attacks. As of now, we have no idea why Boston was attacked, so to try to divert the emotions surrounding it to other tragedies is selfish and disrespectful. I see it as akin to approaching a woman at a funeral whose son just died from AIDS and saying ""Listen, you know how shitty you feel right now, let me take this opportunity to tell you what is going on in Africa and why you should feel bad about that too."""

Better to talk about it now than before some country has already been invaded or a bunch of new laws have already been passed.

Better to talk about the possible reasons for the attack now and think about how we ought to react if and when new information comes forward.

There is never a wrong or premature time to consider the big picture, and anytime we lose sight of that to ""focus on mourning"" or whatever we risk losing sight of it (as America has done so very many times in the past)."
c9gzypb,,"No, it is premature because there isn't any big picture yet. We have no information about who the attacker(s) were nor what their motives were, so no, I don't think speculating has any value here. Until there is some issue to discuss, the only thing people should be saying about Boston is how horrible it was. There is nothing to discuss at this time... so we should not blaming it on U.S. foreign policy, blaming it on God's anger at gays in America, blaming it on Islam... etc etc"

This is the most dangerous time to marginalize rational discussion in favour of emotion."
c9h4727,anlin_wang,"Hahahaha there's nothing wrong with using the opportunity to increase her awareness of what can be done about it but they WAY it's done obviously matters. You probably shouldn't tell someone why they should feel bad; more effective would be telling her how so few people have access to AIDS medication and the cutting edge innovations being made in its treatment. In the Boston marathon example, we have a rare opportunity to talk openly about the fuckedupness of bombs. The way I see it, there are few things more important that saving innocent lives. And thus, since we are currently **bombing** civilians, then the appropriate course of action is to try and show people that the grief and fear they feel in the aftermath of a terrorist attack is shared by many around the world who happen to be victims of American attacks."
c9gsvq8,creepy_doll,"This is a bullshit argument. There was another article posted here recently after Margaret Thatchers death and the immorality of criticizing her after her death. Essentially pointing out that if during a time of tragedy something becomes immune to criticism, it makes for an ideal situation to push through their views. This is the exact same. If we say ""We must stick together and show our support to the american people"" all that will happen is getting rights and privacy further torn apart.As horrible as it may seem, even at a time like this, people must remain vigilant. There is nothing wrong with showing both sympathy for the victims and criticizing the media and/or administration for its handling of it.Remember also, there are countless people taking this as an **opportunity** to blame it on muslims/arabs, or treating it as an **opportunity** to erode Americans rights."

Secondly, it was not a large explosive object... it fit in a backpack.

Sneaking through a crowd and putting a bag in a garbage can beside unarmed civilians doesn't take a whole lot of balls, it's pretty much the most cowardly way to kill people.In contrast, the terrorists of 9/11, they snuck knives through airport security and onto a plane, killed people in hand to hand combat, hijacked planes, and piloted these planes to their deaths. That is an example of something that took an incredible amount of balls. I definitely could not do that. But the Boston attack? Give me a fucking break... if you think that took ""tremendous bravery"" then you are a gigantic pussy, as I already stated.Cowardnoun1. a person who lacks courage in facing danger, difficulty, opposition, pain, etc.The Boston incident was the actions of a COWARD, who chose to avoid facing danger, difficulty, opposition, and pain in his attack.>When please say out loud that every soldier who pilots a drone or launches missiles, or shoots somebody from a mile away is a coward.

c9gy9du,,"Ok, fair enough, allow me to retract a bit of that comment and clarify. I wasn't intending to say that we shouldn't criticise foreign policy, or be silent about it during times like this. It's the increased discussion of foreign policy coinciding with this tragedy. What I take issue with is only articles like this, that attempt to capitalize on the sadness and emotion of the Boston events to bring attention to things like drone attacks in pakistan. As far as we know, they are separate issues, so to try to hijack the public feeling and redirect it I feel lacks class. Criticize the US all you want. But to have an attitude of ""see how it feels! Taste of your own medicine"" in order to express your opposition to policies is, in my opinion, inappropriate."
c9gyy3j,,"I think the point of these articles, is to give some perspective. The act in Boston was a dreadul crime. It is being used to whip up an atmosphere of hysteria, a Saudi man was wrongfully accussed by much of the media as being a potential suspect etc. The point is that the crimes committed by Washington on a weekly basis, including the drone bombings of civilians in Pakistan go largely unreported. The tragedy in Boston is being given blanket coverage, both to legitimize an increase of the powers of the state, and to whip up all sorts of unhealthy sentiments."
c9gzr2n,,"Alright, let me be very specific about what I take issue with... I have no problem with criticizing the tendancy of the public to go into anti-muslim hysteria. That shit disgusts me. I have no problem criticizing that this crime may be used by certain interests to push through questionable increases of authority and whatnot. What I do have a problem with is using this as an opportunity to complain about the underreporting of other world events. I just consider the timing insensitive. People are mourning dead in Boston right now and articles like this are trying to exploit that emotion to draw attention to tragic events elsewhere. Yes, I get that the US public isn't well informed about the crap their gov't is doing in the world and we ought to try to remedy that, all the time. But I simply feel that this increased attention right now and ""strike while the emotional iron is hot"" mentality to draw awareness to foreign policy issues during a time of grieving is disgracefully opportunistic."

Let's not blame any group without cause and let us also mourn for the people who die needlessly in all countries."
c9gx8k2,NetPotionNr9,People like you **never** find it appropriate to criticize our psychopathic policies? Because you're psychotic.

c9gy3vl,,"Firstly, it's completely ironic that you're saying to quit the heartstring tugging because that is exactly what we are discussing and what I'm complaining about being exploited. And secondly, the public is mourning."
c9gvwxc,,"YEAH!When WE kill innocent men, women, and children, we're being the superheroes fighting for the motherland. When THEY kill innocent men, women, and children, they're evil bastards who we need to kill innocent men, women, and children to fight against.Hey guys, don't you love torture? We should totally torture someone over this. How about we kidnap another Canadian? We love torturing those guys. (Man, I'm so glad we're the good guys)"
c9gxmxs,,You're a complete moron. That's not even remotely my perspective.
c9hamb1,,"Perhaps I'm a complete moron, but you'll have to explain to me how you can condemn one atrocity but attack others for condemning another, exponentially larger atrocity.It looks like some sort of reverse ""At least I'm not Hitler"" defence: ""Well, sure there are tens of thousands of innocent people who have been killed senselessly because we shot them and killed them, but that guy killed about 100 people!"""
c9hbqvb,,"You're presuming a lot of things about what my views are. I don't disagree that other atrocities are occurring in the world and I'm not attacking anyone for having opinions about them. Similarly, I am not defending US actions oversees. I completely agree the US foreign policy ought to be heavily criticized for the large number of fucked up things the US military has done over its history.The issue that I am complaining about is when this sort of criticism and scrutiny **intensifies** precisely during times like this when the American public is suffering and mourning loss. People try to exploit the sadness and emotion and redirect it towards these other atrocities around the world because it's easy. It's an opportunistic way to scalp and divert some of the attention from Boston and move it towards those other issues that don't get enough attention.Imagine a mother who had a son who just died from AIDs... at the funeral someone is coming up to her and saying, ""Well, I know you're sad, but you just lost one son, really. People are dying from AIDS all the time in Africa because they can't afford medicine. Let me tell you about blah blah blah"". It's completely lacking in taste and just plain inappropriate.If you want to talk about civilians dying from drone strikes in Pakistan, then I fully support you spreading that info and raising awareness and campaigning for change to reduce the harm being caused. However, do it some other time and don't shove it in my face while I'm busy trying to mourn something else. That's what disgusts me. I hope I've explained myself."
c9hhg13,,"You're right. Let's ignore the shitty things we do, so we can instead focus on what's important: Which innocent men, women, and children we're going to murder in retaliation for this heinous attack!It's tasteless to point out other things that are bad during a funeral, but getting ready to kill innocent people in the name of your dead family, that's totally kosher."
c9hndw0,,"It's like you didn't even read my post. Did I say anything about murdering innocents or getting ready to kill people in retaliation for Boston? Why don't you calm the fuck down, stop assuming I'm a warmonger, and have a rational discussion about the arguments I actually made. Or better yet, don't bother."
c9ifnej,,"the problem is that you are reasonable and I am reasonable, but you and I aren't the people being criticized.There is no choice, somebody is going to use these deaths to push their agenda. I'd prefer it be the people with basic humanity rather than the monsters who will use this chance to kill political enemies damn the collateral damage and take our fundamental freedoms.The only thing required for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing. complacency in the face of such is counted as implicit support."
c9gw0y8,springy,"Well, attention is diverted constantly from the terrorist atrocities committed overseas by the USA. Few Americans are at all interested in, or even aware of the fact, that at least one million completely innocent civilians have been murdered during the US war of terror in the middle east. Of course, selfish Americans will see the bombing in Boston as a far more newsworthy even. Yet, on the global scale of daily atrocities, it was a minor event."
c9gzce2,LocalMadman,3 people died. Sorry but that's not a tragedy.
c9gzzsf,,Every innocent death is tragic.
c9h02kd,LocalMadman,Just because death is tragic doesn't make this a tragedy.
c9h0tzk,,You're honestly trying to say that a psychopath killing a fucking 8-year old child is not a tragedy.... how many kids does a bomb need to blow up then to constitute a tragedy? 2... 10... 500??
c9h2qz5,LocalMadman,">You're honestly trying to say that a psychopath killing a fucking 8-year old child is not a tragedyNot when we kill more everyday under the guise of ""The War on Terror."" I find the reactions to the bombing more shocking than the event itself. I look at the pictures of dead muslim kids killed by our drone strikes and then I look and Boston and go ""meh"".>how many kids does a bomb need to blow up then to constitute a tragedy?This is beside the point, so I'll just say the square root of -1."
c9h2qam,,"Don't bother answering my question, easier to just downvote me, pretend to yourself that you didn't make an idiotic comment, and move on. Have a good day shithead."
c9h2vc5,LocalMadman,I did respond. Here's another response: You're a small little person with a tiny mind unable to understand the world around you. If you took time to educate yourself and not just shout down anyone that disagrees with you maybe you'd be a happier person. Right now you're just the loudest asshole in the room.
c9h3fa9,,"You're the only asshole here, trying to devalue the death of a little boy simply because he's American. I understand the world, and know what's going on around me. Maybe you should educate yourself and think about why it's a ridiculous position to pick sides and say the death of a child in pakistan is more significant than a death in America. It takes a truly tiny mind to brush off the slaughter of anyone and say ""meh"" simply because of your political views. I'm not shouting down anyone who disagrees with me. I'm shouting down a complete moron who believes that what happened in Boston wasn't a tragedy. Over a hundrede injured... loss of life and limb of innocent civilians. And you don't think it's a tragedy simply because this shit is perpetuated by their gov't and commonplace in other countries. You are a small little person and deserve a slap in the face for your lack of empathy and respect for the value of human life regardless of nationality."
c9h45jb,LocalMadman,"FYI, I'm an American. Your argument is invalid."
c9h4ju8,,Which argument is invalid and how so? I didn't even mention your nationality nor mine because they are completely moot.
c9gt6sp,bobbybouchier,I wouldn't mind if the criticism were accurate.
c9gwvhs,Shippoyasha,"First off, critiques of a nation should always be a thing especially when it leads to warfare. That said, comparing and weighing multiple instances of death across different nations doesn't make much sense to me as in that both are travesties and both should be worth the fury of everyday citizens.Speaking of citizens, that's another thing as well. Wars, especially not superpowers of this world are waged by the common people. It's waged by politicians and leaders. It would be absurd for anyone to presume that everyday people aren't outraged about the death of Afghans or Iraqi. But alas, the silent majority is overruled by the louder voices of the warmongers and racists."

c9gqpgu,BrahCJ,"3 dead innocent civilians should not be used as leverage to gain shielding from criticism. 31 people died at a wedding in Afghanistan from a strike yesterday. The time for criticism is now. Directly after the event, and onwards."
c9gr0zx,,"Also, two minutes of research revealed that your story about the wedding bombing was from 2002. It's being paraded around in the aftermath of the Boston bombing, as you can read about [here](http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/LeZqTy9bEZ7kjGPJxSGhtK/The-Boston-bombings-and-the-hoax-report.html)."
c9gr2r0,BrahCJ,Doesn't that make if more shocking that we're only hearing about this now?
c9gr7j3,,"The reason I looked it up was because I remembered a similar story from a while back. Couldn't tell you how much coverage it actually got at the time, but I explicitly remember reading about it in my hometown's paper. Also, I'm not part of your downvote fan club."
c9gre1a,BrahCJ,"I consider myself fairly ""onto it"" when it comes to matters like this. Mind you, a decade ago I wasn't so much. Not oblivious, but not active in my research. I sure as hell don't remember 24 hour coverage of the event though. In light of your findings, in fairly appalled that they're using that event as a platform to be vocal. The point at heart stays true to me: a life is a life, American or Afghani civilian. The media don't value these two the same. Whatever sells, right? Also, I don't enter in discussions in the chance of winning internet points. I think they're great for gaining knowledge and understanding of complex matters. While I still wholeheartedly agree with my initial point, I learnt something important today. Worth any amount of internet points!"
c9gqypz,,"Great, but don't use the Boston tragedy as a platform for that criticism, as this hack of a writer is doing. These are two separate, individually awful events."
c9gr3xv,BrahCJ,"I can respect your line of thinking here. To me, the journalist is only using Boston as all important context. But we can at least draw a line there I suppose."

c9gqbjh,sje46,"People always act like this in regards to the ""over-dog"" of sorts. Whatever country is the most powerful will get shit on unfairly. Which *would* be fine if it were just limited to foreign-policy, but *constantly* I see people shit on American culture and Americans as stupid, uninformed, overweight barbarians. People completely ignore the problems that happen in Europe and completely focus on problems the US have, which spreads the myth that Europe is a utopia. People bitch about American culture even though they have imported that culture themselves in many ways (there aren't many countries that don't have jeans or reality shows). It just gets annoying seeing fifty Europeans on the Internet--on reddit, Youtube, IRC--say ""typical American"". Or instantly assume all American music or television is worse by default. But no one ever talks about, say, the huge racism mostly ignored in europe, or general apathy in Europe about loss of freedom of expression.And then whenever a legitimate tragedy happens on American soil, *they* decide to politicize the event. In other words, it's Fuck-With-USA-Day and everyone's celebratin'.EDIT: I'm not talking about any person or group of people in particular...just the disgustingly smug exploitations of this tragedy I've been seeing all over the web as an excuse to discuss Americans as if *those* people ever gave a shit about Yemenis either. Hint: they didn't."
c9gsrm5,Osiriskiller,"Encouraging empathy = politicizing when it makes you feel bad I suppose. Yeah 2 people died horrible tragedy, literally.

c9gx6xv,TheSupremeAyatollah,"'Huge racism' in Europe? Please, just because some may perpetuate ignorant lies against your country, that does not allow you to do it against others. I know you have been reading the occasional TIL post or world news about France, but do not make the mistake of basing your opinion of an entire continent in such limited information. I am a Black man who has lived in the UK my entire life and never have I been the victim of or have I experienced racism. Let's agree that we both want the fair and equitable truth about the world, and we shall find it together. Not by treating countries like sports teams, not by making incredible over generalisations like you have just done, but though reasonable and honest debate. Let me begin: In my country Blacks and Whites live together on the same streets, their children go to the same schools. There is no ghettoisation or economic segregation of races. The prison population is representative of the population at large. Unlike in America where one million blacks are in jail, most of them for non violent crimes. Now which country is more racist?"
c9gti69,swakawakaflame,"So Europeans are speech restricting racists. I understand what you're saying, and I am American, but you kind of contradicted yourself."
c9gtr5a,sje46,"No, not all. But it's interesting how little a lot of Europeans care about freedom of speech laws, and also scandinavia can be quite racist.But not all or even most. I don't stereotype. As I said, I'm not talking about any particular group in mind. In fact, one *person* I had in mind while writing my comment was actually a person from India."
c9gw6mm,chachakawooka,The racism is Europe? I guess record once again you mean that French burka issue which has nothing whatsoever to do with religion or race but is purely about women being submissive. As a European I do see the scandals; but America has torture camps; uses cluster bombs that are banned by the majority of the international community. A cluster bomb knowingly kills civilians and does little of anything else. That is terror.

I'm not blind, I understand what happens overseas and it is tragic, but there is no correlation between American soldiers sadly killing civilians because of accidents and a maniac blowing up civilians on purpose."
c9gx051,Leaves_Swype_Typos,"""Accidental tragedies"" is not the problem. The military has collateral damage considerations. There are consistently times where a target's value outweighs estimated collateral damage, and we/they knowingly kill civilians. It is not always accidental, it's taken into account as a cost of doing business. Also factored in is the risk to American soldiers, which is part of why drone strikes have become so favored despite the obviously greater collateral damage they cause compared to risking soldiers. Our people are worth so much more to us than theirs are to us."
c9gw4uc,jrriddle,"And the pipe bomb was directed to kill hundreds of innocent men, women, and children. While the drone, is directed towards targets that may or may not involve collateral damage.

It's not always America's fault but to deny our part in this violence is the worst kind of denial. It doesn't mean America deserves 100% of the blame, but fuck me for wanting to remind people that violence breeds violence.

c9h78ix,yetkwai,"Ahhh white man's burden. Saddam Hussein isn't responsible, he's just an Arab, and we can't expect them to do anything but kill people that are distinct from them. The Entente powers knew that an Arab would do this (I mean what else can we expect from them, right?) when they formed Iraq. So really it was them that are responsible. I mean surely we can't place responsibility on anyone other than white people, because we all know we can't expect the lesser races to do anything other than massacre each other.You do realise how racist your argument is, right?"
c9h8le4,berylthranox,"The only person that is exhibiting racism here is you. I never said anything about racial inferiority among different Arabic ethnicities. The Entente powers denied Kirkul and Mosul to Turkey to prevent them from having the rights to the oil fields there. The ethnic groups located in those areas, which have a history of being the subject of persecution, are made part of a nation that eventually develops a ruler who massacres them. If you need to use racial inferiority to alleviate your guilt over western responsibility for international situations then I pity you for your struggles with racism."
c9h9jbo,yetkwai,"Yeah and Turkey treats Kurds really well don't they? Why is it so hard to just simply say ""Saddam Hussein was a bad person?"" Why do you have to shift responsibility to people making decisions 60 years before it happened?This is exactly the white man's burden argument. You are arguing that Saddam Hussein isn't responsible. Why? Because it's predictable that an Arab nation will eventually massacre a minority. Why is it the Entente powers should have predicted this? Your argument is that this is what we should expect of Arabs. And that, my friend, is racist.Do you also think that the US should be held responsible if another massacre occurs in Iraq 60 years from now? I mean, it is predictable that the ethnic groups ""in those areas"" get massacred, right? So only a benevolent white super power can prevent it, by keeping ethnic groups separate from the others. It would be stupid for us to think that different ethnic groups could live together in peace... *in those areas*."

c9hri6p,berylthranox,"In World War I Amir Faysal is promised an independent Arab state in exchange for his aid in starting an Arab Revolt in the southeast of the Ottoman Empire. Faysal eventually captured Damascus but was forced out by the French after the war was over because the secret treaties by the ENTENTE POWERS had already promised that region to France. Iraq was, under Ottoman reign, ruled as three separate regions which were ethnically or religiously distinct. These regions included mixes of Sunni and Shii Muslims and minority groups amoung them. After the war it was important that the Entente powers appease Amir Faysal who led a very auspicious and influential family. This was done by granting him the title of King of Iraq in 1921. Faysal was a Sunni that ruled a country which was majority Shii and contained the oil fields of Kirkul and Mosul which were inhabited by Kurds. In 1958 a coup d'etat occurred which overthrew the monarchy and gradually transmitted power to Ba'athist Party member Saddam Hussein who became powerful enough to attain the title of dictator. Hussein then went on to attack Iran in the First Gulf War which was used as a proxy theater for the cold war. Iraq annexed Kuwait in the 1990 Second Gulf War and U.S. forces intervened. Shia and Kurd minorities revolted against Hussein's rule which promoted Sunni Islam and they expected a large degree of external support which was assured to them. The U.S. ignored the subsequent massacres and Hussein continued to reign until the 21st century. Hussein was kind enough to use [chemical weapons on children](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88_%D9%88_%DA%A9%D9%88%D8%AF%DA%A9_%D8%B4%D9%87%DB%8C%D8%AF_%D8%AD%D9%84%D8%A8%DA%86%D9%87%E2%80%8C%D8%A7%DB%8C.jpg) after being indirectly put in power by the Allied forces of the first world war. It also bears mentioning that Iraq attained independence in 1932 which was nearly 20 years earlier than most other nations in the region. This is because the British realized that they had created a cesspool of violence by forcing a number of groups to work as equals when they had survived for centuries by being independent of one another.You only deny the responsibility of western influence in the middle east because you want to showcase the inhumanity you believe is characteristic of those people. That region existed in relative harmony for centuries because the Ottoman Empire was more experienced in governing a region with a panoply of religious and ethnic ideals. You're only trying to hide your ignorance but you've showcased it boldly and plainly."

c9grwt2,ThrobbingCuntMuscle,"Two years after an assassination resulted in a parliamentary election of a leader who nationalized (i.e. stole from Britain and the US) the petroleum industry. This election was ratified by the Shah at the time who had previously had close ties with Nazi Germany. Why does everyone neglect to mention the reason that the US and Britain overthrew that government, and how terrible it was?A good point would be that the puppet put in place after the overthrow was no saint either, but the back story is nowhere near as cut, dry & clean as you would like to tell though, is it?"
c9h55zk,IllusiveObserver,"I understand where you're coming from, and I had the same thoughts before somebody walked me through the details. No matter which way you cut it, this situation was a complete disaster for the United States and Britain.To say the US and Britian deserved to own the oil there is - to put this nicely - laughable. How did the US and Britain obtain rights to the petroleum industry in Iran? It's really no different than how they acquired all the other resources internationally. But this isn't an important part of the argument.The Iranian government (democratically elected) chose to nationalize the petroluem industry. The industry did not allow itself to be inspected by the Iranians for fair play. Iran saw that an industry controlled by outsiders was either causing harm to the country or could be better used for its people, so Iran thought it had the right to oust them. The UK took Iran to the UN International Court, and Iran won. The UK then went to the US and the event played out.Finally, the Shah's father had tied to Nazi Germany because of economic relations, and was ousted by the allies for his son. Whether his son had Nazi leanings, I doubt. The military dictator put in place after the operation had ties to Nazi's like the Shah's father, for which he was jailed during WWII when Reza had to step down. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abadan_Crisishttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany%E2%80%93Iran_relations#The_first_Pahlavi_era_and_Nazi_Germanyhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"

I imagine it's similar the feeling a gun enthusiast would get seeing someone recklessly and disrespectfully handling a weapon. In both cases, there is the potential for incredible danger, although admittedly the gunplay is more immediately threatening. A democracy depends on an informed citizenry. It is therefore the responsibility of every citizen within any nation that prizes its democratic institutions to become and remain informed on any and every issue that may come before them. Admittedly, in the century to come, this requirement will become more onerous. But that's the price we pay for living in a democratic republic.

c9gracp,Armadillo19,"I think everyone gets that. But America is still in a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario. When America exerts influence in a region to overthrow a regime it does not agree with, it gets huge criticism (and usually rightfully so). Conversely, when the US sits idly by, like it did in Rwanda and Sudan, like it did in Libya, and like it is doing in Syria, you have those calling for US intervention. I have many friends in Venezuela (of all social classes, not just the elite), who told me that they were praying for US intervention to remove Chavez, going back 10 years. I'm not saying I agree with forcible regime change. I think that on the whole, the policy of installing a US-friendly regime is largely responsible for the extent of animosity towards the United States today, especially when false pretenses have been used.At the same time, not every leader is an angel just because they're antithetical to America. I believe in self-determined sovereignty, but there are a lot of times when the international community turns a blind eye to horrible atrocities. Unfortunately, the US (and no other country, for that matter), has taken a humanitarian stance on removing horrible regimes, but instead has only done so in cases of self-interest (which in reality, makes perfect sense - what country acts against their own self interest?).Should it be the international community's/America's responsibility to police the world? Should a completely hands off approach be applicable for every situation, refusing to ever interfere with another nation's sovereignty? You can make a pretty compelling argument for both sides, with no gold standard that is applicable across the board. No matter what, you're always going to have people that are completely opposed to America's actions - be in interference with international affairs, or a complete laissez-affairs approach - damned if you do, damned if you don't."

c9gy1qm,VikingCoder,"Just because we're criticized doesn't mean we didn't take a good path.To a certain degree, we have to trust the people in the room to make the right decisions on our behalf.But if we don't believe they did, we have to speak out."

c9gtcai,Armadillo19,"How about the massive, massive, massive amount of humanitarian/economic aid that the United States Government gives to the rest of the world. Countries like Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, Sudan, Zambia, Somalia, South Sudan and others receive billions and billions of dollars in aid, and in some cases this aid has drastically improved life for these people."
c9gtruf,factsdontbotherme,"You mean the aid in the form of US products sold by private US corporations to the US government then donated to these countries? Large portions of it are simply unsellable overstock that these countries do not need. Yes, yes, there are small scale operations conducted by the US that do good work. There are even 1 or 2 larger scale projects that do some good. But the Trillions the US spends goes into the hands of the rich and ONLY the rich. Never think that different."
c9gsm8k,Madplato,"I can't help but feel like America created this whole ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation by a) intervening in the first place, creating a hard to reverse precedent, and b) building the largest military since forever. Now, they only have two choices: Going in and being criticizes for interfering or not going in and being accused of only going in when there is profit.Now, I don't really get why they keep doing it since everybody hates them for it. But I guess that absolute power over everyone under the sun is a great compensation."
c9gsux9,Armadillo19,"They keep going in because what's done is done, and like you said, the precedent has been set. While American intervention may have helped breed Islamic fanaticism at a higher rate/larger prevalency than would have occurred (debatable, but the argument can most certainly be made), at this point there is no turning back, unfortunately. It's not like the current administration can say ""sorry about that whole lying about WMDs to invade Iraq, let's all be friends"", and then poof, everyone is good. An irreversible world has been set in motion. It may have occurred without American foreign intervention, or America may have helped catalyze it, but what's done is done and there is no going back.At this point, America can only mitigate by amending future policies, and I think that the Obama administration has worked hard to try to do this - yes, I realize there are drone strikes all over Pakistan, Afghanistan etc, however the US showed restraint from intervening in Libya, Mali, Egypt, and now Syria (some would argue to a fault). But with past engagements, you can't just take it back or go back in time to change your foreign policy. Would the Middle East be much more stable if the United States didn't go into Iraq? Would the entire landscape be much different if the US didn't prop up the Shah, leading to the Iranian Revolution? How about intervening in Central America, or backing governments like Pinochet? Unfortunately, the answer is that we'll never know, and in places where we have current engagement, like Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, the made has been made. America can't just ""stop"", because the other side won't just stop. Complex ideologies have grown out of a hundred years or more of foreign policy, which cannot be easily undone."
c9gtmif,Madplato,"Of course it's hard to stop, but it's just gonna be harder twenty years from now if you continue on that path. Maybe avoiding further engagement, or cutting military budget (like a lot, seriously people why do you need so much exploding stuff), would be a good idea by now. Let the UN actually do something for a change. There is no other side. You guys won the cold war, it's done! Now you're just grasping for more power, and the world resent you for it. Why ? Because there is no other side, there is no bad guy. What was it again ? ""You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the monster"""
c9gtuwg,Armadillo19,"First, I think the US has begun to amend their foreign policy, like I said, based on the refusal to get involved in Syria, Egypt, Libya etc, putting the onus on these countries, or a multilateral, international coalition.The UN never has had a damn bit of influence unfortunately, which is one of its biggest criticisms, and this predates Bush's decision to completely ignore the Security Council. I wish the UN did in fact have some pull, but it just isn't built that way. Peace keeping missions have failed on many occasions because the force isn't, and never was, built for that. Lastly, there is another side. The US has plenty of faults, but just because someone isn't the US doesn't mean they're absolved of all evil. The Taliban, Al Qaeda, AQAP, Hezbollah etc are ""the bad guys"" to mirror your terminology, and it's difficult to argue otherwise based on their egregious human rights violations (and I'm not talking about against America, I'm talking about their own people). Hypothetically, if the United States unilaterally disengaged from the Middle East and halted all military and covert operations, do you believe that all of these organizations would just cease to exist? Because I don't buy that - it's not a zero-sum game."
c9h2i02,Madplato,"Of course I don't believe terrorist groups and dictatorship will just disappear. I'm just pointing out the reason why America is so unpopular: you gave yourself the power and legitimacy to try and stop them. Even worst: you are failing at the job you gave yourself. You made yourself the police force of Earth, but you fail to understand how this self appointed position works. You can either police everything, or nothing, but if you stand somewhere in the middle (which is what you are doing) you're just a tyrant who chooses to bully other nations.A lot can be said about U.S. involvement, but a lot (maybe even more) can also be said about U.S non-involvement. After all, ""egregious human rights violations"" as you put it, are rampant on the planet. Yet we only see you try and save the day in specific places. Christ you're even allied with some of the worst human-right violators on the fucking planet. Why is the UN so weak ? Because the U.S. policies destroy the need for a strong UN. Why do developed country always interfere with third world nations ? Because its too easy to do so: we just need to send you guys a fax and bombs start to fall."
c9gseey,wvenable,"> But America is still in a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario.Bullshit. America is hypocritical and people call them out on it. America will gladly use military intervention when it isn't needed but it suits their interests and then by sit idly by when it doesn't. That's not the same as damned if you do, damned if you don't.Frankly if America didn't have a reputation for overthrowing regimes left and right there wouldn't be an expectation for them to go into Rwanda, Sudan, Libya, or Venezuela."
c9gsycr,Osiriskiller,"Yeah America is in a tough situation but the difference is if America hadn't gone in to Iraq and Hussein had killed the Kurds people would have legitimately felt bad, whereas if it's a military mission people are unable to empathize."
c9gt7k7,Armadillo19,"So just for argument's sake, let's dissect this example. First, I'll put the disclaimer that I am not in favor of American engagement in Iraq, ESPECIALLY because false pretenses were used to justify it.That said, you're basically saying that if the variable here was an Iraqi attack on the Kurds, had the US known of it and allowed it to happen, THEN we could have gone in and intervened since people would have felt bad, correct?If this is the case, I have to disagree. If you are truly operating out of a desire to prevent a genocide (again, this is hypothetical since that wasn't at all what the Iraqi invasion was about), I really can't justify just letting it happen so that people ""legitimately feel bad"" and are able to support stopping it. Preemptive military intervention is not ALWAYS a bad thing. The problem is that you can't quantitatively say ""US going into Iraq prevented a Kurdish genocide"". You only know what horrors lie ahead after the fact. Who knows, had Europe not appeased Hitler time and time again leading up to the invasion of Poland in 1939, the world might have been a much different place, with a lot less human lives lost. Would that have been a bad preemptive strike?"
c9gzgrw,let_them_eat_slogans,"> I think everyone gets that. But America is still in a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario. When America exerts influence in a region to overthrow a regime it does not agree with, it gets huge criticism (and usually rightfully so). Conversely, when the US sits idly by, like it did in Rwanda and Sudan, like it did in Libya, and like it is doing in Syria, you have those calling for US intervention.Why is this a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" scenario? Perhaps America is simply criticized for consistently making the wrong choices when it comes to individual opportunities for military intervention."
c9h04up,Armadillo19,Ha ok. I'm glad you have the foreign policy expertise to determine that America is constantly wrong. Maybe we should have gone into Syria then?
c9h22hw,let_them_eat_slogans,"Maybe. I'm just saying it's pretty self-serving to say America is in a ""damned if you do, damned if you don't"" situation. It could just as easily be the case that America consistently making bad foreign policy situations."
c9gsevx,lowrads,"Let's be realistic, all major actors on the world stage end up having deep ties to *all* factions vying for power anywhere in the world, even the homicidal scary ones. In most parts of the world, all sides are just competing patronage networks, sometimes with a dash of ideology some of us like and some of us hate. Whatever group comes to power, you can always say that another powerful state supported them, because the support extended to the eliminated interest network no longer matters."
c9gsjt3,VikingCoder,"Well said.My point, though, was that astrobuckeye shouldn't be surprised there's anti-American sentiments. Even if we were *saints* there'd be anti-American sentiments.And sometimes the case against America's actions is so solid and terrible that anyone who denies we acted poorly are just... *dangerous.*"
c9gqain,astrobuckeye,You mean like the Shah. Yeah we fucked that up. The whole world got mightily fucked by imperialism and colonialism too. Are we supposed to let innocents get slaughtered while it sorts itself out? It's a genuine question. There aren't time machines. We can't go back and undo what was done. What's the solution? Let dictators and despots murder their civilians and hope it all works out. Because that approach has worked so well in North Korea. I personally all for America bowing out of policing the international political landscape. But innocent people are still going to killed.
c9gqhjt,VikingCoder,"> Are we supposed to let innocents get slaughtered while it sorts itself out?Nope. But we also don't have a right to act surprised people say ""Fuck America,"" as your post implied.> We can't go back and undo what was done.Nope. But we're supposed to learn. Overthrowing the government of Iraq, without the troops to maintain sufficient order, was an avoidable mistake.> What's the solution? Let dictators and despots murder their civilians and hope it all works out.Nope. We probably shouldn't *arm* those dictators and despots, as we did in Iraq and Iran.> I personally all for America bowing out of policing the international political landscape.I'm not. I think we need a stronger UN, sure."
c9gqrgc,Heathen92,I'm with you on most of these points but the UN doesn't have a very good track record of effective direct action. Something new would be nice.
c9grite,homerjaythompson,"I agree about the UN. But if you want an effective UN, you have to acknowledge that their proper place during the build up to the invasion of Iraq would have been an international force to deter the invasion. I'm serious. Let that sink in for a moment. If the UN was doing its job as a force to stop aggression, it would have sent soldiers from around the world to oppose and deter the United States and Britain in their bilateral decision to invade a sovereign nation in a preemptive war of aggression, the undertaking of the supreme war crime. Just some food for thought when we get thinking about when and where the UN ought to take action."
c9gqfv5,BroastedRedPepper,"The US has and continues to slaughter innocents, who have they saved by going to war with Iraq and Afghanistan? They've just brought more bloodshed to the region. And lets not forget that Afghanistan and the rise of Jihadism is a product of Cold War era anti-Soviet politics. Carter and Reagan gave money and arms to extremists, and this has been absolutely devastating (clearly).Quick Edit: Not to mention they only intervene when it's strategically to our advantage, rather than for humanitarian reasons as you seem to suggest."
c9gqjea,,Bosnia and Kosovo was definitely in our strategic interests./s

c9gqs9t,,"So what did the US get out of that, Professor?"
c9gquqi,BroastedRedPepper,"Having a presence and military influence over a recently broken up Eastern Bloc is a clear interest the US would have.

c9gro6r,BroastedRedPepper,"Human rights violations/small prison camp tho... It's still a position the region that was gained, this is the definition of a strategic PRESENCE. Having a military presence in a former Soviet region gives them a control they didn't have before, not to mention there were surely other reasons at the time when it was closer to the end of the Cold War. Humanitarian interests no doubt had their place, but when you examine US foreign policy in a broader context (this conflict is really VERY small compared to others we've engaged in), you'll really start to see that we push our own regional military interests at the expense of the country we get involved in. The fact that Bosnia and Kosovo didn't end in complete military disaster does not change this."
c9gqy9h,,"no fucking shit. That's what every nation does. Please show me the altruistic nation that doesn't bother anyone and is not self interested... Oh right Tibet, and they got steamrolled and set on fire by China. We drop aid all over the goddamn world, whenever somebody presses the panic button guess who gets the call?"
c9gr67t,BroastedRedPepper,"The point isn't to be altruistic, the point is to improve the world and if you're intervening to improve the country for its citizens. The US has a long history of interventionist foreign policy that goes against the direct interest of the people in that country. Vietnam, Nicaragua, Iraq, Afghanistan, Phillipines, etc.. I think you get the picture. We drop aid but we also drop bombs (a lot of bombs), install dictators, and assasinate people we don't like. The problem is that US foreign policy is mostly about making the world more convenient for us, and usually not the citizens of the countries we intervene in (and often destroy). It's important to objective about how well the government is succeeding in making the world a better place and long-term effects of our world policy. Blindly accepting injustices on the basis of some positive action is foolish, criticism brings change and improves government."
c9grj2i,,Of course it is. Every nation that actually matters has the same foreign policy. Iran wants nukes so we don't kick their asses. China is raping the earth so they can industrialize up to our level. Russia doesn't want our missile defense systems in Europe so that they still pose a threat.
c9grqah,BroastedRedPepper,"US wants to push their government/military influence over various countries to take command of world resources. And even if every nation ""that matters"" (don't they all matter?) has the same foreign policy, this hardly justifies it being right. Do you not see the problem with the invasions I've listed above? I am genuinely curious about this fyi, not just being rhetorical."
c9gryr0,,"No they don't all matter. I'm not talking about human lives I'm talking about as players on the world stage. Every nation tries to maximize their power, it's how the system works because it's how humans work. You try to get a job that makes you the most money. It's why capitalism works, and why socialism doesn't."
c9gs71i,BroastedRedPepper,"I disagree, it doesn't have to be this way. You've also done nothing to refute socialism in your answer. That said, I don't have the energy to debate that and even if you aren't socialist there still seems to be no reason to morally support what the US is doing. Saying ""it's how humans work"" is retarded, everything has a historical and social context."
c9gsfd3,,"You honestly expect me to sit here and tell you why a socialist economy doesn't work? No. I'm not gonna spell that out for you. Go look it up if you want it ""refuted."" Go pick up a history book and find a large, prosperous civilization that didn't exercise control through power and war. It's how the world works, whether you want it to or not."
c9gsyzn,Madplato,"The problem is: Capitalism, by its very definition, doesn't *work*. It cannot and should not work. It consumes all thing, including human lives, in order to burn just a little bit brighter, a little bit longer. How people fail to understand that the ""maximizing profit"" doctrine can't, and will not, work forever is beyond my ability to comprehend. It's like burning your winter coat while standing in the tundra. Sure, you'll be kinda warm for 15 minutes, but then you'll just die like an idiot. I find it highly amusing to see a nation spend inimaginable amount of money on bombs and tanks, while being torn appart by debates over free health care. Wake up. People that manage to gain anything from war and power, you're not one of them. And guess what ? They don't care about you. Not one second. >Go pick up a history book and find a large, prosperous civilization that didn't exercise control through power and warYour rhetoric is flawed to the core. You, go pick up an history book and show me a civilisation, a hundred year ago, that let women vote. Go back 500 years and show me a democracy including all people living in a giving territory. Things change and that's how the world works whether you want it to or not."
c9gt5tp,,"I'm currently living in the worlds only hyperpower, we were built on war... So yeah, it's actually done a lot for me. I guess capitalism is flawed then eh? Socialism is clearly the better option, just look at North Korea, or Cuba! They're rolling in success!"
c9gthxd,Madplato,"Please, try and understand what socialism *is*, then maybe you won't make a fool of yourself by comparing violent dictatorship with actual socialism. Just a heads up: It's not socialism because they *say* it is. Sure, you might be doing relatively better than others, congrats, but it's only a temporary byproduct. How long will it last ? Nobody knows but who cares. They need you relatively healthy and able to work (a lot) and buy things (even more). For now at least. Like they needed that guy that lost both legs in the bombing...sure they needed him then but let's see what happens to him now. Or that other guys, father of two, that died in a fucking explosion in a desert hundreds of miles from home and family so you could live in the only hyper power. Yeah they needed him too, until they just didn't need him anymore. Funny how it works eh ?But you should not worry. Keep burning you're fucking coat. It's so much warmer like that..."
c9gu3y8,,"Socialism is equal wealth and no incentive for innovation or higher education outside of recreation. State owned and operated. I'm certainly in favor of a hybrid between capitalism and socialism, but full on 100% socialism doesn't work."
c9h25od,Madplato,"This is a gross over-simplification. Socialism is, mainly, about social justice and equity. Of course, better distribution of wealth is one thing, but pretty short sighted considering the scope of the theory. It's more about creating equal opportunities and life quality for every citizen, and encouraging people to better themselves and strengthening the community trough work and projects. The incentive for higher education, work and innovation is not money. Money has no worth in itself, it's just a piece of paper or a bunch of 1s and 0s in computer. Money is just a mean to an end (currently the only mean to that end): to make your life better and maybe, just maybe, to make the world better. Now, how in the world did some people deserve better lives than other ? Especially when we have the means to guarantee a good life for everybody. Did they work for it or were just born in the right place ? The vast majority of people have nothing to lose and everything to gain in such a change."

I've read countless books/essays/opinions on economics, history, and politics. Capitalism, anarcho-capitalism, libertarianism, Marxist theory, etc. Rushing to judgement before hearing all sides is a silly thing to do. I can honestly say that socialism is not only the most morally sound theory, but democratic control of ownership is the most economically and socially fair governmental idea. I've heard many perspectives and continue to re-evaluate my positions everyday. A democratic socialist economy hasn't been enacted yet (ironically US has tried to prevent this), and don't even get me started on USSR (their ""socialism"" has been a huge stain to the equality and TRUE democracy of Marx's ideas). As for:> It's how the world works, whether you want it to or not.How the world *currently* works, isn't necessarily how it **SHOULD** work. I suggest you read Albert Einstein's article ""Why Socialism?"" and even though you're probably thinking that I'm wrong, it only takes a couple minutes.

Bahrain continues to get a free pass for political/military reasons, while we supported a dictator in Egypt because he generally allied with us.If we invade a country for our own motives, rather than for purely humanitarian reasons, then we ought to do our best to ensure no innocent civilians are killed.

c9i7rsr,whiteychs,That wasn't the argument. Of course we given more readily to countries which can reciprocate.The point was that we *DO* give to countries that can not give much in return (if anything).
c9i8mjk,ForgingFakes,But in comparison to some other countries... It might as well be nothing.
c9i8vj8,whiteychs,The US is actually the #1 provider of humanitarian aid in the world.We give over *double* that of the #2 (France).[wiki source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governments_by_development_aid#Official_Development_Assistance_by_country_in_absolute_terms_in_2009_.28April_2010.29)That's also not counting other forms of aid such as the USNS Mercy/Comfort which provide emergency medical care (such as after the disasterous Haiti earthquake).

Often it's only when there is an ulterior motive or a secondary gain to be made, i.e. oil in the case of Iraq. It's not shocking or anything out of the ordinary in international politics, but it's not deniable either. My point was that actual humanitarian aid given by most western countries (my fair country of Australia is very much included in this) don't actually make sizeable contributions that do *anything* to help. I'm not talking about interventions here my friend, that's another topic entirely, I'm talking about financial and diplomatic aid."

What if we do this, what is likely to happen? Throwing money at a poor country is great on an individual level.

c9gs6yt,joskebangelijk,"yes, perhaps but the reason being direct profit from the supposed Aid being resources is not Humanitarian aid.Of course you're going to put the flag on the box, it's to create good will, but also there are organizations out there doctors without borders or amnesty international who get grants from the EU or individual sponsors to go out and help people. There is no real poster op for that Aid...Also there is a food program within the EU which drops aid with the EU label on it: http://europa.eu/abc/symbols/emblem/images/europ_flag/jaune.jpgwhich I gather even the EU knows, apart from a select few and member states few people know."

However, when we're willing to spend trillions on the military side, but balk over a $15 billion infrastructure rebuilding package, I'd say we're pretty half assing it. When we fly drones over and accidentally kill hundreds if not thousands of innocents per year, because we don't want to go in and make sure we're hitting the right target, that's half assing it.War and killing should be taken seriously.

When one side doesn't identify themselves as your enemy until they make an attack, and operate in populated areas, there is no way to avoid civilian casualties. You try your best to identify the person, and fire a missile at them when you're fairly certain there will be minimal collateral damage.Yes you could decide to not fire a missile at them, because things could go bad. Then that guy gets away and next week blows up a crowded market. So there's going to be civilian casualties no matter which decision you make. You fire the missile there may be civilian casualties. You don't fire there may be civilian casualties. That's the scary thing about it. It's all down to probabilities. I assure you, it is taken seriously. The military happens to take seriously the deaths that terrorists inflict, while you apparently don't.

c9gta7l,Cenodoxus,">No one deserves to die for the sake of an ideological cause. That's the point. And I'm not inclined to disagree. But this wasn't a case of ""Allende was good and everyone in Chile was happy and bunnies frolicked in the streets and then HOLY SHIT THE CIA CAME TO TOWN and then everything sucked."" Allende was a polarizing president who did a lot of good things, but came extraordinarily close to destroying the Chilean economy, the value of the Chilean escudo (now the peso), and the country's agriculture. He also refused to execute any laws passed by the national legislature that he didn't like, or obey decisions from the Chilean supreme court that he thought were inconvenient. From the outside looking in, Allende was within shouting distance of being exactly the kind of dictator that America gets accused of instantly supporting. With respect to ""democratically elected,"" 2/3 of the country never voted for him, and Chile's legislative and judicial branches were increasingly unable to stop or influence whatever he wanted to do.Someone with a more holistic view of the situation in Chile might be inclined to question the extent to which the U.S. made any serious difference. It didn't send guns to Chile, it didn't send any other weapons, it didn't put boots on the ground, and roughly 2/3 of the Chilean government and most of its military (including its intelligence services) was afraid of Allende's increasingly brazen efforts to consolidate power, and pleaded with the Nixon administration for aid. The U.S. made the greatest impact in donating money to Chile's opposition parties in addition to (here's the really problematic part of the ""U.S. is teh evil!!!1!!"" argument) forgiving $200 million of old loans at the Allende government's request and providing both food aid and business grants. If we want to reduce this to a matter of numbers, the amount of monetary aid that the Allende government got from the U.S. was approximately 25 times greater than the amount the U.S. donated to Chile's Liberal and Christian Democratic Parties. It's incredibly myopic -- and for that matter, an amazing insult to the Chileans involved -- to characterize the coup against Allende as ""CIA-backed"" when the CIA was, at best, an incredibly tiny part of what was going on."

As a result of the 1978 Camp David Accords, Egypt became the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid in the world regardless of whomever was in power at the time. Over the decades, aid has shifted more and more to the form of military equipment and training for a particular reason. The U.S. has long since learned that monetary aid to most Arab countries has a habit of disappearing into bureaucrats' pockets with no effect on the local population, and food aid can and will be sold privately for the same reason. However, it's pretty difficult to steal something the size of a tank.The U.S. also supported Egyptian NGOs pushing for democracy and women's rights, and small business grants targeted at the poor, with a special emphasis on female and minority-owned businesses. This was distributed more privately and without fanfare in order to reduce the amount of corruption the program attracted, and most of the recipients were in fact unaware that the U.S. was the source of their grants.The end result was that the Egyptian population as a whole got to be pissed at the U.S. for ""supporting"" Mubarak, and the Mubarak government got to be pissed at the U.S. for being a political nuisance with its aid to democracy NGOs. Many people in the U.S. State Department are depressed over the nature of their work. This is why."

c9gv4ck,Yakooza1,"This doesn't explain shit.Allende won through a democratic process. Whether he was supported by the military or whether most of the people voted or not is irrelevant. Whether Allende was the best president ever is irrelevant. He won through elections and was supported by much of its population. The major opposition that he speaks of against Allende was the military junta and the likes of Pinochet, who took power in the coup and immediately started terror on his supporters.The US was afraid of him winning re-election so they funded his opposition and staged a coup, so as to replace him with a brutal dictator that was far less popular and less democratic than Allende. How is that all excused because Allende had faults? They turned their democratic process into a dictatorship, which produced far worse results in every sector that Allende was criticized for. >The possibility of Allende winning Chile's 1970 election was deemed a disaster by a US administration which wanted to protect US business interests by preventing any spread of Communism during the Cold War.[52] In September 1970, President Nixon informed the CIA that an Allende government in Chile would not be acceptable and authorized $10 million to stop Allende from coming to power or unseat him.[53] Henry Kissinger's 40 Committee and the CIA planned to impede Allende's investiture as President of Chile with covert efforts known as ""Track I"" and ""Track II""; Track I sought to prevent Allende from assuming power via so-called ""parliamentary trickery"", while under the Track II initiative, the CIA tried to convince key Chilean military officers to carry out a coup.[53]During Nixon's presidency, U.S. officials attempted to prevent Allende's election by financing political parties aligned with opposition candidate Jorge Alessandri and supporting strikes in the mining and transportation sectors.[54]Also>After General Pinochet assumed power, United States Secretary of **State Henry Kissinger told President Richard Nixon that the U.S. ""didn't do it,"" but ""we helped them...created the conditions as great as possible."" **(referring to the coup itself).[60] Recent documents declassified under the Clinton administration's Chile Declassification Project show that the United States government and the CIA sought the overthrow of Allende in 1970 immediately before he took office (""Project FUBELT"")And>The most prominent U.S. corporations in Chile prior to Allende's presidency were the Anaconda and Kennecott copper companies, and ITT Corporation, International Telephone and Telegraph. Both the copper corporations aimed to expand privatized copper production in the city of El Teniente in the Chilean Andes, the world's largest underground copper mine.[58] At the end of 1968, according to US Department of Commerce data, U.S. corporate holdings in Chile amounted to $964 million. Anaconda and Kennecott accounted for 28% of U.S. holdings, but ITT had by far the largest holding of any single corporation, with an investment of $200 million in Chile.[58] In 1970, before Allende was elected, ITT owned 70% of Chitelco, the Chilean Telephone Company and funded El Mercurio, a Chilean right-wing newspaper. Documents released in 2000 by the CIA confirmed that before the elections of 1970, ITT gave $700,000 to Allende's conservative opponent, Jorge Alessandri, with help from the CIA on how to channel the money safely. ITT president Harold Geneen also offered $1 million to the CIA to help defeat Allende in the elections.[59]It should be precisely clear that the US served only to better its business interests without any regard for the well being of Chile. In doing so they destroyed a viable democracy and replaced it with a dictator.Just because the conditions in Chile weren't the best possible does not at all excuse the US of imperialism."
c9h0j5h,Cenodoxus,">The major opposition that he speaks of against Allende was the military junta and the likes of PinochetThe major opposition involved was 2/3 of the Chilean legislature, the supreme court, its national organizations for various businesses and trades, the military, the national banks, and roughly 2/3 of the population that never voted for him anyway. Allende didn't give a shit about the Chilean constitution's limits on presidential power. Imagine for a moment what would happen if a U.S. president stopped signing any Congressional bill he didn't like no matter how many votes it got, decided not to recognize or enforce any Supreme Court decision with which he didn't agree, and instructed his administration to override or ignore any law on the country's books that as inconvenient to their political agenda. The only possible result would be an economic implosion and total chaos. That's what happened to Chile when Allende started disregarding his constitutional mandate, and all of it in a nation where he'd never had a majority of the popular vote anyway. His heart may have been in the right place, but there's a term for leaders who go power-mad and start doing whatever they want under the rationale that their agenda's more important then the law.To describe Chile as a ""viable democracy"" in this period simply bypasses the destruction to the democratic process that Allende himself had caused. To argue that the U.S. ""staged the coup"" is equally incorrect, and at no point in the paragraphs you've copied wholesale from Wikipedia is there anything to support this assertion. The U.S. got involved for multiple reasons, but only one of them was American-owned businesses in Chile. I think it would also be a real stretch to assert that the fairly small sums involved with the CIA's support of opposition parties made a greater difference to Chile's fate than the popular anger and fear created by Allende's disregard for the constitution."

America is one actor of many, albeit a large one. - Matters are always far more complicated than screaming ideologues on either side are prepared to acknowledge.I would also argue that many of the world's current problems derive from the reckless creation of meaningless national borders by former empires (see Africa, the Middle East, and a wide swathe of Asia). The U.S. had nothing to do with the partition of Europe's colonial territories, but is nonetheless on the hook for dealing with the socioeconomic failure that was generally the result.And the reason I find Reddit's sometimes vicious anti-Americanism irritating is that once someone's finished explaining what a giant sack of bastards the Americans were in, say, Chile, they are almost never able to explain in detail exactly what the Chileans themselves thought or were doing at the time. (You'll notice that the only person in this thread who's trying to counter me with actual history has resorted to grabbing three paragraphs directly off Wikipedia.) That's because they think the Chileans are only important to history insofar as they were ""victims"" of the Americans.

I think you might be mixing up your events.>Oh and explain the Contra.The Sandinistas didn't exactly come to power on a wave of sunshine and daisies, and many of their founding members had been funded and trained by the KGB. The CIA believed the Sandinista's overthrow of the Somoza government was a cover for the creation of another Soviet satellite state, and one that was all the more dangerous with advancing Soviet ICBM technology. The Cuban missile crisis was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war, and the CIA had no intention of allowing the set of circumstances that precipitated it to happen again. Hence the U.S. support of the contras, who had plenty of their own gripes given the violent consolidation of the Sandinistas' power and their repression of free speech and free association in Nicaragua. As with Chile, the U.S. didn't create the opposition to the government -- it supported the opposition that already existed.What a lot of people forget (or otherwise don't know) is that Congress had initially approved $100 million in aid for the Sandinista government in 1979. This was before reports started flooding in about the Sandinistas' crackdown on dissent and their own set of death squads ""disappearing"" former Somoza government members and anyone from within their own ranks who questioned the junta's political decisions. It's one of the reasons that a sizable percentage of the Contras was actually former Sandinistas."

c9gr0kj,,"I agree that American politics are a shit show, and that the US is guilty of some very definitely bad things over the course of its history. But as an honest question, do you think Canada benefits quite a bit from being the ""good cop"" of the Northern Americas"
c9gygtj,JonoLith,"I'd say that there are two general ways of thinking about dealing with the U.S. These can be roughly broken into ""Conservative"" and ""Liberal"". We actually have a functioning democracy, so there's more then just the two parties, but it can be boiled down to those two camps. The Conservatives think we should be exactly like the United States. Privatize everything, fuck the poor, war is great, etc. The Liberals generally think that we should look after the poor, that interventionism is sometimes necessary, and that there are services that should remain in the public domain. Needless to say, when the Conservatives are in power, we lose a ton of international support. Currently, we have a Conservative government. Whenever there's an international event, people don't even talk to us. We're seen as an extension of the United States. When the Liberals are in power, there's a sense that we're at least *trying* to deal with the behemoth that is America while maintaining some kind of ethical position in the world. I definitely think that Canada has benefited from being a kind, supportive, strong country, and that is most likely augmented by the fact that our neighbor is crazy. I'd like to think we would be a respected nation even if the States was operating sanely."

c9gwmlu,desperatehokie,"I'm not sure why you are saying ""wow"" to the first point. Maybe because it is insensitive to give praise to a dictator like Pinochet? My boyfriend goes to Chile for work, and being of Peruvian heritage myself I have many family members in South America. I don't know why you would disagree with the idea that Chile is one of the more advanced countries in Latin America currently. From my impressions, this is true now, regardless of what Pinochet was doing a couple decades ago. Though I hate to admit it, there is a marked difference in prosperity from my family's home country of Peru and Chile. Chile was the first South American country to join the OECD. If I'm not mistaken, Chile also has the highest GDP per capita in the region, save for *maybe* Argentina. I was always under the impression that Pinochet, the horrible tyrant that he was, did truthfully do a lot for Chilean infrastructure. The public transit in Santiago is fucking nice, I know the plans were in place before the coup...but I thought Pinochet played a large role in its development? Not to mention the many free market reforms of the decade.I think a better argument against Scotch rather than just saying ""wow"" would be to say that economic development of a country should not be used as an excuse to pardon or somehow justify the crimes of a tyrant.I also don't know what you mean about American Propaganda industry with respect to this particular subject. My entire life I don't think I've heard a peep about Pinochet in American media. I was what...three or four when Pinochet left office...so maybe I missed the boat? I just don't think the ""American Propaganda machine"" cares about Pinochet anymore. Edit: Fixed grammar issues."
c9gy43r,JonoLith,"> I don't think I've heard a peep about Pinochet in American media. I'm gonna start by straight up apologizing for being dickish earlier. Tired and grumpy me is not pleasant to deal with. Silence about their genocides is the primary way the American media deals with them. The idea is that if they don't report on them, or teach them, then their own populace is ignorant of the atrocities that are carried out in their names. Pinochet worked for American interests exclusively. Any benefits he might have had were secondary to corporate profits. He was basically the thug they put in control while their ""economists"" went to work harvesting the nation. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Boys It is true that Chile is bouncing back from this after having democratic elections once again. I'm not entirely sure what the state of their economy is right at the moment, but I'm sure having their country privatized and harvested for fifty years didn't help people out."

c9gsmg2,astrobuckeye,Yes I've read history books. Yes I know America has down stupid shit. But its frustrating that it feels as if America gets blamed for all the world's ills. The European imperialism and World Wars have nothing to do with modern instability. But lets bash America for being uninvolved and let's bash them for interfering.
c9gszvq,rctsolid,"Yeah I agree America does get a disproportionate amount of blame. That's true. However, you need to remember that the World Wars are fast losing their relevance, especially for younger generations it's mostly what's happened in the last 25 years. Despite my criticisms of the US, I do believe it has the capability to be a country that can essentially be top dog for centuries, but internal conflicts need to be cleaned up first.

c9gx371,astrobuckeye,Yes because Post-WWII activities like creating the state of Israel and the British dividing up the Ottoman empire like party favors has no impact on the modern day tensions in the Middle East.

When there isn't hegemony, nations fight each other to try to get hegemony.We don't like an empire existing, because it sucks. But the alternative sucks more. So there are complaints about it sucking when the US does stuff (expanding the empire). And people get scared when the US doesn't do stuff (is the empire weakening?). It takes a soft touch.

Honestly, I haven't been mad about any of this for quite some time. I'm tired. I'm sad... I came to the realization last year that I've not lived a single year on this planet during a time of peace. Every breathing moment of my existence, there have been at least 2 countries in open, armed conflict. Almost every single movie I grew up loving, the core conflict has degenerated into base violence. Every cartoon, every children's movie especially, has had it's triumphant climax as a brawl of some sort trying to make it something laughable or entertaining. Every video game from Double Dragon and Super Mario right up until Catherine, it was at it's core a game about beating up the bad guy. There has always been a bad guy. There has always apparently been someone envisioning a need for a target. I have never been in a world that even so much as took a break from violence, on any political level. I've never been in a world where someone didn't have a vested interest in making sure someone else was afraid of a generalization, so that they could keep doing what they needed, but usually just wanted, to do. And it all makes me immensely sad. When I hear about people killing others, I can't bring myself to be angry. I hear someone demanding a death penalty, and it weighs down on me. The entire world seems to want to burn every patch of dirt it isn't standing on itself. I don't even question that part of it anymore. the only question that I've got left: what lets the world forget that what just happened was tragic, when it's not happening to them.

If anything, that politician is the guilty person, I have nothing against this soldier.Seriously, go read the history of Afghanistan, how it was doing all fine until Russia occupied that and US decided to confront Russia by promoting Taliban and consequently Al Qaeda. And how after Russia left, US left Afghanistan in shambles that ended up in 9/11. Also read the history of CIA blowbacks, for example in Iran, and how they sponsored a coup that overturned a democratic government and prepared the situation for the ultra-religious regime of Islamic Republic. Please spend some time and read the relation of US and Israel and all the military and financial aid that Israel is getting from US and how US has helped Israel to dodge all the UN resolutions against Israeli occupation and has helped it to continue its apartheid and oppressing Palestinians. Do you think when drones target people in Pakistan or Afghanistan it is always bad guys who are killed? no innocents bystanders? no children? Or how about US invasion of Iraq on the false premise of WMD, and all the consequences?!I am not excusing the terrorism, but terrorism is a phenomena and like any other phenomena has an explanation.

c9grquy,,"I've seen 200,000. The infant and child mortality rate doubled from 1992 to 2000; my understanding is that this led to 200,000 additional under 5 deaths. This is a massive loss of life, but it seems like an unjust allocation of anger to blame one of the many countries responsible for levying sanctions (yes, the U.S. spearheaded the effort but the entire U.N. security council voted for the sanctions as well) instead of the Iraqi dictatorship that was directly killing its civilians at the same time as well.**EDIT:** I shouldn't have implied that the U.S doesn't share the blame. The previous paragraph of this post is illogical and leads to an invalid either/or statement. In reality both parties are at fault, because either could have done something to stop the starvation of the Iraqi people. I'm sorry for wasting your time with an argument like that."
c9grx7t,answersandstuff,"I'm not sure what your argument is. It seems like you're saying ""Yeah, what we did was wrong, but other people said it was OK so really no one should be angry at us."" There are a lot of arguments against the efficiency of the security council, and it has been used as a ploy for American interests in many circumstances. I don't think that by shifting the decision to the UN we lift any culpability in reality.I do not think America is unique in the West for preying upon third world countries, and the security council itself certainly represents the drive for Western hegemony. However, in cases like this the decisions of the security council fit within a larger foreign policy plan advocated by the US: A desire to isolate Arabic and Muslim countries in the Middle East when they do not follow political trajectories that are pro-American."
c9gt53w,,"I actually agree with everything you've said except for the last line. My point was that blaming the U.S for the entirety of those deaths is foolhardy but I didn't get it across eloquently at all.

You've got to remember that there are people controlling these drones, and people making the decisions behind the strikes. People you'd probably run into in the grocery store and not think twice.

c9gvg02,tsk05,"So Saddam was evil because he went on a war we encouraged him to go on? You say he killed 1,000,000+ but we were the ones that propped that war up because of Iran. So how much responsibility do you want to take for this evil war, given that we funded, armed and encouraged it? Because you just dropped that number there like 'look at that evil Saddam'.With regard to sanctions, we knew Saddam wasn't going to meet all those demands, the point was to pressure him to do so with civilian suffering. That civil suffering ended up being 400,000 deaths. And then we said it's worth it on national television (which got broadcast across the world). It's stark how similar that it to terrorists that know we won't stop occupying their countries but kill us with demands that we stop doing so. Each side kills civilians with the hope of forcing change."

c9gv79v,Chroko,"I believed GWB when he said Iraq was building WMDs, cocooned in the comfort of my couch with access to infinite internet and TV news media.It took [the leak of a government memo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street_memo) years after the war had started for the justifications to begin to show cracks.So it's really not a stretch to imagine that a professional soldier believed what his superiors were telling him, that he believed in the mission - and that he's now justifiably upset that the shit he went through and the waste of life he saw that had no real purpose.If you're not outraged at our ""leaders"" for the Iraq war, you should be."

c9gyb1y,,"Um, he did have chemical weapons and was known to use them. And guess what, chemical weapons are weapons of mass destruction. So when you look at us invading Iraq for use and having them, then we are ENTIRELY justified. Just here pointing to that hole in your entire arguement here."
c9grikg,,Who gave this idiot gold?
c9gqtv6,,"Hahahaha no, you're putting words into this gentleman's mouth. Did he ever say we don't cause collateral damage? Did he ever talk about whether going into Iraq was right or wrong? No, all he's saying is targeting a terrorist camp with a drone strike is not the same fucking thing as blowing apart the legs of civilians trying to run in the goddamn Boston marathon."

c9groge,crakk,"Yemen has a good amount of IEDs and suicide bombers, no? Yemen is not a safe place, they blow themselves up even without drone strikes. The people there know who's a terrorist and who isn't, or at least they have a good idea. They allow these terrorists to live in their cities and don't do anything about it. Sure, they're scared, they may die; these terrorist are dangerous. But it's there obligation as a human being to do something...or someone else will; in this case the US. The people allow these terrorists to hide among them, making the cities targets. A lot of these Middle East countries are safe havens for terrorists. I'm not saying its a great situation, but these people are dangerous and must be dealt with. We can allow them to live and spread Sharia all over the Middle Eastern countries, or we can try to eliminate the threat. The people are oppressed in these countries, most don't like the situation they're in. Do you really think any woman in her right mind, being fully knowledgeable about the western world, would choose to wear a veil all day and be given pretty much no rights? Probably not. These people are not going to be liberated without some bloodshed. Drone strikes or not, people are going to die. The US was not founded by conversation; It was founded by brutal wars where a ton of blood was spilled, by both sides. ----------------------------TL;DR Drone strikes are sometimes a necessary evil."
c9gs8m8,yes_thats_right,"Each nation attacks with the weapons it can use effectively. Striking at civilians might just be the only way that these people can retaliate effectively.I don't think that the western civilians can seriously keep funding wars against other nations and then say ""oh, you aren't allowed to attack us at home, you have to hit our military targets only"". If my tax money is funding an attack on a civilians home, then I have just justified an attack against myself."
c9gsua0,EldritchSquiggle,"So murder is fine so long as there is a ""root cause?"""
c9gswgb,yes_thats_right,"You are the only person who has suggested that murder is fine.My statement is saying that us attacking their people is similar to them attacking our people. Trying to divide it into military v civilians makes no sense in the scheme of things, we cannot simply say that they must attack our soldiers and leave us alone whilst we organize and fund our military from home."
c9gt4s1,EldritchSquiggle,"I just skipped the euphemistic language. You said ""if my tax money is funding an attack... then I have justified an attack against myself"" Attacking civilians deliberately is a war crime, and terrorist attacks on civilians are not justified by an occupation.War is bad, attacking nonCombatants is worse."
c9gtadv,yes_thats_right,"I believe we are having a philosophical discussion here rather than a legal discussion so what one court has labelled vs another court isn't really what I'm talking about.My philosophical viewpoint is that people who pay for, vote for and enable war are just as much a part of the war as the person who has to carry the weapon and pull the trigger. We cannot, as a society, choose to go to war with another society and then tell them which of us they are allowed to retaliate against."
c9gte53,EldritchSquiggle,"I was talking about morality more than anything. Put it this way, soldiers know they sign up to fight and die for the decisions their country makes, fighting them is fine. Targeting civilians who never agreed to fight, might not even want to live in their country let alone support it and might only stay in it as they have no where else to go is not fine. It is utterly immoral, trying to dress it up with the whole ""no one is innocent"" view is to use the excuse of the tyrants and mass murderers."
c9gtkqb,yes_thats_right,"I think we will have to disagree then. I don't think you or anyone else will be able to convince me that I may request, organize and fund attacks on other people but can avoid all accountability because I don't wear a uniform.Your view on war sounds a lot more like a boxing match which has rules and where both sides are fighting under the same rules, with the same constraints and where both sides have decided to enter the ring. Reality is very different to this."
c9gtp8k,EldritchSquiggle,"And i find your view of accountability very black and white, as you say, reality isn't like this. The view you take justifies attacks on children, civilians in totalitarian states, aid workers of the ""right"" nationality.I guess we are going to disagree.Edit, some wars have been more like a boxing match, some haven't, some one side has acted, for want of a better term, honourably, and the other hasn't. The north African campaign in WWII involved no mass murder little killing of civilians. Wars can be executed in a way that doesn't bring death on civilians. I don't think it unreasonable for us to try to hold our governments and all other combatants to the highest possible standards of morality in a situation."
c9gyjg3,yes_thats_right,"WWII is an interesting example to bring up since the US forced Japan to surrender after intentionally bombing a large number of civilians. I didn't think of it before, but that seems like quite a similar action as to what terrorists do, only on a much larger scale."
c9grpps,,[deleted]
c9grzvl,crakk,"So you want us to invade the country and send in soldiers to die? That's the alternative. A full ground invasion (which would cost a ton) in which case innocents will die as well, or drone strikes. I'm not saying its right, but when the enemy hides among civilians, they know what they're doing. If the terrorists were really ""for the people"" they wouldn't use civilians as a deterrents for the US. They know that there will be collateral damage where US weapons will kill innocents, and it'll look good for the terrorist. It's a bullshit thing we (US) have to deal with, but since nobody else is doing anything, we have to intervene. Having these terrorists live and flourish, unhindered in there motives, spells trouble for the world. They're not a US problem, they're a global problem."
c9gr3d9,,You seem more than reasonably disgruntled.
c9gtlko,Osiriskiller,"A ""real veteran""? What the fuck do you know about what constitutes a real veteran? He knows more about what the guy did than you fucking do. BECUASE HE DID THE SAME SHIT. Fuck off with your ad hominem. Make an actual argument."

c9grrmn,ARGHIMBATMAN,guys can't we all just agree that finance is the worst
c9gs4nb,SuperHottSauce,Cant disagree more. A very good friend of mine was finance and had to ruck several clicks into an area in Afghanistan that was too hostile for birds or vehicle to drive into. He did this so he could drop of thousands of dollars in cash to a local business who was building a road in the area to improve local trade. A huge risk in my opinion. Many times he has flown into very hot AO guarding PALLETS of money to reach his destination and he was accountable for every penny of that money. Every MOS has its inherent risks than most soldiers rarely see unless they do the job themselves.
c9gsaf7,ARGHIMBATMAN,"Well ok, that guy sounds alright"
c9gri8a,CrashRiot,"This comment is horseshit. I say that respectfully. The fact that you have more tours doesn't mean your dick is longer than his, especially because you don't know what his experience was. I myself have only been on one tour to Afghanistan and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I too have ""drank chai"" (I'm using it as a figure of speech, not sure how he was using it) with soldiers from all over the world, but no, that's not all I did. I was doing that while simultaneously (again, figure of speech) engaging in firefights, getting blown up by IED's and watching friends die. Does this make me better than your or the other gentlemen? No, because the point is we fucking went. My friend also only went on one deployment the past decade, but he also no longer has legs. Does this mean you would ridicule his opinion because he's ""only"" served one deployment?And he never mentioned that people don't have just reasons to hate the US, because only the naive would believe that. There is however a difference between bombing a target that has terrorists and there being collateral damage, and building a pressure cooker bomb to place where there are only innocent people. And no, this isn't a statement of the morality of the US's drone policies or a statement in support or against them. I'm just saying they're different situations that can't really be compared."
c9gt1w3,Robb_Reyne,"Thanks for this. You got me a little misty.I ""only"" have 2 years deployed, and I ""only"" lost 3 of my buddies.I think a lot of people don't understand how much discipline and training the US puts into not murdering innocent people, whatever mistakes are made."
c9gwx1t,jblo,"Actually they are pretty much identical situations with parallels to Iraq, as iraq was far better off before we got there. Now its a shit hole waste land with bombings happening daily, which wouldn't be happening had we not directly fucked up that country and left it the way we did. The blood of those civilians suffering is directly on the heads of the american people ."
c9gw184,Redeemed-Assassin,"Thanks for saying what you did, saved me a lot of typing and editing."
c9gtmsj,Osiriskiller,"Yeah they can, it's like comparing a double homicide to a million drunk-driving accidents. If you had to choose between which one to prevent it's a pretty easy choice. Not that you would necessarily want to not invade Iraq, but you really can compare them quite easily."

c9h30v6,NuclearDownvote,"Im not referring to his opinion of America, fuck for all i know, he could probably be one hundred percent accurate. I'm talking about his stance towards his fellow soldier on a basis of service time, its a ""who's dick is bigger"" kind of attitude that honestly could make me care less what his opinions are. His opinion isn't any truer or holds more weight than the other guys, I'm actually one hundred percent sure Dirtynate missed the point of the reference to the Chai drinking (a means to refer to the multitude of people from different cultures who work together and feel the same way as an american does during service).Its an opinion, and because someone doesn't have your's doesnt mean theirs is wrong or most honest, thats why its called an opinion - which is something I feel like your missing the point on as well."

I would *hope* a member of the armed forces would see how engaging in military targets and collateral damage isn't comparable to planting bombs at the Boston Marathon to intentionally kill civilians. The fuck. There's explaining blowback and then there's justifying terrorism, and it sounds like the latter."

They would number more than 3. Now remember that you've bombed Yugoslavia, Iraq and other nations in this manner. They died, they're not coming back. That you're ""dumbfounded"" is the problem. Its the point of the article. You are so happy to dismiss the loss because it was associated with a military goal.

If you don't see that, you're blinded by patriotism, extraordinarily naive and don't understand the implications of an armed invasion.There are no battle lines in the wars we're engaged in. There is no opposing side to negotiate with. There is no formal army that opposes us. There aren't easily-identifiable enemies, besides ""people who live there and are upset with us for being there"" - and there's certainly no such thing as a precision strike.If I broke into your house and killed your child, your wife and your dog - then said ""whoops, we really meant to raid the house next door"", you're not going to accept that as an answer. And when the US blunders about in foreign countries - killing women and children and mothers and fathers and brothers and sisters - we create martyrs and individuals who are highly-motivated to enact revenge.Cause: US killing foreign civilians. Effect: they kill our civilians.Iraq used to call the US ""The Great Satan."" We've given them - and many other countries where our troops are deployed - no reason to change their opinion. They probably don't even know what our original motivations were[*], it's likely just a body-count that they want to settle.

c9hb6tm,Burns31,"Because the motive matters, plain and simple. Accidental collateral damage in areas of terrorist activity (i.e. drone deaths) sucks, don't get me wrong, but purposely causing the death and suffering of innocent people because of an ideological/political agenda (which would be the case if the Marathon bombing is a terror attack) isn't even comparable. It's evil.Oh, and yeah it would be outrageous if Russia killed 10 U.S. citizens, but that's not quite the best analogy in my opinion to compare to the situation with our drones in the middle east, seeing as there aren't any anti-russian terror groups operating in the U.S. (as far as I know)."

That I just got back from dropping off dinner to my girl whose been working at the Boston Medical Center all damn day and the last thing anyone wants to hear about is this Muslim Terrorist bullshit. That maybe we're not all fucking drones ourselves mouth breathing in front of the television waiting for the FBI to find someone so we can publicly stone them.. That maybe we are tired from a decade of war, that our temperament has changed and that we wouldn't be so foolish to fall into the same situation we found ourselves in after 9/11.. but who am I.. I've received some of the dumbest shit on here today for only coming to the defense of my city, and my country. And guess what reddit.. Drone Strikes suck, but lets not act like there aren't atrocities going on in the Middle East and around the world which aren't our fault. But maybe we served in different countries.. cause I didn't see rainbows and daises, I saw women and children, husbands and wives persecuted by the same acts of violence we saw in Boston yesterday. Shits fucked all over.. but I'm not going to sit here and compare the type of feelings I felt yesterday to someone in Pakistan. I didn't hate Afghanistan, Iran, Al Queda, I didn't hate Islam.. I just hated that act of violence. But you can continue to spit at others on here for not understanding blowback, the proped up Mubarak regime, WMD's, or the Iranian coup, or any of the other excuses for reasons to hate America - the last thing I want is to get into that type of argument... But there are a lot of people who hate America who aren't going to drop a bomb in a trash-can, there might be reasons for rage, but there isn't an excuse for this type of violence.. no matter where you live. So take your high and mighty bullshit and your incorrect generalizations about me as a soldier and as a person and shove them up your butthole."

c9gr9sd,poonhounds,"This is true. The United States must stop targeting crowds of innocent people at sporting events with shrapnel bombs. The policy of trying to force the population of Pakistan and Afghanistan into submission by terrorizing civilians simply isn't working. If the United States used precision weapons and targeted hostile Islamic militants, then there may be some moral justification (of course, there is no such thing as an Islamic militant anyway, that's just a bunch of propaganda)."

c9gt0x4,rctsolid,Haha what the fuck? Are you some kind of retard? Drone strikes in self defense? Have you read the reports of multiple drone strikes on civilian targets in Pakistan. edit: removed 'nothing but' because that was erroneous

c9gwdog,CrashRiot,"I understand that there are civilian casualties as a result of these drone attacks, I'm not naive. However, when you wrote, ""Have you read the reports of multiple drone strikes on civilian targets in Pakistan?,"" you made it sound like the US was intentionally targeting civilians, which looking back over your comment now may not be what you meant. The US targets militant targets and only militant targets, although there are civilians in the area. So in hindsight, I think I misinterpreted your original comment. If so, my bad."
c9gwgic,rctsolid,"That's OK, I don't think the US would ever intentionally kill civilians. The US is not some evil empire. However, there have been considerable civilian deaths, which need to be answered for and they aren't being, they're being ignored."

Protest the war in general, because war is inevitably going to lead to civilian deaths."

c9gxva2,poonhounds,"56 months? You must have killed a lot of innocent people in that time, you monster. No consciencious objection? Just following orders, eh *Eichman*?"
c9gqk1k,Giants92hc,"Do you really think drones and this are similar? One is targeting terrorists and militants, the other's sole intent is to kill innocent lives. Yes, there are innocent casualties because of drone strokes, but the us doesn't bomb a group of civilians just to kill them"
c9gqy2x,vynusmagnus,"You make a good point, that the US doesn't intend to kill civilians and children, but you miss the larger picture. To the people that lose their loved ones (I mean innocents, not actual terrorists) to a US drone strike, do you think they give a fuck what our intentions were? I doubt it."
c9gr1d2,Giants92hc,"I understand that loved ones would be angry, but that doesn't change the fact that the intent of the attacks are very different. Yes there are casualties, and yes, families of innocents will be hurt, but that's a fact of war, and has no real bearing on the topic of my post, which was the targets of attacks. In WW2, we would carpet bomb cities, killing tons of innocents. Drone strikes are much more accurate and effective."
c9gr8vy,vynusmagnus,"I think it does have a lot to do with the topic, because the person you were responding to was talking about how US policies are causing a lot of this aggression against us. Also, your WWII analogy doesn't hold up. In WWII, we were at war with Germany and Japan (and a few others). Last I checked, we're not at war with a lot of these countries we use drone strikes against, such as Pakistan and Yemen."
c9gracn,Giants92hc,"I was responding specifically to the part where he said that this bomb was the equivalent to a drone strike. The ww2 criticism is fair, and I don't think we should be launching attacks in areas that are not declared areas of conflict."
c9grcfo,vynusmagnus,Fair enough.
c9grcqz,LibAtheist,That is the exact same logic the person who did this probably believes in and it's morally abhorrent.
c9grpe4,Giants92hc,How is that the logic of a killer? All I said was there is a difference between the killing of innocents (absolutely bad) and the killing of military targets.
c9grto2,LibAtheist,"If this was a terrorist attack, the perpetrator/s were engaged in combat and the civilian casualties are just a part of doing business. Same as the logic of our country when we blow up madrasas to get one person and then blow up the first responders. All just part of defeating the enemy. Violence begets violence."
c9grx65,Giants92hc,"That's not how terrorist attacks work. If this was a terrorist attack, the civilian casualties were the whole point of the attack."
c9grhfx,Mimehunter,"Is there a difference between ""not intending to kill innocents"" and ""knowing innocents will die but doing it anyway""?I mean, don't we intend it? We're not *that* oblivious; we just think it's worth it."
c9grle5,vynusmagnus,"That's a good question. I'm not in the military, but I'm sure every operation has some sort of acceptable casualty rate. I wouldn't be surprised if the same goes for civilian deaths from drones. That said, I don't think we intend to kill them, but we see it as acceptable."
c9grnyj,Mimehunter,I guess I don't see the distinction as being all that important.
c9grviq,vynusmagnus,"Neither do I, that was my original point. If another country kills my family in a drone strike, I don't care what the reason, they've just made a life-long enemy."
c9gqqjt,bigroblee,Bullshit.

c9grmnp,Giants92hc,"What's your point? I know civilians are killed, I'm not arguing that. Killing civilians is bad, yes. All I'm saying is that the intent is not to kill innocent civilians for the sake of killing. Your second source supports what I'm saying in the first paragraph:>For nearly four years, the United States has been using unmanned aerial vehicles, also known as “drones,” to repeatedly bomb targets in Pakistan. [1] The drone strikes, operated primarily by the CIA, are reportedly launched with the intention of killing top al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders and holding the Pakistani government accountable. Since the Obama administration has taken office, the U.S. campaign of drone strikes in Pakistan has markedly intensified, consistent with the trends established in the final eight months President Bush's second term. Although the bombings of Pakistan fall into a much broader strategic U.S. policy in the region, it is the purpose of this analysis to focus solely on the legal implications and human costs of the drone strikes in Pakistan."
c9grobj,bigroblee,They target groups of military age men with no proof whatsoever that they are militants or any threat to the United States or US forces in any way. This would be the equivalent of terrorist attacks on groups of men on US soil. No different.
c9grtob,Giants92hc,"All I see in your evidence is that there is conflicting information about how the US classifies casualties, not that the US specifically targets anyone in the 18-40 year range or whatever."
c9grwh5,bigroblee,"Well, we could look at the direct US rules of engagement to determine how they decide on targets... oh, wait, no we can't; they've classified that.We are the terrorists in this situation (I'm American). Why is this so fucking hard for you to accept?"
c9grzhf,Giants92hc,just because the rules of engagement are classified doesn't mean that it's automatically terrorism. I agree that there should be oversight. All I am saying is that the intent of drone strikes are different than the intent of terrorist attacks.
c9gs03b,bigroblee,I don't agree. You don't have enough information to make that statement as factual.
c9gs2o4,Giants92hc,That's probably a fair statement. But it works the other way as well. We can't say we are terrorists and targeting innocent civilians because there isn't enough info
c9gr7ln,play_a_record,"tl;dr *""Oops, sorry bro. We were totes tryna kill a terrorist...""* isn't sufficient."

c9grlxf,play_a_record,Is Pakistan entitled to bomb the US if they claim they're going after terrorists?
c9grnra,Giants92hc,"I don't think the US is entitled to be bombing Pakistan, and that's not what I'm arguing. All I'm saying is that there is a difference between targeting terrorists (or known terrorists, there should be more oversight) and killing civilians for the sake of killing."

c9gr6lw,yeariterite,"The motivation is different. The consequences are similar. People act based on consequences usually, not motivations.

c9grctr,Giants92hc,"That is true, but that's a natural cost of all war. Yes, killing innocents is bad, obviously, but any method of eliminating targets will most likely result in civilian casualties. Targeting civilians is different than collateral damage."
c9grpyp,yeariterite,"I'm with you, it's just not that different in the eyes of the victims and their families, so we shouldn't expect them to just sit with arms crossed. We also should not stop empathizing with them just because they happen to live or be born in a 'war zone.'"
c9grxzh,Giants92hc,"O, I know. Everyone thinks I think that the civilian casualties are okay and shouldn't care about them. That's not what I'm saying. All I said was there is that terrorist attacks and drone strikes are not equivalent in their intent."
c9gsddi,yeariterite,"Word. Though I think what you're trying to say is:""Terrorist attacks against innocent civilians and drone strikes are not equivalent in their intent.""The article makes a valid point that drone strikes could be considered terrorist attacks, because the definition of what a terrorist attack is is interpreted in many different ways. Some of the most common uses would in fact encompass our drone strikes, use of cluster bombs, etc."

We should not be policing the world the way we do and our government is as corrupt as any other. When I first read the article I was all ""who are you to say these things days after this attack?"" Then i stopped to think about what was actually being said and remembered a lot of the shit our country does is just as bad. But our attitude is that we're America so we're allowed to do whatever we want because we're morally sound and that's just not true. We shouldn't do whatever we please when it comes to foreign policy and our moral compass (reffering to our government) is not pointing due north.

c9gqitp,berylthranox,"The horrible things that happen in that area of the world are the result of policies from the early 19th century. I'm not saying that any blame can be laid at your feet personally but if you are part of an organization that tries to avoid prosecuting a man that cuts off children's fingers for war trophies then you can expect to have some rage directed at you. Blame the people that actually do bad things and acknowledge that some of those people were over there for the exact same reasons that you were and didn't handle themselves as well as you claim to have. Bad things happen and if you believe that extremist groups based in the U.S. won't take advantage of this event to justify violence around the world then you are naive. Once people find a group to blame there will be a backlash just as there has already been a backlash against Arabs. I've known people that donated their pay to fund a Christmas celebration for orphans in Vietnam during the war. That wasn't entirely uncommon but what struck me was that he died without telling anyone about it and his friend, that donated his pay too, told the story at his funeral. You were part of an organization that is capable of treating people with justice and gentleness yet will knowingly obscure acts of deliberate violence directed toward civilians. TL;DR GrossFatty below me is right in saying that all of these situations originate with western culture but no one deserves what happened in Boston. The heroism that occurred just after the attacks will be eclipsed by fear mongering and that is the reality of American Journalism."
c9gqn3r,ActuallyNot,"OTOH, I'm not even in your hemisphere, and the papers and google news threads are all over this Boston bombing.On the *same day*, bombs killed 16 times as many people in Iraq, but the media articles are pushed from the front page.Why is one American so much more important than 16 Iraqis?Is it that there are photos of the Boston bombings, or is there an underlying racism here?Probably both, but neither speaks well of us."

c9gqnr0,,"I think either you misinterpreted the article or I'm misinterpreting your comment. The author isn't suggesting that the streets of Boston are filled with people raging, but I think it's fair to say that there's widespread anger, and some of it is clearly [misdirected, violent and extreme](http://publicshaming.tumblr.com/post/48093470152/two-explosives-went-off-at-the-boston-marathon-on). While there might be problems with comparing the US military's actions with those of the bomber, there are parallels (e.g. the 'double tap') that invite comparison. When the message of the article is a call for greater empathy, and understanding of the feelings of those who experience this sort of thing all the time (e.g. the bombings with 3x the casualties in Iraq around the same time) I think it's a reasonable comparison to make. That said, I think more respect could be given so soon after a tragedy like this. The author seems to be aiming criticism at the US government/military, but at a time like this when people want to pull together, criticising them feels like an attack on US citizens, and there has already been one too many of those."
c9gqo6g,dsruix,"From a completely outside perspective, I think that there is some credence to the statement. But it's more about the unnecessary wars that America has a penchant for entering into, wars that, because of America's world power, pull the rest of the world in too. I'll give America the Afghanistan war. 911 was orchestrated by a regime as an unconventional attack on American soil. The backlash was expected. But, America marketed it as an act of terror and declared a war on terrorism. That, in my opinion, was the dumbest political move in decades. Terrorism is built on fear theatre. Publicizing the terror aspect only made terrorists more bold. I'd be willing to bet that the rise in terrorist activity in the wake of 911 occurred as a direct result of 911 being a successful terrorist attack, not because it managed to kill so many people, but because it succeeded in creating an atmosphere of fear around the world. This atmosphere was created in part by the way America labeled the attack and the way America, the largest world superpower, gamely participated in fear theatre. Then there was the Iraq war. You can always point towards the fact that Saddam was leading an evil genocidal regime, which it was. Yet that was not exactly the reason why the us went to war there. It was their reaction to fear theatre. They decided to put on security theatre (which really only fuels fear theatre) on the basis that Iraq had wmds that were a threat to America. Yet this war comes as just another war in the long game of American meddling within the region. America has a penchant for installing dictators and then coming back to topple them in the middle east. This brings me to how I see America. There's a reason why America draws so much animosity. It's because America is the big Jock who loves to stick his hand into everyone's affairs without bothering to wait for the rest of the student council to decide on the best course of action. America is brash and that brashness leads it to war constantly, often in reaction to previous wars as a way to correct it's mistakes."
c9gqod3,joskebangelijk,"I think it's more of a reaction to the media outlets going on about muslim terrorrism and or suspects. How two arab men were escorted of an airplane for being overheard speaking arab to eachother, that kind of stuff...How there is this whole misinformation going on about the origin of the bomber/how many bombs how media fall over themselves to be the first to report something and rather just make wild claims rather than to check facts.thirdly, the most important part is the last part, the one stating that civil liberties should be safe guarded by the people and not let themselves be cowed into more laws being written to prevent such things by taking away civil rights.you focussed on one issue it brings up, and the article does so in a contrived and awkward fashion. But, I am not American but my girlfriend lives near Boston, I don't know what your country is going through, but there's this whole don't joke about this atmosphere going on on not only reddit but imgur and some other social media outlets. These things happen the world over, it's not because it happened in your country it is more dramatic than it happened in another country, it's just closer to home. I shat bricks when I heard it because I knew my girlfriend was in Boston, but on the other hand after the relief I felt myself not really caring that much. Why? because it's not in my backyard. Which is the same for a lot of other tragedies going on in the world, so maybe take a look at how you react and how you feel, and think about other people being indignified by very tame reactions in the US to their daily drama."

c9gqqps,panjialang,">No other group reacts with that level of fear to these kinds of incidents, because no other group has similar cause to fear that they will all be hated or targeted for the acts of isolated, unrepresentative individuals. A similar dynamic has long prevailed in the domestic crime context: when the perpetrators of notorious crimes turned out to be African-American, the entire community usually paid a collective price. But the unique and well-grounded dread that hundreds of millions of law-abiding, peaceful Muslims and Arabs around the world have about the prospect that this attack in Boston was perpetrated by a Muslim highlights the climate of fear that has been created for and imposed on them over the last decade."

Only when we see this can we start to understand the problem. This article was trying to make that point. It is not good against evil. It is passion against passion."

c9grrqo,BawbDowl,Actually the bombing is very similar to our nation's foreign policy. [Here's](http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2011/07/18/washingtons-untrue-claims-no-civilian-deaths-in-pakistan-drone-strikes/) a list of civilian casualties in drone strikes alone. Imagine if the bomber(s) is caught and argues his attack was justified because there were a few terrorists in the crowd?
c9gruji,freckledme,"All the article is attempting to address is to not point the finger at some ""innocent until proven guilty party. "" the fact of the matter is we have no evidence at all at the moment to go off of to help us identify who is responsible for this horrific act of violence. The article is asking us to remain calm and level headed so that we do not blame a group of people as a whole for one individuals heartlessness. Your passion and service are greatly appreciated. It's people's hatred and people's ability to so quickly classify an entire religion as being responsible for a signal act of violence. It may prove a Muslim is responsible for this horrific act of violence but as a human with compassion for your country, loved ones, and fellow Americans I would just hope that you would have compassion in your heart to realize that one of your loved ones or fellow Americans are being lumped into into the classification."

I'll shoot any motherfckers who invade my state no matter what kind of bs excuse they give me. Anyway, it's just the survival of richest.

This might hurt your eyes to read but there are actual people out there with legitimate reasons to hate the American government. Its so much more than just a bandwagon to jump on. Is it uncool to like the Boston bomber? Or am I trivialising the issue so any serious conversation about the matter can stop here?

c9gszah,Donkeytonk,Try reading the article mate. The only reason your comment has so many up votes is because American redditors outweigh most other countries.The point he's getting at is there is outpouring of (rightly so) condolence to this incident but no one gives a shit when a bomb goes off in Baghdad or USA uses weapons to kill the secondary arrivals helping injured at a bomb strike at a bomb strike
c9gt0oz,Budikah,I'm sure once or if they find somebody to blame then you will see plenty of anger and hatred.
c9gt1dx,BolshevikMuppet,"There's also a difference in intent, and a significant one at that. America in its current military engagements have attempted to limited civilian morbidity and mortality, and to reduce harm to civilian infrastructure.

c9gt2mv,,I That's not what he said at all.. You got it so wrong it's fucking retarded. He commended the positive responses and said similar thoughts and concerns should be addressed to other events worldwide.

c9gtbsf,moeloubani,"Anyone in Al Qaeda would say the same thing you just said but to you. They would say they spread religion, they feed the hungry and fight off terrorism from the US.So let's step back and instead of looking at what people are saying let's look at the facts.You are saying it's okay to kill people when you are the US because of reason x y z.Everyone else is saying it's never okay to be someone that kills another person. And you think your views are the right views?"
c9gtff6,band_ofthe_hawk92,"You're entirely right. The tone of the article is condescending, and he has no right to criticize what our country is doing. It's not like we're killing for sport or for our own gain (read: our huge debt from the wars), we're bringing stability and democracy to the region. He's equating us with terrorists, which is plain wrong. We don't kill for no reason. Are there unnecessary casualties? Yes, but that's the reality of war. War has a rational higher purpose; this terrorist has no rational higher purpose.Also, thank you for your service."

Nor is the Guantanamo situation.I am not advocating for the Middle East, and there is nothing *good* about any terrorist attack, but those that are ignorant to world politics or even general knowledge that is taught in schools around the world will continue to think along those lines and commit hate crimes. Americans, need to be educated about the world just as much as the rest of us. But the arrogance of being ""the most powerful country"" hinders it. For example, the first man to be **murdered** out of complete rage after 9/11 was a Sikh, barely 12 years back. So no. There isn't much of a difference between how the two regions handle their anger, and even though I'll get slacked for this, America is just as much to blame for needless war as the rest of the world. There is a reason (there is always a reason) why the ""America is evil circle-jerk"" exists and its completely down to its own actions. I could go into detail about how every American President has gone to war of some kind, whether necessary or not, but I'll leave it up to you to read up on.Again, I'm not saying America is evil or any of that shit, and I have just as much sympathy for the victims of the Boston attacks as the rest of the U.S., but my point is please don't try to portray America as a country that is head and heels above the rest of the world, because that is completely false."

It's the patriotic thing to do to call out when your government does wrong things and resist it (sorry if that's not macho enough for you).

c9goht6,Noly12345,"I've always felt that mental deficiencies are a poor excuse for avoiding punishment and anger. If a man is willing to murder or attempt to murder hundreds of people (within special circumstances, of course, Just War Theory and all...), it is safe to say his way of thinking is deficient with respect to morality. So somebody is legally defined as a psychopath, and we treat them better than somebody who is sane? A sane person is more likely to listen to reason and not re-offend in some way or another, recidivism rates for the insane are much [higher](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/asylums/etc/faqs.html). We ought not pity them, because this leads to better treatment. They are more deserving of punishment than the sane, because the sane are less likely to reoffend.Yes, I realize we cannot hold them at fault for their mental deficiencies, but this does not free them from the burden of these deficiencies, the world is not that happy of a place."
c9gp9pi,marinersalbatross,Punishment is designed to teach someone a lesson. A mentally I'll person is unable to learn that lesson and therefore you want to punish them more? What is wrong with you? That is the reasoning of a sadist. Why not try to treat the illness rather than punish? It would lower the recidivism rate.
c9gr9y2,Noly12345,"Well our current system is not designed to teach a lesson, but to punish. We have a retributive justice system (as a general rule, yes, we have rehabilitative elements also) so its primary purpose is to punish, with of course the addition of keeping the dangerous away from society. I am not saying make them suffer more, I am saying do not let them re-offend, and both longer incarceration periods or rehabilitation would achieve this end much better than putting them back out on the streets early. Rehabilitation would be wonderful if we could pull it off, Norway's restorative system seems to do a beautiful job of that and if we could mimic it, then I would advocate for sending the mentally ill in the criminal justice system there. This is not the reality here in America though, and we cannot act on such a falsehood and expect good results."

c9gw0so,pijjin,"So many people misinterpreting the point of the article it seems. What happened in Boston was a tragedy, and you and everyone else has every right to be sad about it. The point is that the horrible stories of families being torn apart and limbs being blown off are precisely the kinds of thing that happen every few days over on the other side of the world, and too often at the hands of Americans. Every time an American drone accidentally sends a missile into a group of innocent civilians, similar scenes of carnage, emotion and devastation result, and yet when it's not white people, nobody seems to give a shit. Why is there such a disconnect that we pour out grief (as we should!) when something horrible like this happens in the west, but we just turn a blind eye when we're the ones doing the killing in some far away land.If Obama would show even a fraction of the same amount of sadness and emotion that he did over the Boston bombings when he heard news of Iraqi civilians dying in American bomb blasts or missile strikes, would it be policy that [all military age males in a strike zone are automatically assumed to be terrorists?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/29/drone-attacks-innocent-civilians_n_1554380.html) What the fuck are we doing?Yes, be sad about what happened in Boston. But for all the horror stories that we hear coming out of Boston, remember that for some this kind of bullshit is a daily reality, and that even if it's not always us with our fingers on the trigger, it is our war mongering that has destabilised that region in the first place. As well as sadness we should feel shame for what the west does. And maybe we shouldn't be so shocked that if we go off charging around the world, blowing people up in the name of freedom, sometimes in response there will be a call of 'death to the west'."

And why wouldn't that reason apply to those in the U.K. on the dole, or those in the rest of Europe living off of the ""social safety net""?> Or wanting to marry other girls.It was legal in the U.S. before it was legal in France, since France only legalized it 4 days ago.Does that mean the U.S. should not further improve?

c9hl2aj,skwirrlmaster,You're using a fallacy. That's a false equivalence. The difference in education girls were getting in the US versus boys is completely different from girls not being allowed to learn to read so they are servile to their men.

Is our record spotless, or can you point out your own examples?I'm not going to write a book, to make my point. I'm going to quickly point out examples, and ask you the reader to fill in the blanks.The lack of advanced education for women meant that there were only certain jobs they could hold. After World War II, women were expected to *leave* the jobs they had stepped up to fill, so that the *boys coming home* could have a job.Women were definitely second-class citizens in the country.That even this **obvious point** is controversial is mind-blowing.And great job responding to **voting** and **holding office.**A woman who *can't vote* is a woman who *can't vote.* Is that a false equivalence? **Yes or no?**Respond to those points to prove how smart you are. Remember, you've set the bar to the **1300s** in the Americas. Can you defend it, or was it **hyperbole**?> If they wanted to learn they didn't acid thrown in their face.You accidentally a word there, which makes your last paragraph ironic.And yeah, we didn't throw acid in women's faces.

c9gpzt0,keeganspeck,"We didn't abandon our responsibility to hold the government accountable, it was taken from us by both chronic deception over countless decades and incredible amounts of money poured into the political system from the powerful minority.Our ability to change things on a democratic level was forced from us long ago, and even enormous grassroots movements like Occupy Wall Street couldn't do anything tangible; all we're able to to now is bring the issue up and be shamed for it by the rich and the powerful.

c9gvdvx,Mensketh,"You know what people in developing countries do when they dont like what the government is doing? General strikes, they shut the whole economy down, the people still have the power, ultimately the people always have the power if they choose to exercise it.

People do have the power to change what they dont like, but Americans and the citizens of most other developed countries would rather pass the buck, say its not their fault, their vote didnt matter, because the system is corrupt and go back to watching tv. No one is willing to take any real action if it inconveniances them in any way."

Even *massive* strikes wouldn't do anything on the national scale, everything would go back to normal in an instant. You can't shut the US economy down with strikes. What are we striking against? Every single corporation? How? Those with power in the US are the most powerful in the world, especially from an inequality standpoint, and they influence politics on a systemic scale. Thinking we could just *strike* to change the way our government does its military is very naive. We spend more in that sector than the next 20 countries combined, more even.

The majority of the American public is not interested in seeing trials for torture, they are not interested in effective intelligence agency oversight, and they don't even want to know about the crimes the United States has committed over the past century.

Take a look at the graph here: http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2005/09/the_changing_ag.htmlNotice how the average age was much younger 40 years ago? That's the kind of population you need in order to continuously pump out legislation that's thinking about the future. Instead we've got the opposite happening. The baby boomers are not only outnumbering young adults but they are hanging around longer. Over half of our population is thinking that their lives are closer to the end than the beginning. Is it any wonder why we seem like such a short sighted country?Combine that with the fact that our politicians are vultures preying on the opportunity and you get a pretty good picture of the current political scene.

And, believe it or not, they consider it perfectly acceptable for there to be multiple innocents amongst the kill, which they define as ""collateral damage.""There have been 176 children in Pakistan alone killed by such attacks in the last few years, many under Obama's watch. And then you see him and others saying how their prayers will be with the victims of such a senseless act (Boston bombings) and how it's impossible to understand such atrocities. Really? Where are his tears and prayers for those 176 children? Where are America's?Of course this is just the tip of the iceberg... Since WW2 America has been extremely effective in murder or ""acts of terror."" The latest war in Iraq was illegal and resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians. Still not a single person has been brought to justice, most have simply forgot and moved on. And yet the second America is ""attacked"" the World ends. 3 people lose their lives (a tragedy upon itself) and the perpetrators ""will be found and brought to justice.""Like I said most Americans seem clueless about the terror they have inflicted upon millions of people through unnecessary wars. I've seen multiple comments on here saying how they ""understand America has a bad foreign policy in some respects"" or how America ""never directly targets civilians."" Both may be true, but are completely and utterly missing the point"

c9h2d5g,thelatedent,"But I think taking the decisions and policies of the UN out of their particular contexts is probably ""stupider,"" if that's the word we're going to use. Saying that some policy or other comes from the UN and does therefore not belong to the United States ignores the fundamental power structures of the UN itself, and the influence that the United States (and special interest groups therein) has on the decisions reached by the UN and particular UN special councils. Obviously no decision is reached entirely by dint of US interests, but many decisions are made in order to appease certain US interests so that other nations might get representatives from the US to agree to other policies of their liking. It's a complicated and large body of people, but the US has particular influence in it, and often enough influence that it would be fair to say that certain UN policies are simply US policies recontextualized."

In fact, I was trying to target your kid...I meant to kill your 8 yr old son, and maim you and your daughter as well, along with as many other innocent non-combatants at that charity event as I could manage.""I don't like our foreign policy either, but to compare the one mentality to the other is utterly ludicrous. For every death you can chalk up to U.S. military action, you can point to some sort of objective they had other than causing civilian casualties (even though some of them seem flimsy). For random acts of violence such as the one we saw yesterday, you can't offer up even the weakest justification."

c9gscqi,CallMeLargeFather,"Why then is there a distinction between murder and manslaughter?Someone driving drunk is also a bad example unless our soldiers are told to operate while inebriated. So, Let's take the drunk part out of your question:Would I be willing to forgive someone if they were driving and made a bad decision that resulted in the death of a family member? Yes, if it was clear that they did not mean to kill someone than I could forgive them (definitely not right away, but I could).Would I be willing to forgive someone for murdering a family member? Fuck no."
c9gsm95,DoctorLeroy,"The point is, a tragedy is a tragedy. Innocents dieing causes grief to all those involved regardless of the intentions of the one who caused it. If my family was killed by a bomb, I doubt I would give a shit whether it was on purpose or not."

I do know that I could never forgive someone who intentionally killed my family...and might even feel the urge to exact vengeance (not claiming this the the right or rational thing to do). I think the murder vs. manslaughter comparison is quite apt. You're right though...it's a tragedy either way."
c9gsue2,CallMeLargeFather,Well then I guess we are different. I would definitely feel differently towards the bomber if he intentionally killed my family.

Look at it this way: The United States is acting in such a way that the deaths caused are both accidental and incurred while protecting something of value. Now compare that to a lone or small group of individuals acting to harm without protecting anything of value as a terrorist group is equal to a country.

c9gro1o,c4pathway,The ideas are based from Locke and Rousseau. A state has a social contract with its people that gives its actions legitimacy. A [non-state actor] does not have that. By the sole fact that we have an elected government that represents 300 million plus people our actions hold more legitimacy that those of a small extremist sect of [non-state actor] peoples who are acting not to further a protective mandate but to harm [non-acting] members of said legitimate state. Furthermore we are acting with a protective mandate. We are acting with an intent to stop or in some other way slowdown violence towards our people. That is the Social Contract we agreed to. We agreed to specific things [adherence laws and taxes] in exchange for protection. [Non-state actors] act in such a way as to cause harm and violence not in a protective manner. **To Summarize**They are wrong twofold. 1) [Non-state actors] do not have a social contract and they therefore are not on the same level as a state representing people who are bound by social contract. 2)[Non-state actors] are acting in such a way as to cause violence and harm to members of a state with no protective mandate of their own. **TL;DR**Fuck terrorism the fact that we are a country allows us to root our those who wish to do us harm and confront them in any way we see fit.

The tactic involves bombing a target multiple times in relatively quick succession, meaning that the second strike often hits first responders.Look, is there really any harm in U.S. citizens at least acknowledging we do wrong things? If we remain in denial, we'll never change.**Disclaimer for idiots**: I don't condone terror attacks for any reason."

We are fighting an enemy with no uniform no identifying features that hides among the civilian population. **If they want the bombs to stop they can stop harboring those who wish to do us harm**. The only alternative is for their country to handle the problem which it is not. This is not an ideal scenario, but it is the scenario we are dealing with.3) Collateral Damage is actually defined as incidental damage to non-target nouns. We are aiming at the terrorists.

c9gradq,TristanIsAwesome,"I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion, but I have to say that I disagree with your assessment. ""The terrorists"" (at least the ones in the Middle East; not sure about this Boston guy(s) - he (they) could have a mental illness) *are* trying to protect and preserve what they see as the correct way to live, what they see as their culture. They absolutely see the Western (read: American) lifestyle and culture as a threat to their own. They see US civilians as enemy combatants and targets. There is no collateral damage because civilians are targets. They see it as a state of [Total War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_war). They aren't just murderous thugs, at least not as they see it.Now compare that to the US. We are trying to target these guys specifically because we *don't* see it as a state of total war. Thats why we sometimes accidentally kill non-combatants. I guess I'd change your TL;DR to the following:**USA Violence *against specific enemies* to protect and preserve *by means of intentional death and harm* + collateral damage as an accident****Terrorism is violence to protect and preserve (as they see it) *by means of intentional death and harm* to all enemies in a Total War situation**Its possible/probable that I haven't explained myself well (I'm not very eloquent) but I'd love to hear thoughts rather than just getting downvoted."
c9gs1gi,c4pathway,"I am saying that on a totally objective tableau rasa slate the terrorists actions and motivations are worth less because they are not acting *for* a group of people but rather are making decisions on an extremist and, largely (globally) unsupported level. Also the term collateral damage is defined as not accidental but unintentional. Rather that the damage potential is known and accounted for but the outcome that would cause the collateral damage is worth the collateral damage. **For Example: Posting about terrorism is worth 3 karma, but when post you accidentally piss off another redditor you get -1 karma.

c9gp597,Dionysious,When it comes down to it I bet you're more likely to side with the U.S. as opposed to those the U.S. demonizes.
c9gp8w4,frinkendoof,"But I can still see what is clearly a breach of human rights and international law and not see something as purely black vs white. Patriotism is fine but you can hardly call the U.S government angelic, at times it can be downright evil."

c9gq5g1,bpj1805,"War? Who is at war? When last did the US declare war?Granted, I'm playing the dictionary game there, but only one of the belligerents agreed to this ""war"".

c9gp26a,Dionysious,Give me an example of the U.S. actively pursuing and trying to kill civilians during peace time. Go ahead.
c9gp4oy,SlunkMaster,"Considering we've pretty much been in war constantly for the last 100 years or longer, yes."
c9gpddd,EUPRAXIA1,We haven't been on a war footing that long. One hundred years ago was actually still a few year from our getting involved in World War I. And we were for the most part still very isolationist at that time and even before World War II. After that though is when we agreed to join a UN type body and exert our influence rather than go back to isolationism. (Which I think might not be such a bad thing to do in all honesty.)
c9gp9bf,Beetle559,Then why is it such a big deal when it happens in Boston?Be logically consistent.
c9gptqh,,I didn't realize Boston was a war zone.
c9gq6w4,Beetle559,That's it then?The people in this geographical area are in a war zone so their deaths are of little meaning. Their families and communities shouldn't be so butthurt that they just got struck by a US missile?
c9gpmhk,veiron,"it's terrorism it happens, how about you get real?"
c9gpsq3,Dionysious,"Again, key difference: defenseless civilians are being intentionally targeted."
c9gq20y,veiron,Like in Dresden?
c9gq62u,Dionysious,"You can take that to the international court and the state of war would trump that charge. Fucked up, yea but it was within the confines of the law. This event in Boston would not."
c9gqe1p,veiron,"Probably, but you can't take the US to court in the Hague since the cowards (sorry, I still like you guys) hasn't signed the Geneva convention. So it could be a war crime, but the US is to aware that they do war crimes that they wont sign any treaties against it. Well, thats a bit of a simplification but hey.. its 04.26 here and I should really get some sleep.Neither has the terrorists btw, and we all know that the laws doesn't work as usual on them. If they can be kept in prison without a trail, whats stopping them from comitting normal crimes. The rules are off."

Whether or not you think the collateral damage from the drone program is justified, there's a huge difference between collateral damage and senseless damage. When US soldier Robert Bales massacred 16 innocent Afghan villagers the story saturated the US media and there was an outpouring of empathy. It wasn't as big of a story as the Boston attack is, but it's obvious that people were far more empathetic when the killings were senseless rather than collateral. Even if the reality of the event is the same for the victims, drone strikes are viewed by many in the West as advancing the common good, and can be rationalized with the [just-world fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_fallacy). But that fallacy doesn't kick in when the killings are senseless, and people are left with raw anger and sadness that can't be rationalized.I get what he's trying to say, but I have a very low tolerance for people who immediately use tragedies to advance their own political agendas, and this article is right on the edge of triggering that."

Where is the praise for Breivik? He single-handedly without helps of bombs (talking about the island now) killed in a calm manor over 60 people. Where is his medal for bravery?Senseless killing is senseless killings and should be condemned equally.

c9gpvna,arv98s,Would you care to explain that? I have never heard that saying before.
c9gqdf2,supermancer,"[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_dilemma) is black and white thinking.Saying ""It's [subject] [day of the week]"" expresses that whatever subject is used has been so prevalent or dominant recently that it qualifies as the theme of the day."

c9gs657,jjjaaammm,"Yeah, completely relevant retort. Bravo."
c9gsbhb,emizeko,Worship authoritarian daddy some more
c9gsn4o,jjjaaammm,Oh you.
c9gqm3h,grievern,"You are completely right that there is a difference. However, there's still something to say about the American government fabricating a false story about nuclear weapons as a justification to invade an entire country and cause the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians. At some point, it doesn't matter if we don't *intend* to kill civilians. We're still actively engaging in a war that had no justification to happen in the first place; a war that we *know* will continue to cause the deaths of thousands of innocent people. As long as we are in these countries, causing unrest with our military presence and actions, we cannot absolve ourselves of the responsibility for civilian deaths, no matter the intent.Your argument, while true, does not make the war in Iraq less evil than some crazy guy bombing marathon runners. I know you didn't say that, but a lot of ignorant people can and will conclude that by utilizing your argument."
c9gqsxw,jjjaaammm,"If you think we fabricated a false story about nuclear weapons to justify the invasion, then I understand where you are coming from."
c9gr3mn,grievern,I don't just think that. It's true.
c9grffg,jjjaaammm,"With all due respect, saying something is true, does not make it so. Faulty intelligence by two separate administrations and various other partner countries, in addition to violations of the agreements which ended the first gulf war (violations which made it specifically hard to determine weapons capability) were the underlying justifications for the invasion. Being wrong (or even incompetent) and lying are two separate things. (BTW your down votes did not come from me.)"
c9greuu,joskebangelijk,"jjjaaammm, the U.S. was forbidden by the united nations to go into a war theater in Iraq. Making your war an illegal incursion of a foreign nation.Meaning it is a terrorrist act.Secondly there is ample proof that the WMD argument was contrived by the Bush administration.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_and_the_Iraq_Warhttp://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004_11/DuelferI could come up with more sources if you like."
c9grust,YouShallKnow,"I know right! Remember when the UN punished the US for the illegal war? That was awesome! /end sarcasmIf you call an invasion and occupation terrorism, you really don't understand the basic definition of terrorism. I think it's clear that the Bush administration fudged the intelligence; for me the question is whether they *knew* they were wrong. I think most of them were true believers and would have bet the farm on Iraq having WMD. So I think they lied righteously; they fudged the intel but they genuinely thought Iraq had WMD. But I also think that they didn't really care if they were right, because invading Iraq accomplished geopolitical goals even if they were wrong about WMD. But they had to have known that launching a war on a lie would eventually be found out, and would eventually hurt their political brand significantly, thus restricting their power and influence. As it turned out, neocons have never since obtained electoral power and likely never will. So it seems unlikely to me they knew Iraq didn't have WMD and invaded anyway."
c9gs3dg,joskebangelijk,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorismif you go by that definition: Common definitions of terrorism refer only to those violent acts which are intended to create fear (terror); are perpetrated for a religious, political or, ideological goal; and deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (civilians).Any full scale invasion kind of falls under that category even if it is a legal war, so an illegal war is kind of... just that.thirdly, yes the international community didn't even slap America on the wrist, why? because they're the big bully in the playground. Getting away with something isn't the same as being in the right to do so.They did fudge up the Intel, and there is some mention by various articles and higher ups involved in the war that the administration did know about the lack of evidence. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_AgencyThe AEA, was pulled from the country days before the invasion and they clearly stated that they had inspected numerous facillities unexpectedly and found no trace of WMD's also the facilities that were shown as being the Facilities housing the WMD's were inspected by the agency weeks before the invasion. I would find it hard to believe the Bush Administration did not know about this."
c9gsbho,YouShallKnow,">Any full scale invasion kind of falls under that category even if it is a legal war, so an illegal war is kind of... just that.How does an invasion fall under that category? You just restated your thesis.The point of the invasion is not intended to create fear, was not done for religious, political, or ideological grounds, and civilians were not deliberately targeted or disregarded. >thirdly, yes the international community didn't even slap America on the wrist, why? Because the US has veto power in the UN and there's no other international body that could possibly harm the US. I suppose all the other countries could have gotten together and stopped trading with us in punishment; but that would be too bad for them and they really didn't feel that strongly about our wrongdoing. >because they're the big bully in the playground.So what, we would have like nuked France if they stopped trading with us in protest? >Getting away with something isn't the same as being in the right to do so.I didn't say it was. I was making fun of your point that the war was illegal under UN rules; so what? Who cares? The UN's rules are meaningless in this context. Not only did they not prevent the invasion, they weren't used to punish us for the invasion. >They did fudge up the Intel, and there is some mention by various articles and higher ups involved in the war that the administration did know about the lack of evidence. Yeah, I agree. I just think they may have *believed* that Iraq really did have WMD, despite their knowledge that they had no evidence. I think they were as surprised as anyone when the invasion turned up no WMD. The AEA said that they hadn't found anything, but if you remember Saddam kept blocking them for certain places. In fact, Saddam did everything possible to pretend he had WMD, both to stave off an attack from us and to exaggerate their power to the rest of the region. I'm not saying that was reason to invade; I'm just saying that it's possible that the neocons believed Iraq had WMD even if they knew there was no evidence and they were fabricating the intel to sell the war. >I would find it hard to believe the Bush Administration did not know about this.They did know, and they also knew the inspectors were restricted access from numerous facilities and did not have free reign. If Saddam had WMD he could have hid them from the inspectors."
c9gsez2,joskebangelijk,"The UN's rules are very meaningful in this context, it means that whatever international law says or the organ that dictates legality of international warfare that the U.S. is going to do whatever the fuck it wants. Making the whole argument that terrorists use whatever means possible to hurt people kind of a mute point.The WMD's were a strawman from the start and even Bush in the end kind of admitted it later on.But it's getting late and I have work in the morning, if you want to dig deeper into this I'll gladly respond but it will be tomorrow at the earliest."
c9gsj9w,YouShallKnow,">The UN's rules are very meaningful in this context, it means that whatever international law says or the organ that dictates legality of international warfare that the U.S. is going to do whatever the fuck it wants. Right, which means, the UNs rules are meaningless. We're agreeing, I'm not sure why you think we're not. >Making the whole argument that terrorists use whatever means possible to hurt people kind of a mute point.First, it's ""moot"" point, junior. Second, how does the UN's inefficacy at preventing illegal war make the ""argument"" that terrorists target innocent civilians moot? >The WMD's were a strawman from the start and even Bush in the end kind of admitted it later on.When did Bush admit it and how? And what was the true intent? Bush was pretty clear; Remove the regime and install a democracy. What was the *secret* agenda? Let Haliburton make money?"
c9h64ga,joskebangelijk,the whole junior remark doesn't at all make you seem like a condescending twat...
c9h83e8,YouShallKnow,"And misusing the term ""moot point"" makes you look like someone who doesn't have enough life experience to have seen that phrase used in text before. Which leads me to believe you're young. So I'm a dickhead and you're an ignorant child. I'm fine with that. I'm also fine with you abandoning the argument to cry about me calling you names; shows you have nothing left to argue."
c9h0d9o,BoerboelFace,I understand it.
c9gpdj4,Beetle559,Is that any consolation to the families of the dead civilians?Do you really think they shrug off the deaths of their loved ones because they weren't the primary target?Is it any reason the people of the Middle East despise Americans?Do you know how callous and inconsistent your view is?
c9gpoul,jjjaaammm,"I am not offering any commentary other than to say that no, deaths as the result of military actions, justified under the rules of engagement, are not the ""same thing"" as targeting civilians. I don't understand how this is not easy to see, simply as a matter of fact."
c9gpqg4,Beetle559,Would you feel any differently about the victims in Boston if it had been an attack from a government?
c9gpu26,jjjaaammm,"Again, I am not making an emotional argument nor one of moral equivalency. I am simply saying that targeting civilians directly and specifically is not the same thing as them dying in a war zone as the result of a military action. This is a matter of fact."

c9gqngg,traffic_cone_love,"The middle east despises America because they see us as evil due to the fact that we don't follow Islam or Islamic law. They also hate us because we support Israel and they despise Israel. They hate anyone who doesn't follow Islam because they think we're all immoral because we allow and support homosexuality, abortion, etc. So they commit violent acts here and in other parts of the world. The difference is, we fight back."

c9gszq6,,[deleted]
c9j7n41,danratherbe,"You're actually correct - the most vocal (as with any culture) claim it's because of military actions. But if you sit down and actually TALK to people from strict Muslim countries, they will say exactly what you said: they believe we are immoral because of our liberal attitudes, ESPECIALLY homosexuality, because that is a sin punishable by death in their countries. They want Islam to be the ONE religion for the entire world and want to eliminate anyone who doesn't agree. That's why they're willing to kill themselves to make their point."
c9jcc7p,danratherbe,"And when I say ""they"", I do not mean ALL Muslims want to kill, that's not true. I mean the extremists. They have a huge problem with our views on homosexuals and women. They laugh at what they think are ridiculous claims of civil rights violations for not letting ""sexual perverts"" marry in this country because they know in their country, they would be dead."
c9grwnr,YouShallKnow,They also hate us because we have participated in the gang rape the west has committed on the middle east for the last hundred years. We've been fucking them and stealing their wealth for some time; they have good reason to be mad.
c9gu0it,cbarrister,"The INSANE corruption and concentration of wealth in the hands of very few has a large role to play in the middle east as well. Some have very high per capita incomes, but their leaders and governments choose to allow many of their own people to live in abject poverty."

c9gwzln,jblo,"Yeah a 16 year old killed next to his father and other civilians, while being an american citizen was a total mistake."
c9gz8vz,ASOS_addict,"Except the US does specifically target civilians and there is no secret about it (except that you obviously are unaware of this fact). The article is trying to say that US citizens need to have a wider perspective on the world in general. Be sad, be angry, hope that whoever is guilty of the attacks in Boston pays for what they have done, but by that token also hold yourself, your country accountable for the same types of tragedies occurring all over the world. Whoever they are targeted at. It's not about crying over lives lost, it's about taking responsibility for things your government is actively doing. No country or government is ever too powerful to be changed, if the citizens care enough to make a difference. So regardless of who is responsible for the Boston attacks, you as a citizen should feel responsible for the intentional attacks that your government initiates every day, all over the world."
c9gqook,GaijinFoot,"Didn't America block food and medcine to Iraq that resulted in 400,000 childreb dying? Who were they aiming for then? Think their army would starve before the children?"
c9grwb7,mpyne,"Do you really think the Hussein regime had *nothing* to do with children dying for want of food? All America could possibly do was embargo trade, they didn't force Saddam to hoard the food that was there for the Baathists."
c9gss5k,the_goat_boy,Why was medical equipment included in the embargo then?
c9gtl16,,"Because it is painful to the government, but less painful than an invasion, although that is ultimately what we went with."
c9gtn2q,the_goat_boy,You didn't answer the question.Why was medical equipment specifically included in the embargo?
c9gtx7t,,"Because it hurts. And the expected response from a government is, ""You are charged with providing care for your people, if you rely on us for your medical supplies, while investing in the worlds 4th largest military, your priorities need to be changed so we will withhold our medical supplies.""Replace Iraq with North Kore, Hussein with Kim Jong Il. Do you still have a problem with an embargo of supplies into a country that severly over values its funding of its military?"
c9guiwg,Megadoom,"Right, but the whole premise of intervening in Iraq was that Saddam was a dictator who hurt and tortured and gassed his own people. The US response to this, the US response to a psychotic civilian-killing dictator, was to deprive those same civilians of medicine and food on the basis that... Saddam might feel guity and change his tactics to avoid hurting his own people, which is the very thing he'd already shown himself as being happy to do and was the reason for the original intervention!It's really quite dumb."
c9gvaqa,,"Agreed, but remember once we distribut aid to that country, there is no controlling what face is put on it. Do we want saddam going to his people saying look what I have provided for you through my love and good governance. No. Is he capable of creating his own, yes, probably. Although as a global hegemon we are bound to look after the world so to speak, we are not bound to provide for what has the potential to be a functioning society."
c9gvxfq,Megadoom,"*Agreed, but remember once we distribut aid to that country, there is no controlling what face is put on it.*It probably isn't too hard to make clear where and when you are giving aid. They have tv and internet. More to the point though, this wasn't about giving aid. Iraq had plenty of money/oil to buy things itself, it's simply that the US stopped them from doing so.*Do we want saddam going to his people saying look what I have provided for you through my love and good governance. No. Is he capable of creating his own, yes, probably.*Saddam was a dictator. He was a torturer who terrified and murdered his population. Nobody was going to love or be fooled by him whatever he did.The point of sanctions was not to prevent Saddam's people from loving him, it was, somehow, to make his population so sick and hungry that they would - despite their starvation - somehow take up arms and rebel. It was a ludicrous proposal. Starving people steal from and kill each other. They don't form effective armies, particularly not against one as well-armed and large as the Iraqi army.*Although as a global hegemon we are bound to look after the world so to speak, we are not bound to provide for what has the potential to be a functioning society.*No, but when you intervene with a country, and stop it from buying it's own food and medicine, you should take responsibility for the consequences of your actions, including the deaths of its starving children in the face of a dictator who doesn't give a shit."
c9gwob4,,"All well said, but the alternative to that is an invasion. Which we did. Maybe 12 years too late."
c9gwqv7,Megadoom,"Or just leaving them be, particularly when you've got a plane full of Saudis attacking New York city..."
c9gwshn,,"Right, I am addressing your point of aside from an embargo, what other options did the US face in the aftermath of the first Gulf War?No doubt SA is a huge gigantic cluster fuck of a problem"
c9gzksk,Megadoom,"Other options? Well they elected not to do a full invasion and remove Saddam. They therefore elected to keep him in power. Why did they need to do anything at that point? Perhaps restrict weapons sales and impose selective travel embargos and account forfeitures on key individuals. But restrict food and medicine, and somehow hope that starving people will do the job that America was unwilling to? Just seems crazy."
c9gu33m,the_goat_boy,That embargo of medical equipment killed half a million children. Nice job.
c9gvbxz,,"Iraq was not a poor country, he could have spent some fucking time creating his own medicine. If you want the US to be the world police/doctor/teacher, then fine, but we get our share of say in what goes on in your country. If you DON'T want us to do that, then take care of your own fucking people. It's not like Iraq wasn't a functioning society with access to universities, knowledge, medicine etc.,Just another reason why Saddam needed to go. Half a million children of HIS country killed due to lack of their government providing medical care and medicine. How many people total died in the Iraq war that were civilians? Nice Job, Saddam"
c9gvefp,the_goat_boy,"No, those deaths are on you. The US spearheaded an *international* embargo thereby preventing Iraq from receiving medical equipment from other countries. Your government that you elected did this because they wanted regime change. You're culpable. You're a murderer. This is one of many reasons why the world hates you."
c9gvfkh,,"Right, an international embargo, against a despot. I mean seriously, I wish more people could read this and laugh with me. Have you seen Saddams palaces that were built? You could invest in some serious medical/agricultural/social infrastructure with the money he squandered on himself and his friends.Really, your argument is laughable."
c9gvjdd,the_goat_boy,"The embargo wasn't enforced because of his fucking palaces, you idiot. It prevented the importing of medical equipment. What, did you expect Saddam to dismantle his palaces and use building materials to substitute for medical equipment?"
c9gvll3,,"No I would expect him to:1) properly allocate monetary resources gained through his oil trade (Iraq still received money, they were instructed on what to spend it on however)2) Efficiently distribute the aid they did receive3) Invest in social infrastructure rather than lavish palaces in the first place.Really, the northern portion of Iraq/Kurd inhabited regions administered by the UN saw a DECREASE in infant mortality, so really all praise be to us for dropping the mortality rate. The Iraqi government administered areas from Baghdad going south saw an increase in mortality. A sensible person can see who is to blame here."
c9gvnsl,the_goat_boy,"They needed MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. What use is monetary aid if you can't buy medical equipment? That sensible person is me, not you. Only an American would blame someone other than themselves for denying medical equipment to Iraq that killed half a million children."
c9gvv0y,,"International community, and again, the north under UN guidance did just fine, seeing infant mortality rates decline."
c9gtkmy,,"Replace Iraq with North Korea. Do you still have a problem with sanctions of food, oil, and raw material?"
c9grnwu,YouShallKnow,"Sort of, we supported sanctions that restricted *trade* with Iraq. And it wasn't self-sufficient so the population suffered. The point of sanctions is 3 fold. 1) deprive the regime of goods that they can use to sustain their grip on power. 2) create discontent amongst the populace, creating internal pressure against the regime. 3) Do economic damage to the country to further weaken the regime."
c9gp89v,candre23,"> When the choice is made to launch an offensive, which might result in civilian casualties, it is done in the context of achieving a military objectiveThere were probably more than a few soldiers running in the marathon. *If* the bomber were a member of a foreign army and *if* their intent was to kill American soldiers, they could claim that any civilians killed/injured in the blast were merely collateral damage. They'd be on *identical* moral ground as our military is with its drone strikes."
c9gpiz8,njensen,"Yeah, they could *claim* it, but it wouldn't be there intent. There are soldiers everywhere."
c9gpot4,Ice_Pirate,That's very true considering the largest employer in the USA is the DoD. Both points bring up valid concerns and I suppose my opinion might lean another way if I was somehow (in)directly involved.
c9gprwv,jjjaaammm,Perhaps. But those are a lot of ifs. And if they are the case it would not be classified as an act of terrorism. Just as if the attacks were planned by a husband looking to kill his wife for insurance money.
c9gqszi,Giants92hc,"So, in other words, since that is not the case, they are not on identical moral ground."
c9hwes7,homanh,>The U.S. plants pipe bombs filled with nails and ball-bearings at public gatherings to kill and maim civilians for the sole purpose of terrorizing a nation's populous?Yes you were.
c9gqtkc,gocd,"The official term for those civilians is ""bug splat.""We may not be deliberately targeting the civilians in particular, but we're still targeting them."
c9gqzcp,jjjaaammm,"The US is not targeting them. If they were not where the target is, the military would not seek them out. The rules of engagement take in to account collateral damage. If a target can be acquired later with less damage, then he will. The decisions to take action knowing civilians will be killed are not made lightly, nor are they celebrated."
c9gsfpj,gocd,"The US is perfectly aware that they are killing X civilians to get Y militants. It makes the choice that those civilian lives are worth sacrificing. I'm not going to argue so much on the morality, only that their death is deliberate. You can argue justification all you want, thats fine. In the least though, we're going to be producing a lot of ""rage"" in those communities, exactly as the article suggested."
c9gshv8,jjjaaammm,It is not a numbers game. You are suggesting a correlation between killing X number of people and statistically yielding Y number of results. This is not how it works.
c9gt4c8,gocd,"I never said or implied anything about a statistical relationship. If there are multiple civilians in the way of a target, and we decide its worth the civilians lives to eliminate the target, then we are making a deliberate choice to target the civilians, despite them not being the objective. Even if you feel its justified, its still a deliberate action. We can argue semantics if we really want, but what I'm trying to say is simple enough that I'm sure you understand it, even if you disapprove of my wording. And lets say that it is justified, even then, the communities we conduct these operations in are going to feel much differently. And for that reason alone, regardless of your view on these policies, this article has a worthwhile point. I'm comfortable saying that domestically there is a much lower tolerance for civilian deaths caught in crossfires fought by law enforcement. And i think this is natural, people are much more able to humanize their own communities."
c9grlb3,homanh,>I am not the one making a moral equivalency argument here. Yes you are
c9grokj,jjjaaammm,"No I am not, only rejecting his."
c9gtam8,factsdontbotherme,"Does it matter what the motivations are? If your family is killed by the enemy you do not care how ""just"" their cause is. All you care about is revenge. If, instead of a pipe bomb it was a missile that was supposed to hit the mayor of Boston but killed those people instead, would you be OK with it? After all, they were just collateral damage resulting from a ""fair game"" hit. We are mostly soft here so we don't pick up a gun, or a bomb and take the fight directly to them, but they do. That is their way. Hatred has no boundaries, no rules, no sanity. Its evil in physical form and the only way to stop it is to stop creating more of it."
c9gq336,Draffut2012,How did you divine the attackers objective now? There were military personnel running there.
c9gq5gk,jjjaaammm,Seriously?
c9gq9ne,Draffut2012,"Of course. Also, just because the primary goal isn't to instill fear in a populous (If you can somehow divine that also) doesn't mean it isn't a result of the action anyhow."

c9gvxdt,panzerkampfwagen,"Why, because aerial bombing is done by the US and ground attacks by the US's enemies?There is no difference as an act of warfare."
c9h09ti,dblcross121,"No, because one intentionally targets innocent civilians with no other purpose than to terrorize them. The other targets militants but has civilian collateral damage, which is minimized to the greatest extent possible. They cannot be more different.

c9haiub,dblcross121,"Oh gawd. Once again, they are entirely different."
c9hcy97,panzerkampfwagen,No they're not. Double tap bombing is to kill rescuers.
c9gt80n,shock_sphere,"yeah, fewer people died in the Boston marathon bombing than occurs in our missile strikes, which are done for the purposes of acquiring and keeping control of oil."
c9gtalq,dblcross121,Is that why we're in Afghanistan? Hmmm
c9goot8,,"Yeah, it's not like the US government has ever bombed, invaded, destabilized, and placed sanctions on nations, killing scores of civilians. Look how much Iraqis love us! Just look at the wonderful work the US government has done in Chile, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Serbia, Dresden, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki."
c9gp3hg,dontkillgamefish,Have you ever been to any of the countries you listed and actually seen or experienced how the majority of the populace feels about the U.S. and the U.S. governments mission? I personally have been to Iraq as recent as 1 year and half ago and Ill tell you the majority of the citizens supported the mission of the U.S. These citizens were oppressed by a tyrant for years and now enjoy freedom. Is their country still fucked up? Yes there is still problems but they are much better off. You can't just read a CNN article and form your opinion. Works better when you experience it.

c9gpvlk,FuggleyBrew,>If you can't understand the difference between collateral civilian deaths as the result of achieving a military objectiveWhat was the military objective in Chile? Preventing a democracy? We intentionally targeted innocent civilians for torture and murder. It wasn't collateral damage it was an active campaign of terror.

c9gqclz,FuggleyBrew,You claimed that the actions of the US were simply collateral deaths. Many countries were not mere collateral deaths but the intentional targeting of civilians in order to sow terror within the populaces often for poorly defined goals beyond the CIA's inclination towards atrocities and incompetence. It's not simply a question of collateral damage while pursuing a noble goal. Many times it was intentional crimes committed while attempting to pursue nefarious goals.

I understand that there is collateral damage in times of war. But we have gone to war for downright insane reasons that weighs in the balance of the horrors we have subjected innocent people to as a result. When we approach the issue with a disregard for the laws of land warfare that weighs in the balance. When you act with a disregard for civilian casualties (most horrifically in our actions in Vietnam) you cannot call it accidental. Yet even our acts in war has only been a part of the crimes we've committed. The CIA has blackened the United States' name in all but a few rare and fleeting examples. >If anyone has committed a crime on behalf of the US, they should be charged and judged based on the standards of the US as a society.But as a nation we don't support that. Most people actively oppose the idea of prosecuting CIA officials for torture, even fewer care about the horrors the US visited on much of the world."
c9gquqn,jjjaaammm,"That may have more to do with disagreeing with the legal definition of torture, more than the concept of prosecuting it."
c9gr2va,FuggleyBrew,Most of the US practices have established case law determining the US acts to be torture and war crimes. John Yoo's memo was absolutely insane and quite frankly it shouldn't be treated as legal advice but instead as conspiracy.It's simply that much of the American populace doesn't really care so long as it's not them disappearing in the middle of the night.

c9gpw98,jjjaaammm,"Well, your book has no basis in any law. Just because a death can be predicted does not make it murder, as per the definition of murder."

It's all a matter of perspective. In either case, the terrorists believe in their cause. We see it as horrific... well look at the thousands we've managed to 'accidentally' kill in our wars. I mean, we're freaking blowing up Pakistani houses if the inhabitants fit the right age group in signature drone strikes, and we killed far more people when we invaded Iraq. War is hell. We shouldn't try and justify it. We should minimize it as much as we can."

c9hl91x,DavidlikesPeace,"meh now we're just debating petty semantic word choice :/ Obama said ""oh how awful"" after learning one signature strike killed innocent people, because he hoped that signature strikes only hit the target terrorists. He was wrong. The entire system is rotten. You cannot target a demographic group, and expect to only kill the guilty."
c9hoc5g,CUNTBERT_RAPINGTON,We tend to make the distinction between first degree murder and negligent manslaughter
c9gpmpy,jjjaaammm,"The US is not indiscriminately targeting houses based on such data. There still exists rules of engagement. I don't necessarily agree with the US drone tactics, but let's not pretend like the US is strapping on a blindfold and just firing in circles."

c9grk2k,gramie,"So everyone has to follow them? I'm pretty sure you are talking about *Western European* "" traditional international concepts of battlefield conduct"". They sound right to us, because we have grown up accepting them as the natural way things are, but that's not necessarily true."

c9gr303,grievern,"I agree that the U.S. is (most likely) not targeting civilians for the sake of causing civilian deaths (we cannot know for sure what the real objectives are, without all the information). But here's some food for thought - as despicable as violent terrorist acts are, that's the most effective way those terrorists can attack their enemy. The U.S. can afford to be more precise with their targets and choose to attack only military targets, since it has a massive military budget. When you push people, especially those that are technologically less advanced to the point of violence, are they going to attack your military? No. They're going to attack whatever they think will be most effective in attaining their objectives. Sometimes, that happens to be violent acts toward innocent people. Yes, that's horrific, primitive, backwards, and barbaric. But that's the point we've pushed them to. It seems like very few people understand that. No one in this thread is justifying such violent terrorist acts. However, it seems like you are trying to make yourself feel better by repeatedly stating the fact that intentionally killing civilians is 'not the same' as incurring civilian deaths in a war. Lets have a real conversation about it, rather than just dropping in with some tidbit like that, as if that somehow clarifies the entire situation."
c9gryt4,jjjaaammm,This is a different conversation.
c9gp3zf,marinersalbatross,Double tap is double tap. Aiming for rescuers is not cool.
c9gp082,OllieBella,"Just because it's 'not the same thing', it doesn't make it any less malicious and destructive. They're equally horrific."
c9gpepy,jjjaaammm,"Yes, in the case of deaths being deaths, they are equally horrific, but no, motivation does in fact determine maliciousness."
c9gur3z,Megadoom,"I think the problem is that you are conflating intention with desire. Does America 'desire' to kill civilians. No. Does it know, as a consequence of its actions, that civilians will die? Yes, or at least it is a virtual certainty. They therefore intend for civilians to die, as they know that civilian deaths are a direct and unavoidable consequence of their actions.It's like me wanting to steal a diamond behind a glass window. Do I desire to break the glass? No, it will cause noise and probably set off alarms. Do I intend to break it? Absolutely, as it's the only way of getting the diamond, and I am accordingly held accountable for both the damage and the theft.The simple fact that military targets are thrown into the mix when there is a US strike doesn't diminish the connection between my knowledge of the consequences of my attack (i.e. civilian deaths) and my decision to proceed with that attach."
c9gp8mz,samuelbt,Do you differentiate between murder and manslaughter?
c9gqfhx,OllieBella,Yes sir.

c9gpztn,danzig13,"The only goal of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was to inflict massive civilian casualties and scare Japan into surrender. I don't know about Nagasaki, but the only military assets in Hiroshima were on the outskirts of town. The bomb went off in the city center.I know that is going pretty far into the past, but these are probably the largest and most well known (terrorist?) attacks in history."
c9gq4e2,jjjaaammm,"I would be very hesitant to classify them as terrorist attacks, any more than Germany's bombing runs on London were."
c9gq8la,danzig13,Basically all of those bombing campaigns by all sides were terror attacks - systematic use of terror. We just managed to distinguish ourselves with the two largest single acts.
c9gqb0y,jjjaaammm,"I think this is becoming highly semantic, but within the context of two nations involved in conventional declared war, there is a big difference. However, a WWII german soldier would not take out a US civilian parade if given the chance, nor would a US soldier, conversely."

The government at the time even admitted they were intended to be displays of massive force.I'm not sure how I feel about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but it comes close to what I would consider terrorism."
c9gqjcm,jjjaaammm,"They are simply larger scale events within the context of the conventional military tactics of the time, i.e. city center bombings."
c9gqpz5,danzig13,"So large, extremely effective attacks specifically targeting civilians orchestrated by militaries = not terrorism; small, relatively ineffective attacks orchestrated by non-state actors specifically targeting civilians = terrorism."
c9gs452,jjjaaammm,"Somewhat, i mean terrorism has no real definition. It means something different to you than it means to me. But yeah, those large scale military attacks were designed to end the war, not escalate it. They were also not motived with any specific animus toward the targets themselves. And the US provided aid immediately after the surrender. I understand this is largely subjective, but I don't see the motivation behind the bombings of Japan to fit the narrative of terrorism."
c9gxd9f,danzig13,I will agree to disagree. Thanks for staying civil.
c9gra8q,posterdresser,"How exactly is there a difference? If you lost a family member to an errant drone strike, are you seriously telling me that it wouldn't be as bad as if they got hit by a suicide bomber?"
c9gs5f8,jjjaaammm,"No, if I were a victim of such an attack I am sure my perspective would be skewed by the animosity surrounding such an event, fortunately for myself, not being such a victim I have a much clearer head."
c9gs9lk,posterdresser,"I'd argue that you have a weaker perspective than them, being so removed from such violence. You can't tell people how they should feel about something and justify your opinion by saying you have a clearer perspective because it hasn't happened to you."
c9goyi4,,"In Chile, Dresden, Hirshima, and Nicaragua, we aided the deliberate deaths of civilians. In the cases of ""collateral damage,"" the collateral damage was unnecessary because we should not have been in those conflicts in the first place. When you bomb and place sanctions on populated areas, you can't call civilian deaths collateral damage. And when the government aims to kill people who, while being bad characters, are of no interest to the US, collateral damage is unjustified."
c9gql47,Hungry_Lion,We shouldn't have been in Hiroshima in the first place?
c9gpzux,,"You obviously have no idea what you are talking about when it comes to dropping the bombs on Japan. Every man, woman, and child was prepared in propaganda campaigns to eliminate the enemy or to commit suicide. Not only that but Japan would not surrender even when they were beaten before the dropping of the bombs. It was not just the government that wouldn't give up but EVERYONE in the country. It is argued that the dropping of the bombs actually prevented deaths on a larger scale in both American and Japanese troops. In order to really understand the motives and why it happened you really need to look into Japanese cultural mentality as well as the historical climate at the time. Yes, it was a horrible thing that had to be done. However, it was very necessary."
c9gqexr,mcivor_1,"What about the use of agent orange in Vietnam? Where not only close to half a million people were killed but also half a million children born with defects directly linked to this chemical. Did this ""prevent more deaths on a larger scale""? America always have an answer to their wrong doings and try to justify it so it will be interesting to see what anyone has to say."
c9gzryp,,I have no defense for the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam. That was fucked up.
c9ham93,mcivor_1,"So you have completely under minded the argument of ""colaterall damage"" then? When you attack/invade a country that you have no right being in and get spanked by the natives its time to leave. Nope not for America they just use really nasty shit that is inhumane to bring a country to its knees and show zero remorse by continuing with the same foreign policy for the next 40 years. That is why so many people have no sympathy for America, they have such a sketchy recent history but it just keeps repeating. I've seen so many comments about the average American can't do anything about Foreign policy well that is complete and utter BS because the government is accountable to the people who put them there and only them. Act as a group and not individuals, create a new political party and take the Democrats and Republicans down and run the country how the majority want it to be run not the Bureaucracy that is doing so at the minute."
c9gpk7b,jjjaaammm,"A bit of a change of subject, but deliberateness and justification are two different issues. Regardless, those actions were executed in the context of a military objective, not under the sole motivation for inflicting harm for the sake of inflicting harm.

c9grcwk,,1) Cite your sources when you claim this number has been disputed.2) Of course it has been disputed! Every number in every war has been disputed.
c9gxmmn,SuperGeometric,"From Wikipedia: >A dossier released by Iraq Body Count, a project of the U.K. non-governmental non-violent and disarmament organization Oxford Research Group, attributed approximately 6,616 civilian deaths to the actions of U.S.-led forces during the ""invasion phase"", including the shock-and-awe bombing campaign on Baghdad.[18]These findings were disputed by both the U.S. military and the Iraqi government.So here are a couple of problems:1) Your source is extremely biased, and they have an agenda.2) The numbers, even if true (and they're almost certainly *not* true) are for the whole ""invasion"" portion, not the Shock and Awe bombings (which is what I asked for.)Once again, please cite a (good, unbiased) source that thousands of civilians were killed during **""shock and awe""**. A disputed number from a biased source detailing casualties during the entire first three weeks of the conflict is not sufficient."
c9gppkq,Angus_O,. . . There are hundreds of thousands of Iraqi dead . . .
c9gpqvo,SuperGeometric,"Yes we clearly targeted and killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqis during ""shock and awe"" good call."
c9gpty0,Angus_O,"I don't appreciate the sarcasm. I think it was relatively clear that I was merely outlining the fact that American intervention in Iraq resulted in the death of more than 100 thousand people and the displacement of an estimated 1,000,000. Do you reply with such hostility to everyone who tried to engage in discussion with you?"
c9gpwom,SuperGeometric,"When they're trying to shift the conversation and skew perceptions, yes I do. Somebody made the claim that shock and awe was terrorism aimed at civilians. It wasn't. Bringing large numbers of deaths into the discussion without clearly separating it from what we're discussing does nothing but spread misinformation."
c9gq2tt,Angus_O,"I apologize if you were discussing the specific tactical value of shock and awe, but to me it appeared as though ""shock and awe"" was being used as shorthand for the early phase of the invasion. In the second sense, it would be responsible for setting off the powder keg in Iraq that resulted in the numbers I've cited above. If your discussion was in consideration of the first sense, than I suppose the argument could be made that had shock and awe not been employed than another tactical approach would have been taken, with similar results. If you were discussing this only in terms if tactics, though, I don't see the wider relevance to the situation at hand."
c9gq46r,SuperGeometric,"I was discussing whether the shock and awe bombing campaign was terrorism directed at civilians or not. It clearly wasn't. Not to be crude, but if our intent was to kill as many civilians as we could, Iraq would essentially be a glass parking lot right now. We didn't attack civilians with shock and awe. We attacked the military."
c9gojck,No-one-cares,"Killing innocents isn't event killing anymore, it's collateral damage,"
c9go9z1,jjjaaammm,"Yeah, no. When you volunteer a tagline the whole thing kinda has to be in quotes. The U.S. does not intentionally target civilians or even consider the possibility of collateral damage in the absence of achieving a military objective, i.e. the engagement of actual operational targets. No matter how warped your world view is, it is simply inaccurate and flat out false to say that what happened in boston is ""exactly the kinds of attacks that the US has been bringing to the Muslim world.""

c9gs07z,YouShallKnow,"They don't conduct drone strikes in crowded cities where random passers by and police would respond. They attack targets in the sparely populated regions terrorists operate in. So when a target is struck, there's probably not an ambulance or police officer within a hundred miles; the only people to help, are those traveling with the target, i.e. other militants."

Just explain yourself please (or stop ""participating"" in these kinds of discussions)."
c9gsn7a,TheBananaKing,"The point is that the extreme percentage of civillian casualties does rather stunningly refute your assertion that strikes are targeted at areas free of civilians, and that rescuers killed in double-tap strikes are not civilians either."
c9gu42k,YouShallKnow,"1) there is no ""extreme percentage"" of civilian casualties by drones; the anti-drone advocacy group, living under drones, puts that number around 1/3 which beats the hell out of traditional tactics in traditional conflicts. So drones actually have an extremely low level of civilian causalities when compared to regular warfare tactics. 2) I didn't say that drone strikes are only conducted in areas free of civilians. I explained how a ""double tap"" drone strike could feasibly be used to destroy exclusively military targets. Your proposition that the technique alone was proof of our intent to target civilians, since the technique targets rescuers who are presumably civilian. I pointed out that if the rescuers are the target's militant traveling party, than a double tap would be effective at destroying a military target and thus isn't evidence, in and of itself, that we're targeting civilians. 3) How many incidents of the double tap drone strikes have occurred? Where have they been conducted? How many civilians are alleged to have died versus militants? If you have this info and a source, I would love to explore the possibility of your argument. But I don't think you have any of that data, I think you just have the existence of the technique. Which, as I pointed out above, isn't evidence we target civilians as you seem to think it is."

c9gs2qd,YouShallKnow,"You're asking what's the motivation of our foreign policy? Well, if you understand basic civics you know our foreign policy is ran by whoever won the last election, so each act may have a different intent. Obama's drone campaign is designed to destroy Al Qaeda and similar groups. Bush's invasion of Iraq was ostensibly to conduct regime change and turn Iraq into a democracy."
c9gqvb8,jjjaaammm,"Dude, I can't do your thinking for you."
c9h0tyn,BoerboelFace,But... who *will*?
c9gwnxm,caferrell,"The motivations behind the US actions are to keep power, influence and money flowing into Military Industrial Complex. There are no higher motivations. The rest is propaganda and you seem to have bought into all the lies."
c9gp9u8,,[deleted]
c9gpq0x,jjjaaammm,"Okay, we agree, but that is not what I am arguing."
c9gq5ub,,"No, exactly the same motivation, which is to achieve some political end. The US has to feign concern for civilians because otherwise the population wouldn't tolerate it. You have to make Americans always believe they are the good guys. Looking at actual civilian death tolls in places like Iraq and Afghanistan or Yemen and Pakistan, it is clear that civilian safety isn't too pressing a matter for the US."
c9govji,Gpr1me,What about Hiroshima and Nagasaki? They dropped bombs in the middle of the city
c9gp6mq,jjjaaammm,"This is not the equivalency that the author of the article was making.However, though much more questionable, it is still within the context of a military objective. Conventional war was declared on the US and through the lens of a cost/benefit analysis, those attacks were very much meant to achieve a military objective. The fact that the US rebuilt Japan and aided in the rehabilitation of those affected by the bombing, shows that despite being devastating, the motivation was not specifically to inflict harm on the populous for the sake of inflicting harm."
c9gp9yx,Gpr1me,I don't get how it's different. The attacks on US are strategic too. Nobody kills for the sake of killing.
c9gpp70,njensen,"Yeah, yeah they do."
c9gpnks,EUPRAXIA1,Actually both cities were major military targets. Tens of thousands of military deaths were caused at one of the targets (no source since I heard that tidbit from a television show with Gary Sinise) and we dropped 63 million leaflets in Japan warning civilians to leave areas ahead of time.
c9golak,VanCardboardbox,">No matter how warped your world view is, it is simply inaccurate and flat out false to say that what happened in boston is ""exactly the kinds of attacks that the US has been bringing to the Muslim world."" That is just flat out false.This one goes to you, jjjaaammm, as you are technically correct. Not ""exactly the kind"".That the US has been content to accept civilian casualties to peruse its military objectives in Iraq and Afghanistan, however, is manifest in the history of the last ten years. Futhermore, the whole notion of a ""shock and awe"" fire storm that subdues and breaks the spirit of a whole population is unquestionably the mechanics of terrorism."
c9goui4,jjjaaammm,"Again, ""Shock and Awe"" is a military objective designed to dishearten those who would take up arms against the US, not those who simply want to watch their father cross the finish line of a marathon."
c9gr5ri,VanCardboardbox,"Agreed, sort of. I was not alleging equivalency here. Just expressing some understanding of those who would hope that some Americans take a moment to think about actions their country takes that inflict terror on local populations in the light of this fresh tragedy. >""Shock and Awe"" is a military objective designed to dishearten those who would take up arms against the USMaybe just the wording, but S&A is not an objective, but a tactic. The objective is to break the will of the enemy."
c9gr6yi,jjjaaammm,"Yes, but my point is that the population at large is not seen as the enemy, nor was shock and awe devised for their benefit."
c9grbj3,VanCardboardbox,">Yes, but my point is that the population at large is not seen as the enemy, nor was shock and awe devised for their benefit.We will have to disagree on this. I am of the opinion that the heavy bombing of Baghdad in 2003 that introduced us to the term ""Shock and Awe"" was indeed intended to terrify not just those in arms, but the whole of the population. Make them understand that they should not support a war effort that would invite fire and death to rain down on them and to reject the leadership that brought them to it."
c9gq2au,,"Yes, but those ""military objectives"" can be whatever they want. They can and often do make up very weak justification when slaughtering dozens or even hundreds of people. It is a trivial distinction. Like if Al Qaeda claimed that the twin towers were a military target because they were the financial hub driving the enemy's weapons production, would 9/11 suddenly be justified because there was a ""military objective"" behind it? And the US not targeting civilians only holds for direct military action in the last couple of decades, not covert action and certainly not for the Vietnam War."
c9gp2pv,,"Except for when our soldiers shoot and kill civilians for ""sport"". I respect our military greatly, but I think it's worth mentioning that we've terrorized the Iraqis in the past with as much malice as the Boston attack."
c9gpbg2,jjjaaammm,"This is true, however, they are acting outside of their mandate, and we as a society persecute those who engage in those acts. They are isolated and not a result of policy. A US soldier shooting Iraqi children who are juggling a soccer ball outside of a school, would be the moral equivalency of what happened here, however that is not the argument the author is making, nor is it the one I am responding to."
c9gpwty,LibertyrDeath,"Yeah, no...To the extent that the US military purposefully engages a target using an explosive payload, with a known effective kill radius, whilst there are innocents within said zone, then the US is knowingly targeting civilians."
c9gq2ct,jjjaaammm,"Your understanding of the word ""targeting"" needs work."

c9gr50e,LibertyrDeath,"There is no operative difference between being targeted directly and being targeted by association, especially when the end result is your dead children."
c9gra10,jjjaaammm,"Targeted by association is not what you are describing. They were not targeted at all in any capacity, the existence of the family has no bearing on the hypothetical attack.The news report would read something like, ""Police believe the children were not the target of the attack, but were unfortunately in the wrong place at the wrong time."""
c9grvpd,LibertyrDeath,"Your arguement requires that there was zero knoweledge of the hypothetical families proximity to the primary target. Only then can it be said that they were ""in the wrong place at the wrong time."". ""Targeting"" implies intent.When I make the concious decision to end the lives of the hypothetical family members, I have intentionally targeted them, along with the primary target.There is no difference in the cockpit. If a pilot observes that there are non targets in the killzone, and knowingly ends their lives...then it was his intent to kill them, which is to say, that he intentionally targeted them."
c9grvyh,Framnk,"Sorry but 'US has bigger bombs so it can kill more people' is very flawed. I don't condone everything the military is doing, but the US military has spent a lot of money developing smarter weapons, bombs, what-have-you specifically designed to reduce civilian casualties. If not, why would we not just drop a nuke? It's not about bigger bombs. Say what you will, that just doesn't seem to be a priority with most other militaries in the world."
c9gx7xy,scobes,"Remember, most of reddit is too young to remember Shock and Awe."

c9gp3dm,SpudgeBoy,When was it we declared war on Pakistan?
c9gra98,Honztastic,"Have we been bombing Pakistan? No.And since basically all of the Western world, read that *legitimate democratic governments* supported the raid and that Pakistan itself was sheltering known terrorists that killed innocent civilians and has no moral authority to wield on the subject, I'll call it perfectly acceptable."
c9gswpx,SpudgeBoy,You can't be serious. Everybody on the planet knows about these actions.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_attacks_in_Pakistan>The United States government has made hundreds of attacks on targets in northwest Pakistan since 2004 using drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency's Special Activities Division.[3]
c9gtpyr,Honztastic,"Aw, well my mistake. I thought much of these drone attacks were in the more remote parts of Afghanistan. So my mistake.As I understand it though, the areas along the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan are just tribal zones. Basically small villages that are too far away from any effective governmental presence to actually be considered part of those countries. And they are the prime hiding ground for insurgent forces using jurisdictions and borders to try and hide.I have no qualms or protests to crossing that border to get those assholes.That being said, I am *highly* against the drone program to circumvent and type of jurisprudence in what amounts to assassination. There is a difference in pursuing an armed cadre across a so-called ""border"" to bombing a family's house to get one guy."
c9gu953,SpudgeBoy,"Now that I can agree with. If we are talking about armed fot soldiers chasing down a group of these guys and they cross some remote border into another country to ""Git 'cross the county line,"" I don't have any problems with following them and capturing/killing them. I also don't mind a well orchestrated middle of the night raid to take out an encampment, such as the OBL operation.I have a problem with us patrolling the skies of a country that hasn't given us permission to do that. I don't have a problem with drones, if they are used as we would a military jet fighter. Flying a drone into another countries air space is no different than flying an F-18 into the same air space."
c9gubfi,Honztastic,"Yeah, I was under the impression that these asshole insurgents have their camps just over the border in Pakistan, sneak into Afghanistan and set up bombs or suicide attacks or ambushes and then hightail it back across the border.That could be wildly off base."

c9gtnq2,Honztastic,"While true, there is a categorical and clear distinction between the two objectively.A lot of crazy idiots think the Taliban are freedom fighters.

No the US military's sole purpose is not to instill terror in the populous, but they do and I guarantee you that the people in these countries live in far more fear than the people in America do. Is killing thousands by accident really better than killing three intentionally? Do Americans really convince themselves of that? The road to hell is paved with good intentions. You can tell yourself that its ok because we didnt mean to make them scared and we didnt mean to kill them, but we still did, and their family members are still dead. Good luck convincing them that the guy in Nevada with an xbox controller had the very best of intentions when he dropped a hellfire missile on the hospital where their family member worked, or was being treated. Intentional or no these are the very sort of horrific, civilian slaughtering attacks that the US has been bringing to the Muslim world, only much, much worse."

But implying that westerners don't feel sad about the loss of life in Iraq or Afghanistan is frankly outdated.

I spent the day in work (well, my lunch hour) having to listen to the drivel Sky ""News"" were spouting, and there was barely a mention of the bombs in Iraq or the earthquake in Iran.

How does anyone become that evil?"".I have such sympathy for everyone in Iraq affected by the bombs and constant threat of violence and death, and similarly I have sympathy for the people in Boston affected by yesterdays bombs."
c9gndbx,shady8x,">""Idea of secondary bombs designed to kill the first responders is just sick.

They don't always do it, but [they do in fact do it](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/outrage-at-cias-deadly-double-tap-drone-attacks-8174771.html). That [leaked video from a while back with a chopper killing some reporters and other civilians after assuming that they are insurgents and seemingly mistaking a camera for an rpg, shows one such incident.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=5rXPrfnU3G0#!&t=9m0s) Whoever makes the statement you quoted(and I have heard it spoken several times) is sponsoring that kind of evil(and obviously I do agree that it is evil) every time they vote for warmongers or don't vote against them. This kind of evil is our tax dollars at work.It is horrible that something like this happened right here in America, but people shouldn't pretend that it is only those others, those not like us that are capable of such things.

Both are choosing to carry out acts of aggression that they know beforehand will kill civilians but justify it as being worthwhile to attain som political end.Imagine if Russia flew a predator drone over Boston and blew up a whole apartment building full of people and then claimed afterwords it thought their might have been someone it deemed an enemy of Russia in the building.

The Taliban are killing civilians in Afghanistan and Pakistan (Malala Yousafi, Benazhir Bhutto being two examples that received media coverage), but the US is wildly unpopular in Pakistan so expanding a ground war into Pakistan would upset the very delicate alliance we have with the central Pakistani government.The entire counterinsurgency strategy hinges on the US not killing innocent people. The gains from killing someone in a drone strike have to outweigh the possible losses in public opinion. Therefore the US has every incentive to avoid civilian casualties.I encourage you to read up on the ISAF official policies if you are interested in the region.http://www.isaf.nato.int/mission.html"

c9h2ar3,MyPimpFriend,"And beyond that, The operator who accidentally bombed a Pakistani wedding went to military prison. So did that soldier who went off the deep end and murdered a bunch of people in a village in Afghanistan. So did the people taking ""war trophies"". Your view of this stems from straight ignorance about how the military operates."
c9gw5j0,Nightfall_589,"Yet, should the perps turn out to be Islamists, the government will doubtlessly be using this exact bombing attack to justify...More drone strikes.Does this seem asymmetrical to you?"
c9h5bes,,"No, it won't. If it's someone from Afghanistan or Pakistan (very doubtful) it's possible this would lead to an increase in drone strikes, but if it's a guy living in the US, it'll just lead to more surveillance by law enforcement of Muslim communities, and if it's a white guy, it will lead to more criticism of video games.Was there an increase in drone strikes after Maj. Hasan killed 13 soldiers in a clinic? Nope."
c9gqhms,,"First of all, the estimates on the numbers killed in drone strikes vary widely because the program is largely covert. The Pakistani government claims that over 800 have been killed in Pakistan alone in the last year. Second, the Obama administration policy is to claim that anybody killed in a drone strike is an enemy combatant unless proven otherwise. So in Pakistan in the last two year some 3,500 people were killed. The US claims that all but a few hundred were terrorists, even though they can only confirm that they have killed dozens of known terrorists. So thousands are being counted as non-civilians simply because no proof has been given that they weren't terrorists.Second, under international law established during the Nuremberg Trials, if you invade a country, you are responsible for all the death and carnage you unleash. So *maybe* 80% of deaths in Afghanistan are caused by the insurgency, but there would be no insurgency, and in fact no Taliban, if it weren't for the US. The US, by its own standars, is responsible for all civilian death in Afghanistan. Maybe this sounds outlandish to you, but if say the Chinese invaded the US, wouldn't we consider Americans killed by American resistance fighters as being the moral responsibility of the Chinese?"
c9gqofr,,"The invasion is over, and has been over for, what, 12 years now? The Taliban are a fringe movement that polls below 20% in support from both Afghanistan and Pakistan.The current situation is more like Mexico invading Texas with the support of the Chinese, and the media blaming the Chinese for everything when it is the Mexican and Mexican supported Texan government doing most of the dirty work.You can't transpose the war in Afghanistan into a larger scale hypothetical conflict because all the variables are much different."
c9gozmp,GreyMASTA,still 350 too many. What the fuck are you trying to tone down?
c9gpdgd,samuelbt,"Well generally in war, countries kill people. The vast and overwhelming majority of those in drone deaths are militants.http://counterterrorism.newamerica.net/drones"

That's a huge distinction. The problem is that terrorists live among civilians. If we could kill them without killing innocents, we absolutely would. Terrorists, on the other hand, *intentionally kill civilians*. This guy wasn't aiming for a military target or a government target. He put bombs filled with shrapnel in a crowd of people.

That alone is enough for me to discount anything you have to say.No, an Obama administration official said 400 last year in Pakistan alone. Furthermore, look at the number of ""combatants"" they kill. There are several thousand in Pakistan alone, yet how many of these are ""confirmed combatants"" vs ""unknown combatants""? An ""unknown combatant"" is somebody the administration classifies as a combatant because he/she was killed an an area they thought combatants might be and they don't know who they were. In other words, if you are killed by a drone you are a combatant until proven otherwise. And furthermore, the program is covert, we only get a fraction of the figures and in many rural areas, they don't even bother to do accurate counts. A 1000 civilians a year is a very conservative estimate.> No, it's not. That's a huge distinction. The problem is that terrorists live among civilians.

He put bombs filled with shrapnel in a crowd of people. There's a huge fucking difference.It is only a ""huge fucking distinction"" if you believe the US has the right to arbitrarily decide who is a ""terrorist"" and then decide its okay to kill some civilians in pursuit of said ""terrorist"". Like if the Boston bomber claimed somebody at the finish line was a ""terrorist"" target in their estimation and they would have preferred not to hurt anybody else but they had to bomb the ""terrorist"" in the crowd, would that change the situation at all? Of course not, it would still be a horrendous and unjustifiable act. I agree there is a distinction between directly targeting civilians and targeting areas where you know civilians will die but not caring too much. For the victims, however, the distinction is minimal. So if someone in Yemen has their family killed because the US has some shoddy intelligence about a guy down the street and figured they'd act on it, it feels the same as directly targeting them. > How many times have we blown up a ""whole apartment building full of people""? If our total casualty count is around 300 over 3 years, it can't be very often, now can it?We killed 400 in a single strike http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2013/03/20/news/national/400-civilians-killed-by-us-drones-in-pakistan/, that could be an apartment building.I actually am following the evidence, you want to believe the mythology about the ""Land of the Free, Home of the Brave"", so you try to rationalize and justify whatever the US does as legitimate. The US government isn't a noble entity, it follows principles of Realpolitik just as any other state."

c9go9qq,lawanddisorder,"The U.S. does not kill ""thousands of civilians every year"" with its drone strikes. The New America Foundation--[a nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy institute](http://newamerica.net/about) has been tracking U.S. drone strikes since 2004. Their high for total civilian casualties in Pakistan since 2004 is [307](http://counterterrorism.newamerica.net/drones). You can view their methodology [here](http://counterterrorism.newamerica.net/drones/methodology).In any event, international humanitarian law and the [Rome Statute] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Statute) permit belligerents to carry out proportionate attacks against military objectives, even when it is known that some civilian deaths or injuries will occur. A crime occurs if there is an intentional attack directed against civilians (principle of distinction) (Article 8(2)(b)(i)) or an attack is launched on a military objective in the knowledge that the incidental civilian injuries would be clearly excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage (principle of proportionality) (Article 8(2)(b)(iv).There is no evidence to suggest that the U.S. has either intentionally directed attacks with drones at civilians outside of military objectives or that any particular drone attack was excessive.Your hypothetical of Russia using a drone to blow up an apartment building is nothing like the U.S. drone strikes in that the apartment strike you describe would be both an attack on a non-military objective and would result in clearly excessive casualties.Sorry to disturb you and Greenwald with facts and law but sometimes those things are important."

c9gpp2h,veiron,"Damn, if only 307 people died in Boston, everything would have been alright. I hear that is the OK-number nowadays."
c9gopxh,jjjaaammm,"Yes, the US kills civilians. That is a fact. However, the US does not view civilians as a target, nor do US military actions exist for the purpose of killing civilians. We can debate if the methods the US military uses are heavy handed or even necessary, however, what is not up for debate is the fact that US military actions do not exist for the sole purpose of taking out civilians, nor would they even consider taking action that results in civilian deaths outside of the context of targeting a military asset."
c9grhtt,cumbert_cumbert,It is interesting to note that in the majority a terrorist often is a civilian. An armed combatant. They don't belong to an army nor have been enlisted as such. The US is fighting a loosely organised group of civilians.
c9grnze,jjjaaammm,"True, but they for the most part are either members of an ad hoc government, i.e. the Taliban, or swear an allegiance to an organization, i.e. al Qaeda. We are essentially fighting civilians though, you are right. They have the ability to seamlessly blend in with the populous and have chosen actions which make them legitimate military targets. It is not exactly fair, however, to consider this a two way street when the coin is flipped. Unfortunately in this case a regulated army vs. a guerrilla force has historically not ended well for the regulated army."
c9gpmy4,Beetle559,When the US launches a missile knowing it will kill a civilian that does not magically make it okay because civilians are not the primary target.

c9gq4nu,Beetle559,"So then let me ask you, from the point of view of the victims of US missiles does the motive matter?"
c9gq8jr,jjjaaammm,No. But to a newspaper editorialist in should.
c9gqiwe,Beetle559,That makes no sense whatsoever. He wrote an opinion piece that empathizes with innocent civilians killed by American missiles.Are you saying the only *valid* people to empathize with are USG officials?
c9gqn63,jjjaaammm,"It makes a lot of sense. He should be removed from the emotion of being stuck by a missile. I don't expect a person living in a tribal hut in Pakistan to care why his house was blown up, only that it was and by whom. However, someone whose job it is to actually look at events through the lens of logic and reason, should be able to see the difference between an errant missile, or a precise one with collateral damage, and blowing up innocent people with backpack bombs who came out to watch a race, with absolutely zero military context what-so-ever."
c9go23o,Cosmo-Cato,"Another false equivalence. We have the approval of the Pakistani government to carry out the bombing because the people we're targeting are enemies of both the Pakistanis and the US (and Russia and literally the entire world).

This is a rhetorical question of course. The groups being targeted are proportionaly small when compared to the rest of the inhabitants of the country in which they reside. My point being, that a single group of radicals cannot speak for an entire nation and, as such, it is imoral to bring war to an entire populace, in retaliation for the actions of some tiny fringe element of their society.Also, and this is important- the US and its allies have been agressing against countries in the middle east for more than 50 years. Assassinations, Coup d'etat, monetary and military support etc. Hence, anything done by these so called terrorists, is done in retaliation towards an agressive foreign invader. ""some of them want to establish a new caliphate, and impose Islamic law on everyone. ""Sure, ""some"" of them want that. Again, not my problem, nor does it justify the cost of human life and wealth. ""If they won't make peace then there is no alternative but to fight.""False dichotomy. There is always another alternative. The US needs to leave the middle east to...middle easterners."
c9gppxb,veiron,So why did you give them power in the 80's?
c9gogic,,"If Russia had the permission of the US govt to do so like we have to have with the countries we operate our drones in, than it could claim the right to do it. But than again the reason we operate the drones to begin with in countries such as Yemen, Pakistan, etc is because they the state apparatus is to weak to deal with enemies of the U.S in their home countries and we need to find ways of combatting them. You criticize the use of drones but the other option would be to directly send US soldiers to these countries and declare war on their host govts. Its just not feasible."
c9gqrpe,pseudotensor,"Good, I'm glad you injected the concept of ""feasibility"" into the moral arguments.

c9gy1yr,,"Their is nothing moral in foreign policy and it has never been that way. Nations have the primary responsiblity in foreign policy to make sure it protects U.S citizens. The people who are targeted in drone strikes are those who have bad intentions. These are people who either plan terror attacks in the region or on U.S soil or working to dismantle the govt of the countries they operate in. They even pose a threat to Pakistans nuclear arsenal and if they got their hands on them ( which btw Pakistans military installations aren't as well protected as you may think) than it would cause major intl's tensions between India/Pakistan/China. These are very real threats. BTW, I am fully supportive of the calls for President Obama to release the legal rationale for using drones as I think legal parameters do need to be put in place on U.S Citizen targets."

Although, there wasn't a Quran school going on at the time, it's still a cover up of US special forces killing children in a mosque. But the mishap might be due to the long time since I had read the article.The quote I'm talking about:> Later that month, the Task Force launched am operation to kill or capture senior al Qaeda figure Abu Laith al-Libi in Paktika province, close to the border with Afghanistan. They failed to find Libi, who was killed several months later. During the operation, a missile attack was launched on a mosque compound where several suspects were thought to be, but the action resulted in the deaths of 7 children. The follow-up report said “An elder who was at the Mosque stated that the children were held against their will and were intentionally kept inside.”When you were in action, yes, you were bound by rules, although there is plenty of evidence of US soldiers abusing their power and terrorizing Iraqi citizens out of anger, spite, or hatred. But there are plenty of secretive CIA operations that get muffled away and kept silent."

And, with all the 'good intents' the US has world wide, they sure are raking up a nice body count along the way. [This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War) article gives numbers anywhere between a 1:2 ratio (two combatants per civilian loss) to 10:1 (although I highly doubt the 10:1 myself). The most believable of the numbers to me is the Iraq Body count Project which states 110,937–121,227 civilian deaths from violence. 172,907 civilian and combatant deaths. Being more of a 2:3 ratio. This means your country was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of 110-120 thousand civilians, but hey, it was all with good intentions. In fact, your country even demands that we are grateful and give you all a good ol' pat on the back for being so brave and all.Not to mention that I'm pretty damn sure that there were at least some incidents of deliberate terrorism from US soldiers towards Iraqi civilians.

Add 40,000 combatants and civilians in Cambodia (note, some of those were combatans) and you still barely get to 110,000> [Turkish Invasion of Cyprus] a couple thousand civilians (1974)I mean, I could keep going down [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_1945%E2%80%931989) list and name all the wars and occupations that had less than 100,000 civilian casualties, and I'd be busy for a while, but I guess you get my point."
c9h8z5f,AFunnyThing-,"Because you're shifting definitions to meet your own opinion. Terrorism is a direct attack on non-military infrastructure by a non-military fighting force with the intent of causing harm to civilians and make mayhem in order to further a political agenda vice operations to attack a direct target in order to obtain information or halt future harm with the possibilities of civilian casualties.Then you continue as if the United States would support or should be directly responsible for the actions of a number of people acting outside of policy and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The only instance you can really find for one of your claims is some Special Warfare unit that may or may not exist (I'm technically part of the Navy ""Special Warfare"" community. Navy EOD) or a few instances where it's a firefight. There've one instance of some Marines being assholes and shooting up a mosque highrise but even then they were heavily reprimanded and punished for such actions."
c9h9qsw,Brightt,I brought up an article where it gives personal accounts of US soldiers that were peer pressured by their senior officers into bullying and abusing Iraqi soldiers. I don't see how that's an isolated Special Warfare unit.

c9hh4nb,AFunnyThing-,What is the official stance of the United States of America on International Law and the treatment of civilians versus the stance of a terrorist?Compare and Contrast.
c9hoa22,Brightt,"> the official stance of the United States of America on International Law and the treatment of civilians I dunno, on paper, or in reality? Because Guantanamo Bay had civilians in them. Obama approved of the [NDAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act_for_Fiscal_Year_2012) which essentially strips you of any right to trial if they think you're a terrorist. Also, the fact that drone strikes continue to kill civilians on a daily basis on Pakistan also keeps me wondering.The US might say that they respect civilians, but in reality, they don't give a shit, and if you don't see that, I feel sorry for your misplaced loyalty in a government that doesn't even respect your rights as a citizen."
c9hs5b3,AFunnyThing-,"I don't support everything my government does, but I do support my country. Don't make this into some pissing contest of America's weaknesses versus her strengths. Certainly all of the global aid, routing out of terrorist cells, enforcement of international treaties on the high seas, and the like attest to the fact that the United States' goal is not to just kill masses of civilians.The ADA authorized the killing of civilians, yes, but it's not like they are targeting masses of civilians for just being there but single non-military terrorists who have participated in global terrorism operations.Once again, beautifully preformed research and critical thinking on your part. You obviously know how laws are applied in the warfront and internationally. Congratulations.Navy EOD by the way. Playing counterterrorism is my game when deployed."
c9gx9p2,Illorion,"Ive seen a couple pull through a checkpoint in Afghanistan with kids in the car...drive slightly past the gate then jump out the car, run and set off the bombs...kids still in the car. These fucks are the kind of people who intentionally keep women and children close by their operations and in the dark about what's going for the explicit purpose of using their deaths as propaganda should they be discovered. The US doesn't care about middle eastern women and children? Well they care even less than we do...they only pretend so they can cry foul"

They are not solely blaming America for what has happened, because other countries have been involved but understand the perspective."
c9gratk,religated,I think you are misconstruing the American response. We are upset because the article suggests that we are indiscriminately killing guilty and innocent alike abroad. That is not not the case. PS telling a victim of rape to not worry about it because other people get gang raped is classless and completely insensitive.
c9grrga,Osiriskiller,They didn't say don't worry about it they said that you rape other people and don't feel bad about it.
c9guwte,religated,"To paraphrase the article: Whatever pain you are going through as an American, you inflict the same pain on other people, so —while grieving— think on your sins. There is no offer of condolences by the author, just the suggestion that the American reader is at fault.

We are killing innocents overseas and we're supposed to just shrug it off and say ""eh, collateral damage.""I cannot believe how many people I saw automatically blame Muslims for yesterday's attack. We've been conditioned by the government to blame a specific group for anything bad that happens. It's kind of funny though, because the Taliban released a statement saying that even though they'd kill any American they found, they weren't responsible for the bombings."

c9hb24p,mpyne,"The law normally accounts for intent in other types of killings, why would it be different here? Premediated murder is different from murder is different from manslaughter is different from vehicular homicide is different from killing in self-defense."

c9hbt2h,mpyne,"On the other hand, there's no penalty for breaking morality but the possibility of a bruised conscience. Though that might be bad enough; I know I'd feel horrible if I pulled the remote trigger on what ended up being a wedding instead of a meeting of the top terrorist lieutenants."

c9go1hb,Phantai,"As tragic and as absolutely devastating the Boston attack was, America has racked up a much, much, MUCH bigger body count of innocents. This one incident doesn't even come close to the body count of recent drone attacks. Even worse, the drone attacks are statistically negligible compared to some of the atrocities America has committed in the last 70 years.Starting with the fact that the United States is the only country in the history of the world to have actually used atomic weapons on people, they killed **250,000** innocent Japanese citizens in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Entire cities were destroyed. Homes turned to dust. Those unlucky enough to have survived lived in agony for the remainder of their short lives. Radiation poisoning and blindness plagued many many thousands. Ignoring the questionable involvement of America in the Korean war (since many of the atrocities were committed by the Koreans themselves), the next laundry list of atrocities comes from the Vietnam war. The My Lai massacre resulted in the death of **500**~ innocent people, many of whom were women and children. Agent Orange destroyed MILLIONS of acres of vegetation, and poisoned local food and water supplies, resulting in **300**+ deaths and deformations (this is much harder to quantify accurately). **400,000** innocent civilians were killed by napalm bombs that Americans dropped on farms, and non-militant villages. Many of these people were also women and children; fire doesn't discriminate. Then we have Operation Condor, which resulted in **50,000**+ civilian deaths and **30,000** missing (with even more detained without habeas corpus) civilians in Latin America, all for the purposes of propagating American idealism (without the support of the American citizens). The bombing of Yugoslavia resulted in as many as **5,000** civilian deaths.The Gulf War saw **100,000** civilian deaths, the War in Afghanistan saw more than **12,000** (although the statistics are very incomplete), and the Iraq War saw more than than **100,000**.Not counting the dozens of proxy wars which America initiated or supported, the death toll of innocents as a direct result of America attempting to impose its values onto the world (eerily ironic) is easily over **1,000,000**.A million INNOCENT CIVILIANS dead by America's hand. Try to fight the emotional disconnect associated with such a large figure. Each and every single one of these people had a mom and a dad. Grandmas and grandpas. Maybe brothers and sisters. Cousins. Friends. Teachers. Every single one of these people had aspirations. Some would have been brilliant scientists, and others virtuosos of art. Each of these deaths haunt me, and I'm afraid that nothing I can ever write would properly illuminate the severity of these tragedies.My heart goes out to everyone affected by the Boston attack. It's heartrending even imagining the difficulty of dealing with something like this. My sympathies go out to you. I just hope that this tragedy does not arouse an anger in Americans that will result in the deaths of many, many more civilians. Any life is precious.EDIT: A few thoughts. 1) So I'm not accused of only showing one side of the coin, here are the numbers of innocent American civilians that died on home soil as a result of foreign attack.**78** civilians died in Pearl Harbour (although it was a military base, I will still count this for argument's sake).**6** people died in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.**3,000** died on 9/11.While tragic and devastating, the number is less than **3,084**. That is 0.3% of the **1,000,000** civilian deaths caused by the U.S., in the same time frame.2) I understand that this is an emotional topic, and I'm sorry if this post hurt anyone. You have to view this post in the context of the thread, however. If I wanted to bash Americans (a people who I love dearly), I would have made a thread to do so. If your initial psychological response to this post is disdain towards me, there is little I can do to change that. I have not presented a political stance. I have not applied any ideological slant to the information. However, if you are interested in having an intellectual discussion about this, I am here, open minded and willing to listen.Let's reiterate my point (as I have done so several times in this post and in responses throughout the thread):**As devastating and angering as the attack on Boston may be, Americans must be careful when looking for someone to blame. America has been responsible for tragedies way bigger in magnitude, without any real repercussions. Aggressively responding may result in even more unnecessary civilian casualties.**"
c9goayd,Meatsalad,"I'm an American that lives 30 minutes away from Boston. I agree with absolutely everything you said.

c9gun4w,Phantai,"Seriously? I can't at all see how that can be a morally defensible position. Using weapons of mass destruction in any real world context, is unnecessary and inexcusable. The concept of ""Total War"" carried a lot of weight when armies had muskets and cannons. Armies could barrage a city into surrender without wiping everyone out. Nowadays, a single coordinated attack can destroy dozens of cities in one go. That is not acceptable under any circumstances."
c9gv7tl,,"So you do realize that world war 2 was fought with muskets (rifles) and cannons primarily (more casualties produced by artillery than any other weapon) and that the fire bombing of tokyo using conventional bombs resulted in a greater loss of life than the individual nuclear bombs?Weapons of mass destruction will almost assuredly never be used by the U.S. or any rational country as a first strike weapon. However they are the deterrent of choice to prevent any rogue nation or state from popping off, and they are not going anywhere anytime soon."
c9gpu2l,minedom,"Not necessarily dead by Americas hand, mind you. While most of that appears to be correct, the Afghanistan, Iraq, and Gulf war figures are total. That means they do not discriminate between who caused said deaths."
c9gqmia,Phantai,"Thanks for pointing that out, and my apologies for the mistake. My point still stands, however."
c9gqpa2,minedom,"It stands fairly well. I would like to point out that deaths from the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are a drop in the bucket compared to the millions (from each side, including civilians) that it would have taken to end the war via ground invasion. That doesn't detract from your overall point, but sometimes war sucks less than it could have."
c9gokej,,"Total lie, the death total from the Japanese attacks was around 150K. The death toll from a US invasion would have been in the millions. The cities were not destroyed and exist today. Propaganda.""My Lai"" is another distortion. No where near the death toll stated and the perpetrators were punished.The ""bombing"" of Yugoslavia saved many lives. The most of which were Muslim Bosnians.......Sad propaganda and misinformation. But it is coming from a globalist, communist nut. I can understand it."

c9got6t,RetroJester1,"Good points, though, I feel both sides should cite sources."
c9gp2yt,Phantai,"Not sure if serious. Seems like a troll. But eh, what the fuck. The explosions themselves yielded a death toll of almost 200k confirmed deaths (http://www.atomicarchive.com/Docs/MED/med_chp10.shtml). This does not include bodies which were burnt to ash or bodies which were not found. I never claimed the entire cities were flattened into a desert. Some buildings survived, and the cities were reconstructed following the attack. It's also funny that you mention the possibility of an American invasion of Japan, as most historians (of those who are not American) agree that Japan was on the verge of surrendering before the bombs, and that any occupation would have received virtually no resistance. I'd love for you to address the napalm bombings of Vietnam and the widespread human rights violations of Operation Condor. Oh, and I find it pretty ironic that you accuse me of spreading propaganda (in reference to a post devoid of ideology), and then you call me a communist nut.Keep on truckin', I guess."

c9gp8o0,,"> The death toll from a US invasion would have been in the millionsThe Japanese had already agreed to surrender, the bombs were dropped to attain UNCONDITIONAL surrender (and the Japanese weren't asking for much), so your comparison is really a false choice; it wasn't kill 150k or lose millions to an assault. Our govt was just ramping up its neocolonialist agenda, using Japan as a satellite against Russia, and flaunting our nuclear power so the Soviets (and the world) knew who was in charge."

c9gqvcm,,"> In fact, there was an attempted palace coup AFTER the 2 nukes were dropped.Part of the UNCONDITIONAL surrender was disarmament (meaning all these generals lose their power) as well as what amounted to eradication of shintoism (with a divine Emperor leading the nation). This did not go over well. The council votes tied only due to three conditions of surrender; aka the UNCONDITIONAL surrender that Truman stubbornly insisted on."
c9gpn4o,ibowlwithquintana,Japan had not agreed to surrender before the bombs were dropped (See Operation Ketsugo). Please do not spew misinformation.
c9gq4dd,,"[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/15kb3w/why_didnt_japan_surrender_after_the_first_atomic/) on the issue. The Emperor had divine right, essentially God's word, and we wanted to strip him of it. Truman gave the most idiotic rationale for insisting on unconditional surrender, implying that he didn't want Japan to be another Germany, rearing its head again in a few decades. (In fact the harsh reparations imposed on Germany are now largely cited as the cause for German ""rebellion"")"
c9gr3bb,ibowlwithquintana,"I've read that article already. You said 'Japanese', implying the government as a whole had already agreed to surrender. This is technically not true. Rather, top leadership of the Japanese empire were split as to surrendering. I'm not arguing as to the ethics/morality of dropping the bomb. When Little Boy was dropped, Operation Ketsugo was still in effect."
c9gvnym,,"> top leadership of the Japanese empire were split as to surrendering.Yes, the council was split 3-3 on UNCONDITIONAL surrender. I originally said that the decision between dropping the bomb (150k dead) versus an outright invasion (millions dead) was a false choice. Surrender was all but assured, given the three cited conditions."
c9gw9rw,ibowlwithquintana,"Surrender was not all but assured. As I said, operations to defend the homeland were in full effect prior to the dropping of Little Boy as Japan was getting ready for a Fall campaign for the defense of the homeland. Your assertion that it was a false choice is all but conjecture. There are too many different theories of what what led to end of the war. Noted Japanese historians say that the bombings influenced the emperor to surrender whilst others say the Soviet entrance into the Pacific Theater influenced their decisions. But I'm not here to argue why or how they surrendered. Japan was still in a state of war against the US at the time Little Boy was dropped. Your original assertion that Japan surrendered before Little Boy was dropped is completely false and I still maintain that position."
c9gwiii,,> Your original assertion that Japan surrendered before Little Boy was dropped is completely false and I still maintain that position.Well you're delusional. The Potsdam declaration doomed hundreds of thousands of people to unnecessary deaths.

c9gq59j,Phantai,"Well, the point I was trying to make (implicitly) is that Americans tend to overreact when something happens on their soil, and that the U.S. is responsible for a great deal more innocent deaths abroad than it has endured at home. It is also very important to note that many innocent civilians were killed by the United States in an overreaction to something (e.g. Pearl Harbor, 9/11). But yes, you are right. I was being a little unfair. Let us compare the amount of civilian deaths that the U.S. has been responsible for in the last 70 years, and the number of civilian deaths that the U.S. has suffered on home soil in the last 70 years. **78** civilians died in Pearl Harbour (although it was a military base, I will still count this for argument's sake). **6** people died in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. **3,000** died on 9/11. While tragic and devastating, the number is less than **3,084**. That is 0.3% of the **1,000,000** civilian deaths caused by the U.S., in the same time frame."
c9gxg9f,dmol,">that many innocent civilians were killed by the United States in an overreaction to something (e.g. Pearl Harbor, 9/11). Not the best examples, both of the responses to these two incidents were the afghan war and the retaliation against japan.Both of these actions did cause more civilian deaths than than the initial attack on the us however it is again unfair to look at the situation through this prism without noting that the us response in turn removed the taliban from power and ended the japanese empires violent actions towards its neighbors.Both of these actions would have saved more lives than the number lives of those which were lost.Japans had to end its war against China which in the previous years alone killed about 10 million people. If it was allowed to continue a huge number of chinese civilian deaths would have continued to occur.The taliban were removed and since then afghans have reported that they have experienced less hardships in the post taliban era than they did during their rule.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/18_11_09_oxfam_afghan.pdf"
c9he8h1,Phantai,"You're right. The examples are not as good as they could have been. However, I disagree with the idea that they saved more lives than they cost.The Sino-Japanese war was not the reason the U.S. entered combat, and as absolutely brutal as the war was, the United States was not in any real position to intervene. I also do not agree with the position that the involvement saved lives. The pacific theatre of the war yielded 26 million civilian deaths, and 6 million military deaths. It did NOT stop the Sino-Japanese conflict (which still raged on despite the new theatre of war).On the recent wars, removal of the Taliban has yielded no real results. Afghanistan is still a mess. Iraq is just as bad (if not worse). The wars lasted more than a decade, racking up millions of casualties, all under the thin justification of the existence of imaginary WMDs. Americans are pretty much the only people in the world who are convinced that they improved the situation in the middle east. The rest of the world disagrees. The article you linked to is great, but you have to take into consideration that Afghanistan has been in a perpetual state of war since the Soviets invaded in 1979. Simply because Afghanistan is in better shape than it was in the 80s does not mean that American involvement made everything better."
c9hp7s4,dmol,">The Sino-Japanese war was not the reason the U.S. entered combat.The Japanese attack was, however the intervention of the US brought an end to japans aggressive rule of its asian territories, if these continued the high death figures which occurred before the intervention would have continued. >On the recent wars, removal of the Taliban has yielded no real results.Time and time again polling evidence has shown most afghans consider their lives better now than they did, this is a positive yield result.>Americans are pretty much the only people in the world who are convinced that they improved the situation in the middle east.Wheres the evidence for this?>The rest of the world disagrees.In regards to the greater middle east the majority of both libyans and afghans would agree with the intervention of the us.>Simply because Afghanistan is in better shape than it was in the 80s does not mean that American involvement made everything better.Not only is it better than the 80's it is also better than the period of the taliban rule, this rule did end due to us involvement and therefore it did play a part in making things better."

c9grbdf,mcivor_1,"Im Irish and it makes me really sad that people are actually trying to argue against this. Either way, if you got a few of your facts wrong or whether they are cited differently by different sources, the differences are not enough to discard what you have wrote. The incidents (not the numbers) speak for themselves and America should be ashamed for the atrocities that they have committed instead of trying to justify it. America is a relatively young country and a very young ""superpower"" and some might even say that they are similar to a young British Empire, forcing their views and attacking other countries to suit their agenda be it for resources or tactical advantage (as an Irishman I know this only too well). As a young ""superpower"" America is trying to put its stamp on the world just like others have done in the past however with the technological advances over the last century there is just no place for this ""dick-measuring contest"" otherwise we are going to have a lot of innocent people dying, whether it is intended or not is not a justification for doing such things. The facts are still unknown about the terrible incidents in Boston but the list of possible culprits is quite a long one due to America's recent history. The US government doesn't care about its citizens otherwise they wouldn't ""stir the hornets nest"" like they have done in recent history (e.g. 9/11). I compared America to a young British Empire and look at the Brits today, (generally) hated on a global scale with very little to show from their endeavors all those years ago because the people they oppressed eventually fought back and said no more. America needs to address this in future foreign policy before its too late and a nuclear war begins and we are right back to square one. In no way am I condoning these attacks on civilians in Boston and my heart goes out to those affected but as a citizen of Earth it also goes out to those in the Middle East. Its all about empathy in the furthering of mankind!"

A total of about 11,000 civilian deaths in both Iraqi Wars and the Afghanistan wars combined are directly attributed to the US military. All 11,000 weren't personally shot by soldiers, collateral damage counts as well. THE REST OF THE DEATHS WERE BY THEIR OWN PEOPLE."
c9gzaba,FR05TB1T3,So by your logic the US should never intervene anywhere ever because they might kill some civilians.
c9hduih,Phantai,"No. The U.S. should intervene when such an action is justified. Unfortunately, a majority of US intervention was NOT justified (Korea, Vietnam, Latin America, Afghanistan, Iraq)."
c9gpw0f,Alreadyhaveone,What do you think the death toll would have been if the US would have invaded Japan? Do you know anything about the atrocities they committed either? Not these points are really even relevant. DAE AMERICA EVIL?!?!
c9gqi51,Phantai,"Is it possible that a drawn-out land war would have engulfed the island of Japan? Maybe. It's also quite possible that an invasion would have met little resistance (as many international historians argue). I'm not going to jump into a heated debate about whether or not Japan was truly going to surrender in this thread. It's a fascinating discussion, and I'd love to talk about it (many on a history subreddit?) but it's somewhat irrelevant to the point I was making.My objective was to present a statistical overview of the innocent deaths the U.S. has been responsible for in the last half century. Just as you may find these actions justifiable, someone who has had their entire family brutally slaughtered by U.S. drone attacks would probably find bombing America justifiable. Let's not get mixed in relative perspectives, and let's look at the cold hard facts.I'm also well aware that wartime atrocities are not uncommon for any country. The Rape of Nanking is an example of some of the disgusting things that the Japanese military was responsible for. Nevertheless, please do not derail the discussion. I never claimed that America is the only country to have committed an atrocity. I merely want to point out that the atrocities committed heavily outweigh the atrocities endured."

c9gsmq1,ZoltaK,"Japan kills millions a lot of which were civilians but Fuck America for doing that to poor innocent Japan.""Altogether, during the war the North Korean communists probably killed near 500,000 Koreans (excluding at least 6,000 killed by the South-line 152), including their own citizens (line 95). With a probable 1,500,000 civilians killed in the war (line 81), this democide seems, if anything, an underestimate and the true figure may be closer to the high democide calculation of almost 775,000 dead (line 95). "" 'Again Fuck America.http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP3.HTMYea fuck America, the only Country in the World to have kill millions of innocent civilians. Lets tell Americans not to get angry when civilians are killed just like every other country that didn't get angry with an act of violence was committed against them. That means not country should ever get angry, we are all guilty of living in a country that has killed innocent civilians. America is not the only country that needs to changes it ways. Mankind is incapable of acting peaceful on a grand scale, yes we can be peaceful in small groups but we fucking suck at getting along on a global scale. This was a peaceful global event that just happened to be in the USA. Many innocent civilians from numerous of countries were affected, for fuck sakes one of the dead was a Chinese national http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/16/us/boston-marathon-victims-profiles/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 . The whole world should be angry that someone or some group would infect pain and suffering to a peaceful, joyous occasion. Now I am not saying that anger should lead to the deaths of innocent people but it should lead to justice. And to sit here and to basically say this tragedy is meaningless compared to numerous of other tragedies is fucking stupid. Even if you do not mean to sound like a douche, you do."
c9gsxb3,Phantai,"Did you read my post at all? Fuck America? When did I say that? Where the hell are you getting this? I get that you're angry, but I don't understand why you're directing your anger towards me. I love America. I love Americans. I hate atrocities committed by ANYONE. It's simply important to be mindful of the fact that rash emotional responses to these events do not end well for anyone involved.Furthermore, I specifically mentioned in the original posts that most of the atrocities committed in the Korean war were committed by Koreans, not Americans. So I have no idea what point you're trying to prove."
c9gte8o,ZoltaK,"Yes I read your post. You say you love America and Americans but you are basically saying you can't feel bad for only a few dieing because your government has killed millions over the years. Your post tries to take away from the tragic nature of this attack. I point I was making was that EVERY country is to blame for killing innocent civilians and that EVERY country has the right to mourn and get angry over an attack done to them. I agree with that rash emotional responses to these events do not end well but I also think it is adds to the anger in these situation when someone basically say ""hey its not as bad as what you have done in the past""."
c9gtuv5,Phantai,"Even though you had an opportunity to actually read the content, you choose to lie. Clearly, you did NOT read my post.""My heart goes out to everyone affected by the Boston attack. It's heartrending even imagining the difficulty of dealing with something like this. My sympathies go out to you. I just hope that this tragedy does not arouse an anger in Americans that will result in the deaths of many, many more civilians.""It's not about every country having the right to get angry. Not every country can throw their weight around like the United States. Not one. I want you to look at this, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures, and let those numbers sink in.The only state in recent memory that rivalled the military might of the U.S. was the Soviet Union. If you look at the history, you'll see that both countries (USA and USSR) threw their weight around their regions, committing countless atrocities without any real repercussion. The opposition kept them in check for seemingly neutral territories (which didn't always work, but it was something). Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, only one country remains that has the military budget to commit mass atrocity without any real opposition: the U.S.A. A country that consistently ignores pleas of every other developed country in the world when making foreign policy decisions. American citizens are victim too. Their taxes are syphoned into an unnecessarily bloated military budget that could pretty much solve most of America's economic problems. I fear for Americans. I do not want American citizens shipped off to die in a new conflict because war profiteering corporations syphon money straight from taxes.The United States, at the very least for the last 70 years, has involved itself in poorly justified conflicts, and nobody can do a damn thing. This is why it's important for Americans to not make rash decisions at such an emotional time."
c9h5430,,"It's people like you that have absolutely no historical perspective or critical thinking skills. First, the United States doesn't deliberately target civilians as a military strategy. Why do you think we've gone to all the trouble of developing smart bombs and other advanced weapons technology? Second, you're throwing out casualty numbers without any context. Civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, are not categorized by who caused the death. If you look into it, you'll find the majority are caused by enemy combatants (suicide bombings of markets, polling stations, etc.) But I'm sure that doesn't matter to you, because all you want to do is compare total deaths to make the US seem like the big bad guy and we all shouldn't be making such a big fuss of those people who died in Boston. Grow up and educate yourself."
c9hdtsb,Phantai,"No need for personal attacks. They only detract from the point you are trying to make. Firstly, I'd like you to do some research on Operation Condor. Then you can tell me about how civilians aren't deliberately targeted as a military strategy. Either way though, whether the action is deliberate or not, the consequence is very real. Secondly, civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan may not all have died at the hands of American soldiers, but they all occurred as a result of an unjustified American invasion. You accuse me of not having any historical perspective or critical thinking skills, and yet you choose to ignore the fact that neither one of those wars had a single real justification. Hundreds of thousands innocent dead, for what? Invisible WMDs? Yet, both conflicts were made possible through the anger and implicit support of the American people.As for the context -- I think I made that pretty clear. All of the figures I posted were from conflicts that the U.S. really had no place participating in (with the questionable exception of WWII). It doesn't matter if American soldiers are deliberately shooting innocents (which they still do fairly often). What matters is that they shouldn't even be overseas in the first place. A country with the military might of the United States should not be so gung-ho to jump into a new conflict. Lastly, you seem to have a case of selective reading. I never said we shouldn't make a ""fuss"" about the people who died in Boston. I think that every one of those people (and all of those injured/affected by the attack) needs our support and sympathy. Not the sort of anger that has gotten America locked into dozens of unjustified conflicts that resulted in even more civilian deaths (not to mention the deaths of young American soldiers).How is that for perspective?"

c9guo0q,dingoperson,">I don't think any of you feel the same about the rape and murder of a 14 year old Iraqi girl and her family as you do about the bombing in Boston. That's Greenwald's point and I think it's a valid one.But this just tells me that you are literally pretty much devoid of empathy - because you don't see that these are radically different situations. It's like you are programmed to act in line with what an empathic person would feel, but actually don't feel empathy yourself."
c9h6g2r,kingweee,"It's hard for me to respond to your post because I don't really understand what you are trying to say.I think you are saying that I don't have empathy because I don't see the difference between the two situations. As you say, they are radically different. In what way?"
c9h8mtc,dingoperson,"I am saying precisely this, to quote myself: ""But this just tells me that you are literally pretty much devoid of empathy - because you don't see that these are radically different situations.""The Boston terrorists probably acted either fully in line with the aims of a wider organization, or as a minimum on their own initiative. The US soldiers mentioned acted expressly contrary to the aims of an organization they were part of had taken an oath to follow. The US soldiers had been trained and ordered to avoid harm to civilian Iraqis. The organization they belonged to has already sent the perpetrators through the criminal system. The perpetrators in the Boston bombing are still at large.The number of victims is dramatically different. The long term consequences are dramatically different.To expand on that first line again - you presume that I somehow ""should"" feel the same about these events. I have many relevant reasons to feel differently about them - in the sense that they are all tragic and reprehensible, but different types of tragic and reprehensible in different contexts. You are not empathic enough to even be aware of my perspective."

Because you're from Boston, you're too grief-stricken to step back and think for a moment? This article isn't anti-American, and it shouldn't be viewed as anti-American to examine our flaws as a country. That's ignorant. This tragedy made me sick to my stomach. It's fucking awful. But the very very tiny silver lining in this is that it did make me empathize with those in countries less fortunate than the U.S. When we started the war in Iraq over a decade ago, I didn't give a shit. I was young and didn't know any better, and I know plenty of Americans much older and wiser than me didn't give a shit either. How many innocent Iraqis died directly because of our presence there? They went through tragedies like this on a daily basis, and for the most part, America didn't care. Maybe people will care more after this. It's so easy to detach ourselves from people who look, speak, and act totally different from us, separated by an ocean. But really, they are just like us.I'm just saying, how can it hurt to constructively criticize America's attitude as a whole towards the countries we have invaded? It doesn't make us non-American, it just makes us more understanding, empathetic Americans."

I don't think what he said was out of line. I draw the line when someone uses a tragedy to immediately make a political statement. I don't consider this a political statement, I consider this a statement for all of America. Also, the way you come off after saying ""take this 'teachable moment' and shove it up your ass"" is very different from the way you come off after your last post. I probably read into the attitude of your original statement too much."

No. I'm not OK with that."

When they approve for strikes on UNKNOWN targets. > Sure, there has been collateral damage in drone strikes and we should work on reducing them.That kind of thinking is the murderous and toxic mindset that allows for atrocities to happen. When you just bomb people here and there, many times without knowing, classifying everyone as a militant for the purposes of propaganda; you're certain that you will murder lots of people who have done absolutely nothing.Imagine if your home was bombed, killing your family, in the ""war against drugs"" and the government said, well, we're working on reducing the collateral damage (all while maintaining the same record of murder and ""mistakes"" ultimately coming to a point where there are no mistakes any more and you're just classified as ""drug crime related target"").Furthermore, what gives USA (or any other country) the right to murder people around the world, at their whim without regards to sovereignty?> But to claim this is a similar type of attack is ridiculous moral equivalency. YOU are ridiculous. Looking excuses for the murders of your government because you pretend to be in the right. You're the ""good guys"" after all and you don't actually give a shit who dies as long as they're not your fellow Americans (if they look like you?) at home.You're the type of people who allows genocides unless they affect them directly and, worse, you actively cheer for them."

I don't care about ambiguous ""good intentions"" or ""freedom"" or any other bullshit propaganda you're going to spew next.

The US gov military and security depts have the worst reputation on the planet for pulling dirty underhanded shit to further their own ends.

Hitler: 20 million in the Soviet Union alone. We can keep going. No, you don't get to use stupidly inflated figures of civilian deaths.

We're humans and prone to catastrophic lapses in judgement.But to take a moment like this, with INNOCENT people suffering, to step up on your soap box and proclaim how ""next time, perhaps you should think of -insert country here-"" is incredibly thoughtless and erases any message about peace you're trying to convey. These victims weren't political figures and had nothing to do with ANY policy. I'm saddened to hear of the INNOCENT deaths occurring over the globe, but I don't believe living in America should rob me of my right to grieve for my country also. The people here in the states do many great things as well such as medical advancements, humanitarian work, etc. But get back on your pulpits. The left can talk about gun control, the right can talk about freedom, and countries in glass houses can continue throwing stones.

I think it's great that people are relating the attack in Boston to the attacks which get ignored every day all over the world.

Incidental civilian deaths are awful, but it's human nature that the emotional response to tragedy is often dictated by the motives and circumstance.Death is death, but how people respond to it varies tremendously and I don't understand why this is coming as a revelation to so many people today. The Second Congo Civil War was the deadliest conflict since WWII. How many people in this thread have openly grieved for the 5.4 million people killed in that? I would guess not many, because it occurred in a place they have no relation with, involving people they have no relation with. I doubt many people in the Congo are openly grieving the people killed in Boston, or the people killed in Iraq. I doubt the people in Iraq are openly grieving anyone killed in the U.S. or Africa.

c9gw5j2,uninc4life2010,"I have to be honest here, and I will undoubtably be down voted, but I don't really feel any sadness or rage concerning this attack. While I acknowledge that it is tragic, I just don't feel any real emotions. Boston is too far away, and I do not know a single individual affected to be emotionally moved. The fear based responses and those who will undoubtable use this event to their political advantage do however stir my emotional cauldron quite strongly."

c9gwqx6,,> You don't feel any real emotions when you see a photo of a guy with his legs blown off or a dead girl lying on the street?!Not for people in Boston because I've seen too many of them in the UK thanks to Boston funded IRA bombs.
c9gwzhi,all2humanuk,"That's pretty sad really and shows you do feel emotion, the same kind of sectarian hatred that fuelled the IRA."
c9gw9wp,plughxyzzy,"Sorry dude. I'm the same. I'm Australian and this has as much effect on me as seeing dead Iraqis or Afghanis or Pakistanis in bombings.I feel empathy for the individuals. But it's a distant empathy. It does not wear on me over the day. It's just ""oh that's sad"" then I forget it.This obviously means more to US citizens than it does the rest of the world. I mean, that is obvious, right?"
c9gwdes,all2humanuk,well empathy is feeling emotion so is sadness. Not dwelling on it's fine I was just shocked that someone would say they felt no real emotion. I think as a father it's impossible not to feel some empathy when you hear the story of a family's life ripped apart like the Richards. That said I certainly don't feel rage.

But I say these things from the comfort of my home, with my internet and Fritos. I simply can't put myself in someone's shoes that had their family tortured and murdered by Saddam's regime, or suffered a similar fate for being at the wrong place at the wrong time in any of the islamic heavy countries. We like to pretend that it's just a few extremists, and therefor a wasted effort...and while we may create new enemies because of how we conduct this war...what most people don't realize, is that islam has only one goal...to extinguish life. There are islamic parties with a mushroom cloud on their flag. There are entire factions in this world that will behead you for disagreeing with them.You cannot reason with someone...that thinks they have god on their side. You cannot reason with someone that doesn't respect a woman's equality. Religion can cause those people to kill eachothers children, for simply being a different *sect* of the *same religion*. Like I said, there are better ways to do it though, which is why I don't appreciate the war we're in now. Finally, a lot of people will say that the extremists are a tiny minority and that they don't represent the whole...But in the same way that the Westboro Baptist church is a minority in the U.S....by very nature of the bible, most christians have no counter argument against them...it's because the fundmanetalists actually *read* the bible, and take it *literally* that we must worry, in the same way that the moderate muslims cannot argue against the extremists. From a biblical viewpoint...you simply can't argue for equality for gays or women...because the bible is a cruel and malicious document...which is why we may make fun of the WBC now...but look at the direction our country is headed...look at the level of discourse we have...look how our children are unimaginably cruel to gay students, and dismissive of rape perpetrated against women. Those ideas come from a male dominated christianity. And Islam is far worse than that."

Firstly - as said - their incompetent. Secondly, we have an entire system dedicated to catching such people and bringing them to justice.

c9gt35d,IntaroBang,"This article is a bit like comparing apples to oranges. The vast majority of the attacks the US is responsible for around the world are not targeted specifically at civilians unlike what happened in Boston. Are there sometimes mistakes? Yes. Those are indeed tragedies and nobody could argue they are not. However, it is very easy to start to get into a grey area when you get civilians as collateral damage, and it is more of a philosophy debate than anything else. For instance - lets say you know with 95% certainty that if you do not bomb a building housing a person who is plotting an attack, tens if not hundreds of people will die. You know he has the means for it. You've seen him purchase weapons. You've uncovered his plans. You just do not know if he actually has the guts to carry it out. You have the means to stop him. However, the only place you can with any amount of certainty take him out before the attack contains 5 innocents - do you do it? More than likely you are saving lives in the scheme of things but to do so, you will surely kill people who have nothing to do with it.It is a tough question with no correct answer. Am I saying every situation is like this? Of course not. The US has made some pretty bad mistakes whether through action or inaction - but you can never know the right course until after the fact. Hindsight is 20/20 after all."
c9gtjxo,sleet01,"Did you even read the article? He's not comparing the attacks themselves; he's saying that people are going to feel similar levels of emotions in either case and, after we have grieved for our own, we can express empathy by understanding how the survivors in other countries feel as well."
c9gxz8h,IntaroBang,"I did read it, but I just feel that the amount of empathy one can feel should correlate to what the attack was for. If the attack had purpose and saved lives by ultimately taking them, while I'd grieve for that loss - for the sacrifice we are forcing others to make - I would not feel nearly as bad as an attack only on civilians. One kind of attack is worse than another in my book and it should change how we feel about them."

I love how soldeirs here who use those wepons from a safe distance have the nerve to call other murderers cowards, not that they aren´t, but so are you. The death rate of U.S soldiers in the Irak war, in relation to soldiers enlisted is less then the death reate of miners in poor countries, and close to workers on large building sites. I know some soldiers risk their lives more than others, but most of them are pretty safe, at a safe distance behind their multi-billion dollar joystick weponry.Not all military operations are morally undjust... but just about every one the USA has run the last 50 years, more or less, is. Being a soldier who went to another country to shot people, and have the gall to come here and claim you are on a moral high ground, is a sure sign that these kinds of attacks (wherever they may land) are going to continue. It is morons like you that make them happen.

There is no reason for anybody to get bombed in Boston. there is no such thing as a possibility for collateral damage in the streets of Boston. When there is an insurgent force firing upon a bunch of troops in the middle east, there is going to be collateral damage. we can't have all of our wars in the middle of a field with no civilians around. that type of warfare died years ago. that being said, there are soldiers that do kill random civilians randomly for no apparent reason. These soldiers are in the middle of a war zone, many have friends who were killed, and these people may have a psychotic break and kill innocent civilians. while it doesn't count as an adequate excuse, it's expected. Historically speaking, you always hear stories about soldiers raping and pillaging the towns they swept through. that is the cost of war unfortunately. Boston is not a war zone.

I'm pretty sure there aren't very many people being killed by American troops in cities and towns where there aren't any American troops stationed. way to point out one irrelevant discrepancy in my statement, and ignore what i was actually saying."
c9grhsy,gramie,"The discrepancy in your statement was the entire first sentence, and the basis for your argument. It's not exactly nit-picking.The generally accepted number of [over100,000 Iraqis dying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Iraq_War) would imply that American troops are responsible for more than a few civilian deaths."
c9gs05c,remnantsofthepast,"66,000 civilians dead according to the website that leaked information from army field reports over the course of 5 years (between 2004 and 2009) where around 4,000 of which were in the initial invasion. Imagine that. People die when there's a war outside of their door. Conventional warfare means that there will be collateral damage. Boston is not in an area where there is conventional warfare going on. It is a well-developed city in a first world country that has no foreign power currently occupying it for military reasons. Also, i apologize if you misunderstood what i meant when i said ""...all these other places..."" i thought that the readers of Reddit would have some sort of intelligence to realize that i wasn't saying that there was a full scale war over the entire span of the Arabian peninsula.

c9grl0e,moonroots64,"But why is US Foreign policy, by definition, not terrorism? I don't see a reason why a government is incapable of terrorism (although I know you aren't making that claim exactly). I personally don't believe we had sufficient ""justification"" to invade Iraq, and if we lack that... why are we any different than terrorists when our actions end up murdering thousands of innocent mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, human beings... people."
c9grrc2,smellyfots,"Terrorism is very specific: deliberate violence against noncombatants to induce fear for a political purpose. None of that describes the US invasion of Iraq. It has never been US policy to deliberately kill civilians. Seriously, that is patently obvious. Yes, civilians died in the tumult associated with the US invasion. Then again correlation isn't causation, is it? Assuming that was US policy is taking a leap of blind (unwarranted) faith. It's essentially arguing from a position where you label the US is the bad guy a priori. Kinda like Noam Chomsky."
c9gs03w,moonroots64,"Ok, fair point about the definition of terrorism. But perhaps government sponsored invasion of a country for (what I believe is) no legitimate reason is perhaps worse. We murdered many people doing it, and although we didn't target them specifically, why should that be the ONLY consideration? We knew they would die, in any major war civilians will, by almost logical certainly, die. And the US made a deliberate decision to go to war. In my mind, although there is a very large moral difference between intentional murder and accidental murder, it doesn't fully excuse responsibility just because you didn't intend a specific bomb to kill specific citizens. We started a war we knew would murder civilians, that leaves a moral residue on our hands. We intentionally put our country in a position where we knew innocent people would die in the thousands, and we had no sufficient justification for doing it."
c9hakzq,smellyfots,"You use the term murder way to loosely. In fact, its just plain incorrect. Murder is a civil society term. It is totally out of place in a war zone. This is not to absolve killing but to note that it is legally distinct from killing during peacetime. When armed combatants kill each other that is not murder. When civilians die as a byproduct from warfare, and not because of it, that is not murder. Just because you don't believe there was a legitimate reason for invading Iraq doesn't automatically make US troops murderers. That is totally insensitive and just stupid to be honest."
c9hpvyt,moonroots64,"You're really fixated on narrow definitions. Let me know if you're interested in actually responding my main points. I assumed you were intelligent enough to understand what I generally meant by ""murder"" while discussing a larger and more important issue.

And I'm sad for those people too. Hearing about a girl shot because she had the audacity to go to school makes me look at my niece and be thankful she's here and not there.

I WILL BE SAD AND GRIEVE IN MY OWN WAY AND IF IT ISN'T HOW YOU THINK I SHOULD DO IT, YOU CAN JUMP OFF A CLIFF. I LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT DOES SOME BAD THINGS AND SO DO YOU. One more thing: I know it hurts to say this, but the US did not cause all of the problems in Afghanistan or Iraq. Children were dying and civilians were living in horrible conditions long before we arrived. Read up on Sadaam from 1979 to the first Iraqi war in 1990 and tell me how wonderful things were and how so few innocents were slaughtered. I guess if the US had stayed out of both wars, the regime would have become family friendly and an era of peace like no other would have been ushered in by Uday after Sadaam's death.

c9gozxa,,"They hit me first . . . That is what my kid says. If it all comes down to that, then we should go through the history books and see exactly who really hit who first. I am taking from the beginning of recorded history. Anyway, if this was retaliation for some horrific thing the USA did, I would think the responsible party would put their big boy pants on and take responsibility. That way, we can say they hit us first. The difference is that when we do it, we will at least make some attempt not to kill civilians."
c9gsfc8,DevonWeeks,"Tell him to gripe to the UN. Most conflicts we are involved in involve UN police actions and are joint operations with several other countries. We only provide the bulk of the manpower for those operations because we have a substantially larger military than the other countries involved. Iraq? Iran? Fine. You want to bring up Kosovo, Bosnia, or others and you can look to the UN Security Council. I'd be more than happy to bring our men and women home and let the Yugoslavians butcher each other. Same goes for Syria. Let them run the streets red with their OWN blood. They don't need our help. But, then these other countries would all cry a river about how we are not ""fulfilling our international obligations"" or some other tripe. We haven't dedicated ground troops to Syria. What does British news say? ""Where are the Americans? President Obama has to do something!"" You see, that nonsense is why most Americans stopped caring about what the world thinks. Quite frankly, none of you really know what you want aside from knowing you want to angry about something."
c9gsib6,wtfredditstopittt,"I read the entire article. I still don't understand it. He makes the argument that we should feel empathy for those in the Middle East that are killed by U.S. bombings ""everyday"". I do. I think most Americans do. The obvious difference, and the one he chooses to neglect, is that while those tragedies are not intended, these bombings in Boston clearly are. I don't believe the U.S. actively targets groups of innocent civilians and bombs them. Even his example of the bombing in Iraq on Monday is mediocre at best, saying it is the result of the U.S. invasion. While I don't think we ever should have been there, to say that us going there RESULTED IN these deaths is a poor argument indeed. It was ethnic violence.He also really loves to post examples from media outlets, including the shit that the NY Post writes, as a barometer of American reactions. This in itself is rather ironic, coming from another journalist trying to get a reaction out of people with sensationalist headlines and opportunistic writing. He calls it ""palpable"". I'm sorry, are you in Boston like I am right now? No? Didn't think so. Because the predominant reaction to yesterday is, ""how can I help"".Make no mistake, I'm angry. I want justice. Whoever did this can't run from a bunch of marathoners. I think this article is vapid, feeds off of the emotions of people who are justified in being emotional, and, ironically enough, fear mongers people into fearing for our civil liberties."
c9gst5b,,"Except that in many cases those dead in those countries are using human shields, whereby in Boston it was human targets.I fully understand and condemn the literally hundreds of dead children from Americas' drone program. But that is the lack of empathy on the government's part. And cannot be compared to a marathon bombing. Nobody's storing ak47s or plotting the downfall of a third world nation in that marathon. No body was trying to establish a caliphate and using children as shields. They were just running."
c9gtazj,,"Yes, yes, yes, We Americans are cold, heartless, and evil. You better believe we hate everyone in the middle east, and have never felt bad for anyone from any other country. We don't contribute the largest amount of foreign aid to help people. Nor have any of us been against war. Now don't you brits have a Margaret Thatcher death to be partying about?"
c9gtjh3,xcvb3459,It's sickening the way bloggers try to pimp a crisis like this for their own attention. The author compared apples and oranges and did a horrible job doing it.

c9gnqjw,Mr_Owl42,"The moderate muslims had a big battle to fight to stop the extremists among their religion and prove that theirs was a religion of peace. They didn't, so when innocents died as a result of extremist action the policing-U.S. took action to stop them itself. From this perspective, it looks like they brought this on themselves. The people of the U.S. have paid a lot of money and exerted a lot of man-power to try and deter terrorists and maintain security. So I couldn't give two shits about their rage; fix your damn country so that we don't have to keep our people from dying by fixing your problems. This applies to any country."
c9goqrh,Superkroot,"To be fair, a good deal of the turmoil going on in the middle east is from the meddling of the US and Russia during the cold war. The Taliban probably wouldn't have nearly as much power had the US not armed and trained them to fight against the Soviets."
c9gquq2,ScotchforBreakfast,The US never armed nor trained the Taliban. That's a lie.
c9gry65,Superkroot,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone The US as well as other intelligence agencies supplied arms and funds to Afghan mujahideen who were fighting against the Soviets. Many of the mujahideen, including Osama Bin Laden, later started the Taliban movement. I'll correct myself that they didn't train them, at least not directly, but gave them a lot of support and arms, including stinger missiles which terrorist groups have used against commercial airlines before."
c9gs38z,ScotchforBreakfast,The Mujahideen are not the same as the Taliban.Read your own wiki link.Osama Bin Laden is not a Taliban. He's Al Qadea.
c9goaky,whatdoiwantsky,Most decent citizens of the world have to keep their head down because their countries are run by a fundamentalist cabal backed by the military. The US government used the threat of imminent destruction in order to attack Iraq and bail out the banks. See how easy it is to fall sway to bullies?
c9gohvq,Mr_Owl42,"Yes, I do understand what you are saying. My biggest contention, however, is that I do not think the U.S. should sit idly by while they get manipulated and killed by terrorists operating in other countries."
c9gp0yx,whatdoiwantsky,"Not many would say that we have sat idly, unless you're one of those ""nuke em to glass"" types. However, i didn't read that to be your original point either. The terrorist issue as it regards developed countries is one of asymmetric warfare. Besides, the national security problem of late has been domestic terrorism. I don't see it abating nor would it surprise me to learn the Boston bomber/s were actually American."
c9gpcp3,Mr_Owl42,"My comment about not sitting ""idly by"" is one that is meant to defend the actions of the U.S. I think that although the countries in question may not have been capable of suppressing the violent among them, the U.S. still isn't guilty of completely unreasonable actions. My exist clause here is that, although I may sound like it, I'm not personally attached to these arguments; they simply make sense to me. But, I make them because I don't want the rest of the world mistaking me and my country as the true criminals. I think the U.S. acted, at least somewhat, with good intentions.Edit: I also agree that the most recent issue may be of domestic origin. I have no convincing opinion on the subject."
c9gnxl6,Sailer,"What do you mean when you say ""We don't have to keep our people from dying by fixing your problems.""?"
c9godb3,Mr_Owl42,"First, you took that quote straight out of the sentence, and it doesn't really make sense as you stated it. The statement is, ""fix your damn country so that we don't have to keep our people from dying by fixing your problems.""What I mean is that if a society, society ""A"" for instance, harbors a group of violent individuals who harm people in other societies, society ""B"", then that is a problem in society A. Society A is responsible for the actions of the criminals that they don't deal with. If those criminals harm society B, then I'd say that society B has every right to retaliate to protect itself."
c9glj6b,Tidurious,"So, collateral damage during a time of war is comparable to a terrorist attack on a completely random population? I don't think so. Like it or not, we're at war in those countries and collateral damage happens; it is *absolutely not the same as a terrorist attack against a peaceful gathering*."
c9gnlb8,VEGETABLE_FART,"the intent is different, the result is the same, i.e. innocent deaths"
c9gpklo,Mr_Owl42,Intent is a lot. A least in the developed world. Intent is the difference between manslaughter and homicide.
c9gmcw0,ihavenocoolname,"Away with your exceptionalism. What of the US bombs that land in the night on families sleeping in their homes? Of your cruise missiles that demolish weddings and funerals? Are these not peaceful gatherings?Yeah, you're in a state of perpetual war. An illegal war of aggression. A war where the 'enemy' poses no threat to you whatsoever (unless you find brown skin threatening). Bombs from your country fall in lands you're not at war with, The only relevant criterion is that they resemble a military-age male from the gun sights of a helo.Go suck on the memory of Pearl Harbor. That bitter taste is your hypocrisy."
c9go5vv,Mr_Owl42,"I hate using analogies for human lives, but look at it this way: Imagine that your neighbors are a family of people who all live in one big house together. They mostly live peacefully and you think nothing of them. But, a single one of them in their family acts up and assaults the other members of the family and occasionally assaults you. You warn your friendly neighbors that they need to pacify the dangerous among them, or you're going to have to take matters into your own hands. They do little, and you get assaulted again. How long should you take this abuse? When you ask the neighborhood for help, they respond with fear of getting involved and/or indifference. You know that your neighbors are oppressed by the hostile member of their group and in the end you would be doing them a favor by neutralizing them. However, they would be hurt by you disposing of their plight. Or, do you simply act with indifference and continue letting everyone get beat up by this lone, hostile character?Moral: When the problems of other societies starts killing U.S. citizens, do you simply expect the U.S. to do nothing?"
c9goe1a,IWantAnE55AMG,Or maybe you should find out why he's antagonizing you in the first place. Maybe he doesn't like how you always involve yourself in his family's business or provide support to his abusive father. Or you could just set fire to the house and wonder why more of his family is mad at you.
c9gp0sz,ihavenocoolname,"Sounds like your solution to a problem with one guy is to set the entire neighbourhood on fire. If one neighbour is guilty they all are, right? The most important thing is that you get your way. While we're at it, remember that Norwegian dickhead Breivik? Killed 77 people. Let's go destroy Sweden's infrastructure, overthrow their PM, loot their iron ore and kill 8,000 of its citizens. Ten years later, we'll admit that we knew Sweden had nothing to do with it the whole time, and start beating the war drum for Finland. After all, there are lots of white people there, and many of them are Christian and/or right-wing, and can rightfully be tarred with the same brush. That seems like a proportional response, right? Right?Moral: One of the myriad problems with other societies is the United States' foreign policy."
c9gpj08,IWantAnE55AMG,I believe we are making the same point.
c9gsfaf,ihavenocoolname,"Ah yes, I invoke Poe's Law. The danger of diverting attention between Reddit and work. Well, I hope we both had fun thinking up stupid metaphors :D"
c9heij2,Mr_Owl42,"Comparing Sweden and/or Norway (two of the most developed countries on the planet with amazing standards of living) to Iraq, Afghanistan, or nearly any country in the Middle East, is a mistake. That analogy is ... I digress.Not to mention that other countries' terrorists don't kill dozen to thousands of U.S. civilians at a time. Those countries actually deal with their criminals in a responsible fashion.Now, while it seems difficult to defend the U.S.'s involvement in Iraq, the truth stands that Saddam Hussein killed millions of his own people. The inaction of the UN is a despicable lack of human decency. Lest you rather him still alive, I believe the U.S. deserves more credit for actually following through with what the UN wouldn't. I don't care if the U.S. gave him power in the first place or not, the fact of the matter is that stopping him was the right thing to do."
c9gokns,Mr_Owl42,So we end up killing the abusive father while he takes the house down with him.
c9gwvf4,scobes,I don't think my first reaction would be to shoot a different guy in the face...Not sure about this analogy.
c9gxv6i,Temporomandibular,You couldn't have said it better my friend
c9gowqk,Superkroot,"In this analogy, the way the US is handling this situation with one bad person living in a big house together with others is blowing up the damn house, or at least the living room.Sure it works, but couldn't you just protect yourself from the assaulter? There are better ways to protect ourselves from terrorist threats. All this collateral damage is doing nothing to help with the bigger goal America needs which is represent itself in such a way to the world that these terrorist groups don't get new recruits that just had their city burned to the ground. These extremist groups wouldn't get so many willing participants if the hate didn't run so deep."
c9gp5vj,Mr_Owl42,"The protection they would force you to use is part of the terrorism itself. Once they evoke a response from you, they've already partially succeeded. Not to mention that you can't completely protect yourself from every possible assault. I also don't buy the notion that the terrorists exist because we tried to stop them.Look at Japan, they had more reason to hate the U.S. than just about anyone on the planet after WWII, and yet they didn't end up flying airplanes into the World Trade Centers. Their society did something that the societies harboring these terrorist organizations are not doing."
c9gxwky,Temporomandibular,"You know damn well if the US didn't get involved with it and try to help, people like you would bitch about it and say that we should be doing something to help those people. It's the same way with the nazis in ww2. The US knew about death and concentration camps, but refused to get involved. Refused to get involved for reasons like that. People would blame the US for the problems."
c9gqw2r,RealDirtyDirty,"Fuck...you. as we all know, england isnt fighting right along the side of the US. Suck on the bitter taste of shut the fuck up. The news made the boston bombing big not the citizens. The government drops bombs...I dont. So again shut the fuck up."

Extremely high standard of living, great economy, and technically speaking a fairly new country."
c9hnwnk,Dave1962,"What color is the sky in your world?1) America is by far the most influential country in the world that still embodies those aspects normally associated with capitalism (eg. private property rights, free market, etc.). They pay and provide the majority of services in the UN, Nato, Red Cross, etc..2) A monopoly can't exist in a laissez faire capitalist systems. Monopolies are only possible with government intervention in an economy. Despite what your socialist professors have told you.3) Bullshit. This must be why so many people flocked to this country, especially when it was founded, right? To ""be destroyed"".4) Nothing in this response addresses the fact that America has had a net ""positive"" effect rather than a ""negative"" one. Also, bullshit. The issue being discussed is not ""success"" although America wins on that count too. I guess those collectivist societies of China & USSR really set back your sides score, you know, what with murdering tens of millions of their own people. Please don't split hairs concerning the specific types of collectivism practiced by them, it doesn't matter.5) Austria would not even exist if the US hadn't kicked the Nazis out.They weren't so doing so well 70 years ago, and this still doesn't negate the positive influence of America, in fact, it reinforces it.Try again collectivist."
c9hx70e,AegusVii,"How are China and the USSR ""my side""? This isn't ""America vs The World"". If you're implying they're socialist countries, then you're clinically retarded. They're not even communist, they're more of a group dictatorship, and if you didn't know that already then you obviously have never had a world politics class in your life.A monopoly thrives in a laissez faire capitalist system. You clearly have no understanding of what laissez faire means if you think that it stops monopolies.Finally, the NAZIs would never have existed if it weren't for the US. US interference in European politics is why Germany's economy was crushed and the people lived in poverty, which allowed Hitler to come into power with the NAZI party.Just like how the US is now meddling with middle-eastern countries that had nothing to do with 9/11 attacks. A small group of rogue idiots attacks the US and the response is to mount a full fledged assault on the country they live in? That'd be like like killing everyone in Colorado because the Columbine kids were from there. It's fucking retarded.You just got to love these FOX news zombies.

c9ja8zo,Dave1962,"1) Because you're a collectivist.2) There you go splitting hairs again; all communist countries are dictatorships, since somebody has to be in charge of deciding whose needs get met first. Unanimity democracy is completely different than consensus democracy...but technically it's still a democracy, right?3) You can't name one single monopoly that has ever come into existence without governmental assistance. In a laissez faire system there are no barriers of entry for new companies to enter a market and compete with established ones. Only governmental regulations can change this in order to favor one company over another. 4) So, you're saying that the world should have just let the German's win the first world war? Since we didn't, it's our fault WWII took place?5) Ad hominem attacks are the first indication that you have no logical argument."

Improve healthcare, improve education, raise the poverty line, etc.And the biggest problem of all: ""America"" is not the will of the people. Most of the time, it's a small group of fucking idiots who shout the loudest and push the people with brains out of the decision making process.America has some smart minds, yet they stay out of places they're needed the most.And 90% of the time, people don't act. They sit there and complain and rant about how somebody should do something about it, and never seem to realize that it's them that should be doing something about it. Which, in turn, makes them enablers of sorts.I'm simply responding to your original comment, which I asked proof of, and was given an answer that didn't answer anything.It's like if you said ""Burger King is the best"" and I asked you ""Why?"" and you said ""Because it has bread"".There are millions of restaurants that utilize bread, so that isn't a reason why Burger King is the best.You being able to express your opinion is not proof that America has more positive than negative influence on the world.That's all, I'm out, I realize I was more hostile than what was required of me in my earlier comments, which will result in my words being pushed aside as ""I hate America"" speech, buuut what's been done has been done."
c9gwt0p,chavous,Wouldn't want to live anywhere else buddy. I love my country. I mourn for every innocent person who dies. Doesn't matter what nationality. But America does great things too. I guarantee we feed and save more Africans than we accidentally kill an innocent human on a daily basis.

It's a whole different perspective and many of the reasons people are dying over their is because of their government not protecting them enough.

c9gracc,that_guy_007,"Well, if you were an informed citizen I'd imagine that you'd understand the media's and America's xenophobia which leads to uninformed and completely wrong opinions like your own. If you followed the news coverage of the Colorado and Newton shootings then you would have noticed the media's inclination to blame Muslims for these terrorist attacks on American soil. However, this was quickly dispelled once facts revealed the identity of the shooters to be white American's (not Muslims). Yesterday, it happened again. The media implied that Muslims were behind the attack even though they had no evidence to support their claims...just like you. And I'm not blaming gun owners; I'm making the connection that the people who were originally blamed for the shootings were terrorists, and therefore Muslim, but to most people's surprise were white men."

c9gsysa,sleet01,"It is a sentence, and if you can't parse it then that is on you.What I am saying is that you are a ridiculous person because you have only read one quotation from the article and went off on what you had simply inferred from that one quotation, then insulted me when I called you on that. Nobody, not any liberal, not the article itself, has said or even thought what you're imputing here. That's another thing that makes you ridiculous - that is, worthy of ridicule (since I'm concerned you may not understand long words like that I am including the definition for you).What I, and the article, said is that people whose neighbors and families are blown apart by American weapons in far-away countries feel the same emotions that we Americans are feeling right now: grief, despair, and yes, rage. The typical American response is that the *intent* was different so the response should be different, but these emotions know nothing of intent... only of loss.Of course, idiots like yourself must immediately take any such message as a personal attack because you are addicted to fury. Have fun with your heart attack!Spoiler: that's not the headline of the article, it's the *title* of a *post* that is a *quotation* from the linked article. Now you know."
c9gtck9,pinkocommie,"It clearly was an attack. The initial attack was an attack on the America by the muslim terrorists of the Middle-east. Then the follow-up attack was the moral-equivalency argument that liberal douchebags like you love to wallow in. Because we use drones to kill terrorists in the deserts of the middle east, somehow you equate that to blowing away innocent citizens, including an 8 year old boy. You're a fucking liberal douchebag that loves Obama. Suck it douchebag. Guess what? No one wants to hear about Sandy Hook anymore dillhole.

You already admitted you didn't even bother to read the article. Like most conservatives do, you made a snap decision about the content of the article and just went off on a tirade without any deeper understanding of the text. Then you flipped out when I pointed that out. What'd you expect, upvotes for days? You're pathetic, and your posts are pathetic, and that's why you're getting downvotes.The comparison that was made in the article was that people who lose their loved ones to violence feel similar emotions, regardless of how those loved ones were killed or what the ultimate intent of the attack was. If you can't understand this simple point, well, I'd say it leads me more to toward the second possibility above.Finally, I highly doubt that you actually know what ""moral equivalency"" actual means, but even if you do, you haven't used it correctly here. Maybe you should go back to watching Fox News and drinking Schlitz."
c9gp7y0,froggymike,"I would bet money that it is domestic. Although the attack seems basic, the amount of planning that was needed to pull this off would require a so much communication on behalf of foreign bad guys that shit-storm alarms would be blaring in every CIA office around the world. Also, it can be reasonably assumed that some one would have claimed responsibility by now and given that even the Pakistani Taliban are pussying out for fear of a sudden increase in their monthly ration of airborne freedom, I hypothesize it was domestic. The only problem now is that given there were no declarations made by the perpetrator(s), it is clear they wish to stay free (prioritizing their future moves over their ""message""/ fame) to probably strike again."
c9gpoqj,fyberoptyk,"It happened on tax day. Id be surprised if it DOESN'T turn out to be domestic, honestly."
c9gq9ra,froggymike,Given the whole importance of Boston and the tea party it's plausible. Do you think there would be some claim on behalf of the perpetrators?
c9gqdxv,fyberoptyk,"Not sure. I would EXPECT it, but not until they are either in custody, or until they reach someplace they think they're safe.Of course, it's very likely the police or government have received a claim of responsibility already, and they're keeping it under wraps for now because they think it'll benefit the investigation somehow."
c9gqvt5,froggymike,Makes sense to me. It will be interesting to see if any message/tape comes out in the next couple of days. I was listening to a guy from the ATF and he was listing off the possibilities if it was domestic. He mentioned that it could be a grudge against mayor Menino. He then talked about the possibility of a serial killer and that the longer we went with out a claim about the attack the more realistic the threat became.

And I think, whether or not the article really gets at it, that forums through which violence is discussed often revolve around stories of those who we can empathize with.

Just as I feel when I read about civilian casualties caused by American forces in numerous wars throughout the Middle East. While I might not agree that this would be the wisest time to bring up the issue, OP has clearly done so already. That said, I find it a little appalling that more than half the comments on this post seem to completely disregard the latter point, hell, some even try to justify casualties in Middle East as just ""more terrorists."" If you are really the greatest country in the world you would have some empathy for the innocent people who are just like the victims of the bombing, killed and maimed by people they consider their enemies. You did fire bomb Dresden and nuke Nagasaki and Hiroshima in WW2, there's no reason to believe that your army is perfect in their efforts to reduce civilian casualties."
c9gqah2,pseudotensor,"Nobody seems yet to point out that quite generally there is always a moral ambiguity never a moral absolute. His point of view makes sense for a non-US person or someone fed-up with state-authorized murder. Many of those who felt negatively about what he said would cite how murdering innocents is different (false equivalence) than those in a war zone and similar arguments, which he could say is just a false dichotomy because murder is murder and it's just that you got sucked into the US definition of what's right and wrong using labels associated with terrorist vs. innocent or war vs. peace.One way to view people's views is by their patriotism. Certainly a US patriot will always see US policy and security above even non-US lives. On the other end of the spectrum is an anti-US terrorist or state, who views US policy and its selfish patriotism as hurting the entire world and driving it farther from world peace for its own selfish temporary wants.All these views are more or less correct, and the moral ambiguity is only resolved by choice and perspective. In the US we have chosen (either directly or indirectly through our continued republic democracy) certain moral truths that are quite selfish, but from a US person my perspective is also quite selfish and I somehow agree that some of the ""bad"" things the US does is ok, although many things they do are not ok to me.But living in the US as a representative democracy, I have no fine-grained control over those things. I wish I did."

Bad PR in the right communities caused by whats deemed effective will influence what will be deemed effective. I suspect that the social media will change the wargame in an unimaginable sense if they stay unregulated. Especially in the developing world. Imagine, hundreds of millions of cameras in the hands of the lower classes in africa and asia. Every local community will be globally connected. Would our capacity for empathy be saturated to the point of lethargy because of this? In the same way that terrorism acts inside of the arabic countries have? In the same way Wikileaks passed from the public eye? I hope not. The user HilariousMax have been saturated. He realises that his concern is better placed in his community. He is lethargic in the face of overwhelming news which he feels unable to influence. Perhaps this means that local problems will be solved by local communities. Communities that are better informed than before. Waffles81 are still concerned. I fear that his concern will also saturate over time. Perhaps this means that foreign Communities will help the local communities for a short time in the face of disaster; such as the haitian earthquakes. I'm afraid that the world will slowly turn into a global version of stuebenville in the years to come. We will soon have information on an extreme amount of despicable acts.

When America consistently re-elects presidents who fight wars abroad, even wars as cynical as Vietnam or Iraq, especially when involving weapons such as napalm, agent orange, cluster bombs, or tactics like shock and awe, it gives the strong impression that the American public supports these wars and does not care about the civilian cost. That's not to say America is alone in this - it was the same thing when Blair was re-elected in 2005.You don't have to support it, but you do have to put yourself in the shoes of Iraqis who have had innocent family members killed, abducted and tortured in the hunt for non-existent weapons of mass destruction, only to have the general public in America and UK give their consent for this at the ballot box."

c9ha7i5,mcivor_1,No because if it gets Americans to look at their foreign policy and recent history of it then they would come to see how deceitful their government has been to their nation. After realising this I'm sure the more politically aware and humane of the Americans would also then take a closer look at their domestic policies and would also not like what they find. If enough Americans did as described above then they have the future of their country in their hands as it is the government that is supposed to serve the people in the peoples best interests not vice-versa and it is only the people that government should be accountable to. Therefore either way if it was domestic or foreign terrorist more Americans are aware of their governments actions and its within their power to change that for the better in the future. Also if this bombing was not done by muslim extremists i don't think the people of the middle east would mind the US reviewing and changing their policy in the middle east as they have lost many civilians in the last 10 years to American forces.

And I should mention, the son, as was the father, was a US citizen.And what about double tapping techniques during drone strike sweeps? Imagine the Boston bombing being the result of a drone strike.

c9gu6ax,,"You're calling me dumb for not accepting that the US intentionally targets the civilians. What you still don't seem to get is that the civilians aren't the target, the terrorist amongst them is. Your assertion that there is ""no evidence"" that they are bombing terrorists is absolutely wrong. They target specific places BECAUSE THEY HAVE A TARGET THERE. They don't do it to randomly kill, but to kill specific targets IN THE PLACES THEY ARE BOMBING. You clearly took nothing away from the article, and you disturbingly believe that the US government uses drones to randomly bomb civilian targets. I promise you that you cannot find me a single occasion where a predator drone fired a missile that was not aimed at a specific target. Like I said, I DO NOT DENY THAT CIVILIANS ARE KILLED. DO YOU KNOW THE DEFINITION OF COLLATERAL DAMAGE? I said, they aren't the targets, the HVT nearby IS. You don't even understand the military or the application of predator drones."
c9gubko,,"I realize now that I'm arguing with someone who legitimately believes that the US uses drone strikes against unknown targets or targets that are not suspected of containing a legitimate terrorist threat. This is largely false. I don't know where you got your information that the drone strikes are not against legitimate terrorist figures, but you are wrong. For the last time, I understand and disapprove of any civilians killed as collateral damage by these strikes. But you are simply wrong if you believe that the civilians themselves, and not the terrorist leaders/targets in the vicinity, are the targets. Furthermore, you won't get anywhere with your ""dumb brainwashed American"" argument. It's as flimsy and childish as your writing ability."
c9gtbmf,GoodOnYouOnAccident,Oh fuck this bullshit. Seriously.
c9gth47,Chir0nex,"The author misses a single fundamental difference in that the U.S military does not target large gathering of civilians, celebrating a holiday, with the purpose of causing terror or civilian death alone. However reprehensible military actions may be, they are intended to be directed at other military or paramilitary elements. What happened in Boston, in my city where I grew up and have lived my entire life, cannot be considered the same. Don't try and make me feel guilty about how I am feeling right now by implying that I do not care about people in other countries. Of course I care about what the military does, but it is absurd to think that I will react the same way to that as to an explosion in my backyard. There is a time a to debate foreign policy and american values, but barely a day after this tragedy is not it."
c9gtss6,Thebluecane,"This is absolutely insane. The guys ""proof"" that the US targets first responders cones from a single article on a site I have never heard of. Now I understand the reaction of certain redditors is to push awareness of political ideals even using something like this immediately after it with no shame to remind everyone that the US isn't perfect.Seriously get off your high horse no person seriously thinks the US is blameless but there is a huge difference between the US attacking military combatants (and if that ""report"" is to be believed first responders who are affiliated with these combatants) and some coward trying to inflict massive civilian casualties. To compare these two actions only shows a desire to grind an ideological axe and no sympathy for the victims of this tragedy"
c9gvucw,cyphadz,"hmm.. wasnt there an american military helo attacking 1st responders in Iraq innocent man w/ his kids prob on his way home stop assist wounded and what did the recording quote the pilot saying ""he shouldnt have brought his children to a war zone"" a video posted by wikileaks ..and what about Blackwaters helo shooting up an entire city block and the 1st responders that show up to offer help ...nope we certainly don't do that!"
c9gvwwc,Thebluecane,Yep 2 examples in a 10 year war of people losing their shit guess what it isn't pretty but it happens. As opposed to the constant stream of suicide bombings and shit targeting civilians. The US isn't innocent but no country is.

Whether you agree with what we're doing or not, the US is trying to do good. Someone I know from Afghanistan told me how much better it is there since we got rid of the Taliban control, and most citizens are thankful for what we're trying to do, or at least understand. I guess all the money we've given trying to fund schools and educate citizens is because we don't care."

And sometimes you could argue that we support them because it benefits us. But America definitely has a catch 22. We're expected to police the world. If we don't we're asked how can we be letting this happen, and of we do we're heavily criticized. But I think for the most part we believe we're doing the right thing. It's very complicated to juggle relationships while trying to police the world. Either way, it's ridiculous to say we were ever anywhere to purposely harm citizens."

But none of this even matter because America has never purposely killed civilians. Also Iraq is the worst example and by far our biggest mistake, we thought it was in and out.

c9gwdky,adrianmonk,"I'm sorry, I cannot agree with his point #1.OK, yes, the US does ""double tap"" targeting of rescuers and mourners of drone strikes. Yes, the US is being pretty damn sloppy about possibly killing innocent people. Yes, I can understand his outrage about this.But he is equating it to what happened at the Boston marathon yesterday, as if they are exactly the same thing ('exactly the kinds of ... attacks that the US has been bringing', '""double-tap"" attacks is precisely what the US now does').That I can't agree with. The primary targets at the Boston marathon were *known* to be innocent. The first responders were *known* to be innocent. There is *no reasonable case at all*, not even a hint of a reason to suspect, that any of them did anything wrong or associated with anyone who did anything wrong.In a US drone strike, the targets are *believed* to be guilty, even if it may be based on shady evidence, even if someone is just taking their best guess. And there is at least a rational basis to believe the people who try to rescue them or who mourn them *might* be their associates.Is it morally OK to take out some people who you aren't sure are guilty in order to get someone you really believe is? It's pretty questionable. **But at least it's questionable**. The attacks yesterday were aimed, knowingly, at 100% innocent, 100% civilians. That's not questionable morally. That's unquestionably immoral.To me, that's a pretty big difference. I'm not trying to take away from the strong suspicion that should aimed at the US drone program, but it serves no purpose to equate two things which aren't even in the same league morally."
c9gwf6k,momzill,"> but it serves no purpose to equate two things which aren't even in the same league morally.I see your point and it is a valid one, but as a parent, from an emotional standpoint, my child being hurt/disabled/killed - yeah, it is equal - the result is the same."
c9gx91g,Tychonaut,"Yeah, I think ""on the ground"" there is a difference. I don't think an individual soldier is equatable with a terrorist (although I'm sure that not all ""terrorists"" have identical moral compasses either).

c9gpxv8,independentlythought,"I think there's a clear difference in the U.S. accidentally, albeit frequently, killing civilians and terrorists intentionally slaughtering masses of innocent people. Honestly, this is really the argument I make when we look at how our government operates. America does stupid stuff- let's face it. We illegally tortured people after 9/11, we passed the Patriot Act, we screwed the Middle East several times over, and essentially pissed off the entire world. But I do not think that government officials did this out of malevolence or love for violence and oppression. I think that because of of the rights and wrongs that Western society teaches us, people in the government do not want to cause evil and tragedy across the world. They probably just want to do what is in the interests of the nation, because indirectly, that benefits them come election time. I know that there are tons of politicians and government officials who are low-life, self-serving, evil scumbags. But I do think that as far as the military and departments go that they are not trying to kill innocent people.With that being said, the motives that Al Qaeda operates behind are indisputable. We were attacked on 9/11, and most likely yesterday, for one reason and one reason only: America intervenes in the Middle East. I don't think we understand that these people see Saudi Arabia and the Arab geopolitical world as their holy land. When we start basing F-15s and tanks out of there, it's bound to most certainly piss them off. The best thing we can do is just stay out of the whole region. Keeping oil at 100 dollars a barrel is not worth thousands of American lives and the loss of civil liberties.

The thing is, no point about the misbehavior of the US government will excuse the heinous act of placing a large pipe-bomb in a crowd gathered in a large city with the intent to kill and maim innocent people, and neither does the country they were in, nor the relative number of people hurt.

(If you wanted to know how dumb it was like, just imagine the Sri Lanka govt advising the Bush govt that they should get down to peace negotiations with the AL quaeda after 9/11) Later when Sri Lanka decided enough is enough and the terrorists were on the verge of annihilation, who steps in, but Uncle Sam to save the LTTE terrorist leader Prabhakaran from a certain death. By some luck Sri Lanka manage to completely eradicate terrorism from its shores, despite all the covert backing these terrorists received from US and its European allies. However even todate Sri Lanka is hounded by US for phony ""war crimes"" charges, and the relationship between a once very US friendly nation Sri Lanka and US has hit rock bottom.

c9guvm0,,Depends on the definition of terrorism you use in your analysis. The US has dozens of definitions depending on which branch of the state is involved. Also many major international institutions do not incorporate the intent to cause terror in definitions of terrorism as it is too restrictive. The intentional killing of civilians/innocents/non-combatants (depending on definition) is enough to brand the US state guilty of acts of terrorism at the least historically (my country GB too) not pointing fingers just saying don't pretend there is a simple one size fits all definition there isn't and not should there be.

Maybe these mentalities are not as 'extreme' here in Europe as they are in the US, but they are definitely common. Also it's not only the US bombing targets in the Middle East, but their allies aswell. Given, our soldiers are there mainly as a result of US actions and we 'only' fulfill our duties as NATO partners, but we should not forget that our armies are in Afghanistan also, because we as Europeans have (economical) interests in this part of the world, and, at least German soldiers (and again, I think it's safe to say this also applies for British, Canadian, Dutch, Australian, French and all NATO troops), made terrible mistakes over the years aswell. Imo, we are all in the same boat and the constant pointing fingers on the US is starting to feel creepy as we seem to hide and belittle our own involvement, sentiments and mistakes behind those made by the US.

These are exactly the kinds of horrific, civilian-slaughtering attacks that the US has been bringing to countries in the Muslim world over and over and over again for the last decade, with very little attention paid.I had to stop reading at this point. This guy is full of shit.There IS grief and outrage over the innocent lives being lost in the middle east, ESPECIALLY when its our own government that did it. Look at how much attention Bradly Manning got, look how much support he has from the public. Look how viral that video of OUR GUYS shooting a camera crew went.This idea that we just don't care is complete horse shit and I think everyone here knows it. Who here doesn't think about such a thing daily? I sure as hell do, whether I want to or not.So not only do we have the grief and frustration with Boston's attack to deal with, but it IS compounded on top of the grief and sorrow we feel for the innocent lives lost to war in the middle east. What a ridiculous sensationalized guilt trip."

Look at how ridiculous and cruel that connotation is : that the tube bombings were moral karma for supporting israel at its inception. thats what the article is implying, that this is pay back for the drone wars. Its also assuming that most people in the USA are up in arms about muslims. Thats not the case at all. every single person I talk to here in the deep South, the heartland of the ubiquitous racist hick, thinks its a domestic terrorist. Why? Because of April 15th being the deadline for every single person in america's taxes to be paid and it being patriot day in boston, the day that the first shot of the Revolution was fired. Boston has a lot of the symbols some extremist american domestic groups want to attack or attach themselves to. the article has a main point that we need to realize the civilian cost of our war.

There is a big difference between an intentional attack on innocents and collateral damage as a result of going after one's enemies. Intent. There is also a big difference in the location in which these events happened. It is much less shocking when loss of life occurs in a war zone than when it happens in the middle of a peaceful area with no immanent threat of danger. With the first, there is a known risk. The loss of life of civilians is in other countries is just as tragic as the loss of life here and I do sympathize with the people affected there and much as here. However, it is irresponsible and illogical to try to compare the two types of events. Anyone who does this is just trying to stir up conflict and should just keep their mouth shut."

It's a strategy that is meant to target the family and acquaintances of accused terrorists and it is a strategy currently being used by the US military in countries like Yemen and Pakistan. Innocent civilians are targeted and killed almost every time.

When rescuers rushed to the scene, 2 more struck, killing 8 (Pakistan)Jan 6, 2010: Shortly after the first strike, as the rescue efforts were underway, the death toll rose to 15 (Pakistan)Im certainly no left wing anti war pinko but there is a large amount of evidence the US is conducting these 'double tap' drone strikes."

Second, anyone who can be honest with themselves would realize that someday that these type of attacks would probably happen here, mainly due to the various military operations/incursions that the U.S. is responsible for in the last 10-15 years, it finally hit home for me when i saw a cartoon about soccer several months back, no country wanted to play this one certain country and when they asked it the U.S. wanted to play, we were represented by a soldier behind a barbed wire barricade, which is how much of the world tends to see the U.S. nowadays, as a militaristic force, not as a democratic force for good, just the biggest bully in the local neighborhood!

The fact that we are still able to feel sadness and anger over this just drives home the point that we put ourselves much higher than everyone else. It is still '*us* vs. *them*'.This event definitely warrants sadness, cooperation, regrouping, and investigation, but for a populace that ignores the fact this is common in other parts of the world because of our fellow countrymen, perhaps we don't deserve that chance to recuperate. Needless to say, we *will* continue to stand and push onward.While the author of this article does come off like a bit of a prick, I hope this event opens some eyes for the people in the US. May we someday fight for freedom once more and reach out to the world with compassion, not greed."
c9gsytx,floridawhiteguy,"Not a surprise seeing such ultra-left-wing bleeding-heart propaganda from Glenn Greenwald. I guess he's now America's Piers Morgan.When the US military kills innocents, it has almost always been because the intended target was using them as human shields - often with the consent and aid of the human shields. The US military makes extraordinary effort to ensure their intelligence is solid and actionable before they even plan a mission, much less pulls a trigger. They don't target innocents - they do their damnedest to avoid them.When terrorists attack innocent civilians, the goal isn't justice or revenge - it's ego stroking. It's about making themselves feel good about being able to control people through fear. They attack innocents because going after military targets is just too difficult.Greenwald knows all of this, but instead he verbally prances around pointing out the sins of racial and political injustice he feels are more damning than murder and mayhem. He is a fool pandering to like-minded idiots."

They could be sneaking a new law in right under our noses and we wouldn't know. I really hope the past 12 years of the 'terrorist' fad don't repeat themselves either.

c9h69ro,rockidol,"Do you not understand the difference between intentionally targeting innocent civilians, and having innocent civilians die as accidental casualties in a war?Because basically every war has civilian casualties. You don't think a few German civilians died when Allied forces were bombing Berlin at the end of WWII?Were we all evil then or is it suddenly evil now?"
c9h7nux,jdkeith,"To be fair, anyone who died at The Pentagon on 9/11 was a either a legitimate military target or a civilian casualty. So there's that."
c9h86bb,rockidol,>was a either a legitimate military target or a civilian casualty. Is there a 3rd category?The Pentagon was a legit military target but their method of attacking it was one that guaranteed unnecessary civilian casualties (the ones in the plane). Although maybe if they had kicked them out at the runway they wouldn't have been able to leave the airport.Either way they also attacked the WTC which is not a military target.
c9h8b38,jdkeith,"Right. The WTC wasn't a military target, nor were the planes used valid ordinance. Let's say they only attacked the WTC and without a plane, if they at least tried to keep civvy deaths to a minimum given what they had access to, I think that'd be on par with what the U.S. does.Bear in mind the U.S. military as an institution doesn't care about civilians per se. They care about PR because that's important for war nowadays. They don't outlaw chemical weapons because they're widely dangerous (unlike nuclear or biological), but because they want war to be a rich country's game."
c9h8hkf,rockidol,">Let's say they only attacked the WTC and without a plane, if they at least tried to keep civvy deaths to a minimum given what they had access toWait if they didn't want to kill civilians then why attack the WTC at all? We bomb buildings to kill people in Al Quadea. If they were hiding in a skyscraper I think (hope) we would wait until they're in a much smaller building or something.But we all know the 9/11 guys were targeting civilians, so I don't see the point of this thought experiment. At least when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor they specifically avoided hospitals."

c9gw87o,crasspy,"Well, I am not buying into the argument going back and forth in this thread. But you asked about where the US purposely killed civilians...well, I can literally think of dozens of examples off my head where civilians were either directly or incidentally the primary targets. Dropping two nuclear bombs on cities (which by definition are largely civilian targets) knowing that tens of thousands of civilians. Then there's the fire bombing of Tokyo. That killed around 100,000 people - mostly civilians. Like I say, I am not buying into the argument - but I am seriously shocked that people think the US history is pristine. It's not."
c9hm2wb,POGTFO,"I'm not saying U.S. history is ""pristine."" You don't even have to look at our foreign policy to know that, just look at our domestic issues throughout history. The argument could be made that the atom bombs from WWII actually saved lives - and if not an overall total of lives, it certainly saved American lives (which, when you're at war with another country, it's understandable that saving your own citizens lives is a priority...). Personally, I feel that dropping two bombs, as opposed to one, was a mistake - yet, I wouldn't equate dropping either to a terrorist attack that is aimed solely at killing civilians, for nothing more than the purpose of killing civilians."

c9gy7u9,Piccolo60000,"Seriously now, what is the value in attacking a civilian target? What is the tactical value? None. The US wouldn't intentionally target civilians because it doesn't make any logical sense. I've tired of the attack on Boston being compared to the drone strikes or any other action America has done in the Middle East. You can't even mention them in the same breath. Why? Because the Middle East is a fucking war zone, Boston is not. As sad as it is, civilians in war zones tend to get caught up in the crossfire and get injured or die. It happens. Deal with it. It certainly doesn't help when the actual targets of the attacks are hiding out amongst the population. If anything, blame the civilians for staying in and keeping their children in a fucking war zone! If your city turned into a war zone, would you keep your family there? Fuck no!In all honesty, while the loss of innocent life is regrettable, at the end of the day those people chose to stay in a war zone. They know bad shit is gonna happen but yet they stay. They knew the risks in staying there. As much as I love my city, if it turned into a war zone you bet your ass I'd be out of there."

Further more people tend to forget that America is a SUPER power nation. We have impact in the world. It's not just ego, that's a fact.

The rest of the world would be in an even bigger shithole if it wasn't for the US. That's a fact. Does the US do everything right and make all the right decisions? Absolutely not.

Hey buddy, I'm an American too, but unlike you, I'm not completely oblivious to the way we take advantage of other nations.We choose sides in wars in other nations, often not based on what is right, but rather on what is right FOR US.We exploit cheap labor in other nations, paying Chinese people who send every penny home to their poor relatives, so little to assemble our iPhones, and working them so hard, that they commit suicide. We allow corporations to purchase goods from those who use child labor. Their rivers are poisoned from all the chemicals being dumped into them by corporations trying to make goods as cheaply as possible.Mexicans? We allow them to come into our nation to pick fruit, (81% of our farm labor is composed of migrant workers) and we expect them to pay taxes (income and social security), yet they do not get many of the benefits of those taxes, they don't get to vote, and we don't let them become citizens.Maybe the rest of the world would be an even bigger shithole without the US. But without the rest of the world, the US wouldn't be a superpower. If the rest of the world stopped selling us cheap manufactured goods and stopped picking our fruits and vegetables, we'd be fucked. We have no manufacturing here anymore. And 12% of our farm labor is paid less than minimum wage, and you're not going to find enough americans willing to pick fruit in the hot sun all day for minimum wage to make up the slack if all the undocumented workers didn't show up one day. So the price of all your food would double. You really haven't got a fucking clue."

Those people don't deserve this, regardless of what has happened/is happening overseas. They didn't ask for it, they weren't plotting ways of harming innocent people in a foreign country. More likely they were thinking about their loved ones in the race, grocery lists, and many other harmless topics.

c9gt1w1,phil08,"This is just the way humanity works unfortunately. What the writer speaks is the truth, but he has seemingly gone about it in a contradicting manner. How can you talk about the empathy of the American people and who they've attacked and killed without you, yourself, sounding like a nationalist/regionalist also. Now I could reference the map you may have seen recently on the front page depicting all of the countries Great Britain hasn't invaded and blah blah blah, but then I would only be conveying the same message as the person who wrote this and that is not what I am here to do. You see a long time ago it was specieism (Homo Neanderthal vs. Homo Sapien) just yesterday it was racism, today it's nationalism/regionalism and tomorrow it will be globalism, assuming we ever achieve colonization of another planet or interstellar travel in which to do so. And mind you we are still in a big transition period between this whole racism thing and nationalism/regionalism. It could also be that the two are deeply intertwined, in which, neither one will prevail over the other until the age of our civilization brings about a change in that altogether. Me personally, I live in my own little ""bubble"" if you will, as do the rest of us, limited only by how much knowledge we can/choose to intake at any particular given time . I don't actively pursue information of this type (what the human race is doing to itself, in this manner), nor do I personally condone what my nation is doing (since I was never personally consulted on anything my country does without my knowledge, i guess), its just that I don't know about it, and it's not that I don't care or don't want to know, its just like I said before, I don't actively pursue this type of information, but if presented to me will be taken in to thought and consideration. I just feel as if my focus is best used on other types of information, but that's not to say that none of this is factored in. Deep down we know ""what's up"" (left to the human imagination of course, but you at least have an idea/concept) even if we don't know or read about it, and its not that we choose to ignore it, it just gets pushed back on the list our minds prioritize for us and its just as though we seem to think that there are more important things than this logically. No persons priorities are the same but I feel as if this would be the general underlying consensus. Don't get me wrong, if I could change the way humanity thinks/acts, I would for the better (but then who am I to know whats ""better"" for humanity?), but no one person ever could I think. It would require a group of people to do so and in groups you almost always have corruption and so I think that that wouldn't work either. So in closing I regress back to my original statement. This is just the way things are. By no means am I saying ""life isn't fair"", but what happens to things you cannot change? You either die trying to change them, or adapt and come to terms, and I respect both of those outcomes whichever you may choose."

He doesn't call Americans cold hearted, He's just saying that you don't care (or don't want to admit) that your own country is doing the same thing to others on a regular basis. And of course that you are a quite narrowminded to blame muslims as soon as something bad happens.I guess you haven't read the article so please take a look at just a fragment off it.""One continually encountered yesterday expressions of dread and fear from Arabs and Muslims around the world that the attacker would be either or both. That's because they know that all members of their religious or ethnic group will be blamed, or worse, if that turns out to be the case. That's true even though leading Muslim-American groups such as CAIR harshly condemned the attack (as they always do) and urged support for the victims, including blood donations. One tweeter, referencing the earthquake that hit Iran this morning, satirized this collective mindset by writing: ""Please don't be a Muslim plate tectonic activity.""""Does this sound like gratitude to you or is it perhaps fear?"

Think of it this way, would you have preferred the US not have used the two atomic bombs in WWII? These bombings resulted in massive civilian casualties, but the casualties that would have resulted if the bombs had not been dropped would have been much greater. Anytime civilian casualties are a possibility the decision to strike becomes very tricky, but sometimes is necessary.

Since you presume to teach all of the United States about empathy, and wrap all of us here up in your criticism that we lack the quality aforementioned, I will help you spread your message of empathy to those enemies of ours. Here's my offer:1. I buy you a plane ticket to... I don't know... Afghanistan or Iraq?2. I buy you a car and hire you a driver to drive you to the nearest enemy insurgent suspected location.3. You teach them about this specific type of empathy of yours.4. They become peaceful, we withdraw our troops.5. ????6. PROFIT!Mr. Greenwald, you opportunistic bastard."

c9h0roe,DJRES,"Attacks like this seems to create a feeling of community and solidarity for the people involved. Everyone offers sympathy and some even offer actual help, financially or otherwise. For some reason, however, attacks like this cause people like this smug douchenozzle, Glenn, to feel like the people involved somehow deserved it. I hope that one day he or his loved ones catch a face full of ball bearings or get their legs shredded into useless pulp. That way, when he sits behind his desk, writing this horseshit, he can actually be taken seriously."
c9hd1ck,,"And then, when he gets injured by a bomb, you can write an article about how he deserved it because of something he wrote. And then I'll write a comment about how you deserve to be blown up because you said someone else deserved to be blown up. But then I'll deserve to be blown up.Also, he didn't say anyone deserved this in the first place. You're the only one saying anyone deserves a bombing. You're also saying that you hope someone gets shrapnel in the face or their legs blown up because they're related to someone with a controversial opinion."
c9hdgxs,DJRES,"No, I'm not. The title of this post says pretty explicitly that anger felt because of this incident is unjustified because 'we' have done the same thing to everyone else. That's absolute bullshit. Your slippery slope fallacy aside, I'm saying that this asscrack has no ground to stand on when writing this nonsense. Maybe if he had some **first hand** experience dealing with something like this, he could be taken more seriously and not be written off as a desk bitch using a tragic event to get website hits. Although, had he any first hand experience I'd be willing to wager that he'd be singing a different tune in his editorial column. I'm an American. I have friends in Boston. I also had absolutely nothing to do with wartime collateral damage in countries that politicians decide are valid targets. Why is my anger unjustified?"
c9he0tr,,"> The title of this post says pretty explicitly that anger felt because of this incident is unjustified because 'we' have done the same thing to everyone else.It is provably false that this has been stated ""explicitly"" in the article. Whether or not it says so implicitly is theoretically debatable, although I would argue that you are grossly misinterpreting article if that is your understanding of it.> Your slippery slope fallacy aside,What slippery slope fallacy? I'm trying to point out the hypocrisy of saying that the author deserves to be maimed by a bomb because he says that others deserve to be maimed by a bomb (which he didn't even say).> Why is my anger unjustified? No one is saying your anger is unjustified. In any case, don't criticize the author's argument in a response to mine. While I agree with the author's point, I wasn't defending it in my reply to you.I was making three points. None of which you addressed other than to say> No, I'm not.which is hardly a counter-argument.The first was that you're being hypocritical. You criticize the author for suggesting that the people involved deserved what they got. You seem to think that the author is saying is that, since Americans have caused suffering to foreigners, they deserve to experience suffering themselves. You go on to imply that, for holding this point of view, the author deserves for> he or his loved ones catch a face full of ball bearings or get their legs shredded into useless pulp.My second point was that he never made the argument that you think he made. He never said that anyone deserved this.My third point was that what you are implicitly arguing for is far more disturbing that what you *think* the author is arguing. You want someone to> catch a face full of ball bearings or get their legs shredded into useless pulp.because they are *related* to someone with whom you disagree."
c9hegmb,DJRES,"So aside from calling me out on semantics, you didn't actually say how you interpreted this twat's article. Secondly, I didn't say that I hope they catch a face full of ball bearings or get their legs shredded into useless pulp because they are related to him. I said that I hope that he can experience something similar himself so when he writes something like this, it is based in actuality. He writes inflammatory, pedantic, editorial nonsense and has absolutely no ground on which base it. Reading the article, I get the sense that he wrote solely for the purpose of getting views. Insensitive is the nicest word I can think of for people who use an incident like this as a platform to spew political vitriol. Its like the gun nuts and their opponents after school shootings."
c9hffcz,,"> you didn't actually say how you interpreted this twat's article.I quite clearly implied that I interpreted the article to not be saying that anyone deserved what happened.> I didn't say that I hope they catch a face full of ball bearings or get their legs shredded into useless pulp because they are related to him.You did here:> I hope that one day he or his loved ones catch a face full of ball bearings or get their legs shredded into useless pulp.I understand that you have a reason for wanting the author to suffer, but what I mean when I say ""because they are related"" is that, if his relative suffers as you wish, it will be because they are related to the author."

c9gysi6,TheMorganFreemanLie,"Most blacks are democrats. Blacks commit more violent crime (by far) than any other group in America.You're literally part of the group which has the MOST violent faction in the US at it's core.Want more? How about someone like Obama obsessed liberal professor Amy Bishop, who went on a spree and killed 3 people at the University of Alabama? Before that she had been a suspect in a mail bomb case (and thus probably did it) and years before that she had 'accidently' shot her brother to death.Do you know WHY you don't hear about people like Amy Bishop? Because the liberal news media covers up such stories to the best of its ability. How about Kermit Gosnell, the abortion doctor in pennsylvania who has apparently killed at least seven babies born alive and a patient? The liberal media is outright ignoring this case and it is VERY current. How about Radford University criminal justice professor (noticing a theme here with the liberal professors?) Raj Mahon-Haft didn't directly commit violence, but it might not have been far off, he was a druggie with a childporn habit, arrested 3 times in one month alone for that shit. (how you can be arrest for child porn and them let you out is beyond me).In short liberals are distorted, evil people, the left wing media simply covers it up."
