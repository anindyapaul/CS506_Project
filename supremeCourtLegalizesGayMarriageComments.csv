csjf5ic,WRCousCous,"One of the most interesting sentences to me, and one that holds great logical and philosophical (and clearly legal) weight:> Precedent protects the right of a married couple not to procreate, so the right to marry cannot be conditioned on the capacity or commitment to procreate.The last sentence on page 3, from [the PDF of the majority decision published on the SC website](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf)."
csjf9df,Tzukiyomi,"Yup, there had been cases in the past about marriage and infertility."
csjjqpk,sorator,"I think it was specifically marriage and *contraception*, not sure about *infertility*.Same reasoning applies, regardless."
csjl5tt,WRCousCous,"Regardless, what this sentence gets at fundamentally is the quite silly 'biological objection,' which gets bandied about surprisingly often. As a biologist, I'm quite happy to see the SCOTUS coming down like a ton of bricks on crap pseudoscience."
csjlmqx,sorator,"Also really, really nice to see them saying ""yknow what, no, this doesn't mean bad things for kids - *not* deciding this would mean bad things for kids. Cause there are already same-sex couples who have kids, and those kids get to grow up knowing that their parents and families are somehow less than other couples and families. Fuck that."""
csjs25e,ricecake,"Yeah, that made me happy. ""Think of the children!"" ""Ok... Gay marriage is legal, in part to benefit the children of same sex couples"" ""Shit."""
csjm0am,WRCousCous,"If I remember correctly, I also think there are a number of sound scientific studies providing evidence that: a) homosexual couples are more financially stable than heterosexual couples; and recently b) that being raised in homosexual households (ugg, hate that construction) is statistically not different from being raised in hetero-homes in terms of child welfare and wellbeing outcomes.In other words... all the bullshit objections we've heard of late are just that. Bullshit. It's great to see constitutional protection of loving households and stable environments for kids.Cheers!"
csjza1j,,"A few years ago, a study found that the incidence rate of physical abuse in lesbian households was - zero.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/10/lesbians-child-abuse-0-percent_n_781624.html"
csjzruu,WRCousCous,"lol :) Now that's a pretty good effect size, eh?"
csjnp8h,Himtheguy13,Could you ELI5 what this means in regards to contraception and biological objection?
csjs4ng,WRCousCous,"A not infrequent objection to homosexuality (and gay marriage) is that it is unnatural, because it doesn't produce offspring. This despite evidence that being gay has genetic (i.e., pretty damn natural) components, and that most gay people are perfectly capable of reproducing. Behaviors similar to human homosexuality are also not rare in the animal kingdom.In short, the idea that homosexuality is somehow unnatural, and legalizing gay marriage is inadvisable due to *biology*, is pretty foolish and unscientific. Someone can believe that, but the court has now conclusively declared the second part of that thinking to be utter poppycock. Marriage is not for the purpose of procreation, so the inability of two people of the same sex to have natural children (without the aid of surrogates) is not a reason to deny same sex couples the right to marry. Tl;dr: Marriage isn't about procreation, so forbidding same sex couples to marry is no more legal or sensible than refusing married couples contraception or denying marriage licenses to hetero couples that can't naturally reproduce."
csk2w9m,DiogenesLied,When I hear someone pitch the procreation argument I like to ask if they think my marriage should be annulled since my wife and I have no children. Awkward silence or sputtering usually follows.
csjrcf9,bitbybit3,"Precedent also protects the rights of consenting adults to engage in sexual activity, so sexual orientation cannot be the purpose. Since this is about intragender marriage then you can compare it directly to interracial marriage and see that the constitutional protections should be with regard to gender. Precedent gives gender a quasi-suspect classification which is subject to intermediate scrutiny.Even if people wanted this to be strictly about sexual orientation I don't know how anyone can possibly argue that sexual orientation is not a classification that puts people in a likely position of discrimination, and thus how they could be kept from at the very least the quasi-suspect classification (as has been ruled by at least 1 appellate court).Under intermediate scrutiny, there are no *important* government interests that are furthered by banning same-gender marriage.So really, the dissent is baffling."
csjwvrv,H_Ivy,">So really, the dissent is baffling.Is it, though? The people who dissent wouldn't understand most of the words you used in your reasoning."
csjx6kn,fathed,"Are you joking? They aren't as dumb as you think.The dissenting opinion correctly states the courts cannot legislate the law.I'm all for the rights they say we have, the issue is the court doesn't have the right to grant us rights."
csjxa43,H_Ivy,"Actually, they do, thanks to the Fourteenth Amendment. Enjoy.http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3b6zln/supreme_court_legalizes_gay_marriage/csjr03a"
csjxrxx,fathed,"I'm all for the equal protection clause being used, but the courts themselves have limited its use, so its random as to its application, and not truly equal protection.Have you read Marbury vs Madison? It didn't grant the court any rights, it determined that something Congress has said was unconstitutionally expanding the Courts power. There is still only 1 way to get rights in the USA. Amendments."
csk8yqi,bullevard,"One could argue that 'rights' are the natural state of things, and the constitution and the amendments are just buffers against the law impeding on those rights. The court in this case just said 'oops, they had these rights all along and we have just forgotten to let them exercise those rights. We should stop doing that. '"
csk9pzx,fathed,That would actually be mostly correct. See the 9th and 10th.
csjn6j5,mroperator,I feel this would have more upvotes if people understood conditional statements better.
csjr3ps,stefey,"Would really suck for all the infertile married couples in the US, ie anyone over the age of 55. It was a retarded argument to begin with."
csjun6u,jhwyung,Canadian question regarding your legal process:How iron clad is this? Can there be anyway to appeal this or is a supreme court judgment the end all and be all of it?
csjxsxi,tapanther,"The Supreme Court is the court of final appeals (no further appeals are possible), and had the power of judicial review (court judgements override congressional law). There are only two ways to reverse this ruling. Congress and the States can ratify a Constitutional Amendment, which would become the Supreme law of the land. The other option is for a future Supreme Court ruling to overturn this one, just as this ruling overturned the Bowers decision.The former is nearly impossible, as it requires 2/3rds majority in the Senate and the House, AND 3/4ths of the States to ratify. Alternatively, 2/3rds of States can call for a Constitutional Convention, but that has never happened, as it is a terrifying concept. The latter wouldn't happen soon, as the Court wouldn't reverse itself unless there's a drastic change in the makeup of the Court, and even then the Court is supposed to uphold previous rulings unless there is a very pressing reason to change them. Edit: spelling"
csjxf1c,WRCousCous,"It is *practically* unassailable, but theoretically it can be overturned. A future Supreme Court decision could overturn this (US law is sort of eternally fluid in that sense), or through a rather tortuous process an Amendment to the Constitution prohibiting gay marriage could be passed. For all practical purposes, this is the end all and be all on this issue (strictly, can gay couples be married)."
csjrh6h,kyrsjo,"Uh, has there been a court case in the US about married couples refusing to procreate? Who is suing? Their parents?"
csjsgnl,WRCousCous,"There has indeed been such a case (more than one, I strongly suspect). [Griswold from 1965 is the best example](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/381/479.html) (SCOTUS), and the state of Connecticut filled the ""parental"" role of your question."
csjtucy,kyrsjo,"*cringe*A bit more readable summary:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griswold_v._ConnecticutTL;DR: Apparently contraception was *forbidden*:""""""The law made it illegal to use of ""any drug, medicinal article, or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception(...)” and subject to be “(...) fined not less than fifty dollars or imprisoned not less than sixty days nor more than one year or be both fined and imprisoned.""[1]""""""This ban was overturned by the court case you found.I wonder how anyone could come up with a law like that?"
csju1xp,WRCousCous,"Bad biology, failure to see C & E as fundamentally separate, overly generous assumptions made about where state interests begin and end... It seemed of compelling interest at that time for the state to legislate sexual conduct to that degree. The anti-miscegenation laws are equally bizarre to us today. Hopefully, the case today leads to the same incredulity about a state interest in defining marriage in the future as you have about a state interest in demanding ""productive"" marriage today!"
csjvh2o,kyrsjo,"> Hopefully, the case today leads to the same incredulity about a state interest in defining marriage in the future as you have about a state interest in demanding ""productive"" marriage today!Unfortunately, there are still a lot of people who still demand state interest in ""productive"" marriage (or non-marriage, for what matters), such as many Catholics. Because of this, basic contraception only recently became easily available in Ireland, and was outright banned until 1978:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraception_in_the_Republic_of_IrelandAnd then there is the war over birth control which is currently raging in the US, with the Hobby Lobby case and such... The idiocy is still out there, even if it is currently sleeping, and if we let it, it may come back..."
csjxowk,WRCousCous,"Surprisingly, the cases determining the legality of contraception in the US only date to the 60s (Griswold vs. Connecticut) and 70s (Eisenstadt vs. Baird) as well. I don't think we need fear the return of that kind of thinking in the US (Hobby Lobby, a stupid decision, aside, which was more about who would pay for contraception rather than whether it was legal). Today's ruling really makes the return of such shallow and capricious public enforcement of arbitrary morality quite unlikely. Or at least so I'd like to think!"
cskbj73,kyrsjo,"Let's hope so.I still find it a strange concept that your employer can decide which kind of medical treatment you can easily access, and which kinds are more expensive. Why are US medical insurances paid by the employer, and not by the insured person directly or the state? It seems like a huge hassle, especially when switching jobs etc."
cskbo0w,WRCousCous,"Well... traditionally it (employer benefits like pensions, healthcare, etc.) was intended to make companies more competitive during labor shortages after WWII. And somehow, we've not quite adjusted to the fact that we don't live in that society anymore. It's ridiculous that a privately held corporation can decide such matters about healthcare for its employees, even though they can get better care elsewhere.And not everyone, especially those that need work the most and get paid the least, can just switch jobs on a whim (or even for a good reason). Labor mobility in the US is, to my understanding, pretty damn low. While there are jobs available (in places like SF and Seattle), few people can either afford to move or afford to live in the places with jobs when they arrive. For most of us, the relative quality of our health insurance is the least of our worries. It shouldn't be so, but it is."
csjshx7,ThatFargoDude,A hear a lot of conservative Catholics' heads popping.
csjycdw,TrappedAtReception,"The PDF is all of it. The actual exact wording of the majority opinion, as written by Justice Kennedy, starts on page 6 of the pdf, and goes to page 33. And yes I spent my morning ""pretending to be busy"" time reading that. It's good."
csk2p9h,windwolfone,"As Bristol Palin shows, marriage is not vital to procreation."
csjfbg3,Thats_Enterchangment,"Okay, so now that this is official, when can I watch Gay Divorce Court?"
csjhxol,Caris1,You gotta wait until the trashiest gays get married and then build up enough acrimonious bullshit to get divorced (EDIT: on national daytime television).I give it six months.
csjjiyi,deepasleep,This is Florida's chance to shine.
csjkb0u,,South Floridian here. I'll keep you updated.
csjlnxx,,Ha. So is Florida the western world's Korea?
csjlpb5,jpastore,It's the gay Mecca like San Francisco was in the 80s
csjlrwd,,"Nah, that's mostly just Miami. Fuck Miami. What a shit hole that place is."
csjmx25,jpastore,I was actually referencing Wilton manors in Broward. A section of ft Lauderdale. But yes Miami is a shit place. I joke that the best part is it is so close to the United States.
csjqlb6,g_chillin,"Just don't confuse Miami with Dade County. They are two different places. One inside the other, but two different places."
csjz7j4,compuguy,And Miami Beach. They are actually two different cities.....
csjn2kk,,Oh yeah I know Wilton Manors very well. I used to live just north in ghetto ass Oakland Park.
csjlsvo,,"Northern Florida might as well be a part of Georgia/Alabama, Central Florida SHOULD BE Florida and South Florida should be a completely separate state because the contrast between north and southern Florida is fucking massive."
csjm8n9,BFisOverMyShoulder,"Jacksonville here, can confirm."
csjmczd,,I really hate driving through Jacksonville on I-95. Is there still that insane construction going on? It's almost like driving through Miami.
csjmlpn,BFisOverMyShoulder,"Oh yes. It's even worse now. Seems the closer it gets to ""completion"" the more they fuck everything up. I just try to completely avoid it, especially on the motorcycle, doesn't always work though and I find my knuckles growing a little white."
csjn3xi,,"Damn, it's probably just as bad as when they redid I-595 here. Took like 5 years and it was a complete disaster. The lanes would change every other day."
csjr8an,SuperSulf,"At least the beltways in Jax are well done. I live in Orlando and if you don't take the tolls, you'll never get anywhere. Jax has waaaaaaaaaaaay better roads to get from one area to another if you don't mind the loops."
csjro5t,,"I'm sure once they're done it will be 100 times better. At least that was the case with I-595 when they built the express lanes.In Jax it looks like they are building new on and off ramps or something, is that right?"
csjs00h,SuperSulf,"Idk I haven't been to Jax in a few months. They did just start I-4 construction in Orlando though. It's going to suck periodically for about 2-3 years but then it's gonna rock. Current I-4 here is a clusterfuck of on-ramps followed by off-ramps, the *opposite* of good road planning. They're fixing most of that and adding lanes."
csjt84f,bacon_flavored,You and I do not live far from each other. I can tell.
csjy5ui,yourdadsbff,"Different state here, but yeah, it's getting to the point where most of my commute takes place *in* a goddamn ""road work area."""
csjyhej,BFisOverMyShoulder,"Oh jeez. My apologies. I think I'd have to quit cause I've gotta be on two wheels more often than not cause the truck hogs too much gas.. And I'm not a fan of people suddenly stopping because ""oh you mean the roads getting smaller?! It's not like it's been like this for what seems like years!"" or getting a nice chunk of loose asphalt to the chest at ~50 MPH."
csjz9l1,compuguy,Sounds like any major road construction. The NoVA Springfield Mixing Bowl was a mess when they were building that.
csjnn3f,manaworkin,Pretty sure the construction zones are a permanent and structurally relevant part of the roads around those parts.
csjo6rx,,"Because by the time they finish one project, there's already a new one going on."

csjlqp9,BrtneySpearsFuckedMe,Geez. Sorry. I just wanted to guess whst the link was before clicking it. I just wanted to do it for fun :(
csjmqfw,ohnoao,"I support your right to fun. No different then the ""I knew this was going to be ____"". Equal fun for all!!!!!!!!!"
csjnazv,,We'll have to wait for the Supreme Court decision on whether or not he can have fun.
csjpcq2,rushy68c,"If he can have fun, then what's stopping us from allowing animals to have fun? Or polygamists? No. It stops here."
csjpb7r,,"If he has fun, how can anyone else have fun?! He's *ruining* traditional fun for those of us who already have fun."
csjwow6,ohnoao,Well then you can just move to Canada.
csjmq3w,adventcrash,Exactly what I was thinking
csjux8d,Sienna_Crush,Immediately knew it would be this. I had a chuckle as this skit was the first thing I thought of when I saw the news.
csjxkx1,PM_ME_YOUR_SHPEENIS,"I went to watch this video and got pissed when there was an ad. But lo and behold, guess what the ad was? The video."
csk0ebw,imawesumm,"Honestly, I never thought the point of that skit was to show that awkward conversation. I thought the point was just to make a joke of the fact that some gays are really flambouyant and others aren't at all."
csk4u2d,moeru_gumi,"Nah, it is definitely talking about how one guy loves his boyfriend (maybe) but is using the excuse of marriage equality not being legal in order to avoid getting hitched to someone who's so immature and ridiculous."
csjnoxv,spaci999,Jesus Key & Peele really suck.
csjp52h,f3lbane,"I respect your opinion, even though it is wrong."
cskbry3,spaci999,"Are you trying to say they are funny? Please explain to me what was funny about this sketch. I mean, I guess the setup was mildly amusing, but they just drag it on way too long and don't seem to add anything of their own. If there is a joke I'm missing please let me know."
cskdp28,Lazukin,I mean I agree that it wasn't hilarious but it was definitely amusing imo.
cskixvr,spaci999,"That's the thing. All their sketches are mildly amusing at best. I guess they'd be ok if they lasted 30 seconds or so but instead they drag it on for 5 minutes while adding no joke other than the initial setup.EDIT also, being very successful comedians you'd expect most of their material to be truly hilarious and this clip to be just a bad fluke. Instead it's the other way round."
csjqx3t,ItsJustMeJerk,"It even says ""This isn't a disagree button."" when you mouse over the downvote button..."
csjqzly,Serei,"To be fair, he didn't exactly explain _why_ he doesn't like Key & Peele, so it's not like his post contributes to the conversation, either."
csjs9rk,Coldi33,"actually the quality of the sketch doesnt matter, only its relevancy"
csjk5qm,,[deleted]
csjn9oh,JGCISME,Gamophobia..the more you know :)
csjml4p,bestihad,Except for the fact that almost all of them are already married.
csjn6aa,SergeantIndie,"Well, that was our original excuse.Now it's a matter of saving to be able to afford a proper Elvis. There's a really good one in our area."
csjmlje,kalirion,"> ""Angie and I will consider tying the knot when everyone else in the country who wants to be married is legally able.”Well, they still have outs - ""everyone else"" is rather broad. They'd have to announce public support for some uncomfortable marriage types though.Also, ""consider"" isn't exactly a commitment."

csjr7a1,WiskerBuiscuit,Im in this group :( I've caught three guarder out of three weddings I've gone too.
csjk4fr,merme,"Of all shows, White Collar did an excellent job of showing this. One f the side characters was lesbian, and she had a life partner. They had the ""if it was legal"" discussion. Then it became legal in the show. Then they broke up. It was a fascinating dynamic, actually. And that season was a several years ago."
csjr8f9,Webify,"I loved White Collar, really sad to see it end. It never gained the popularity or ratings I thought it deserved. It may have been a little ridiculous at times, but I loved it. I just wish they did a better job of changing up the dynamic of the show."
csk70r5,Epic_Ninja88,I watched maybe a season of White Collar and stopped maybe 2 years ago. Gonna watch it right now.
csjm7oj,wrtChase,Well Matt Bomer (Neal Caffrey) is both gay and has been married to his partner for a few years now. Makes sense that the show would approach those topics
csjw7a5,Porn3487,Oh shit really? Yum.
csjoi1v,Gimli_the_White,"Yeah - I think White Collar might have been the first show to feature a gay character that wasn't portrayed as a foil or for lesbian kiss bait - she was just plain gay. My favorite was when Neal asked the Suit about having a lesbian work at the FBI. His response:""Haven't you heard? Don't ask, don't care."""
csjp6ou,NastyButler_,>I think White Collar might have been the first show to feature a gay character that wasn't portrayed as a foil or for lesbian kiss bait What about Oscar from The Office? Although he did have a kiss scene with Michael
csjpb7w,Paranitis,"What about Ellen Degeneres from ""Ellen""? She was the main character, and wasn't a foil OR lesbian kiss bait. When she came out basically to the world through her character, it was shocking, but then it was just ""oh yeah, she's a lesbian...but what is this episode going to be about?"""

csjqxsr,merme,"Oops, well sorry. I really really hate spoiling people, and I'm usually pretty careful about irl."
csjua1f,akeniscool,It's all good. It's bound to happen when you start watching a show after it has ended.
csjrin5,fallenKlNG,"Meh, I don't think that's all that spoiler-ish."
csjub2r,akeniscool,"I agree, it's not all that important to the show. Just giving /u/merme shit (and the girlfriend is crazy hot)."
csjvn4j,LilahMorrigan,The statute of limitations has definitely run out if the season aired 3 years ago.

csjpgfu,SpadoCochi,White collar was a fantastic show. And the main character is actually gay as well.
csjrfsz,fallenKlNG,"You mean, the **actor** that plays one of the main characters is gay (yes I know Neil pretty much steals the show but the way the show plays out it seems to me both of them are equally main characters). The actual character isn't gay."
csjud7o,,This fake bond is simply _faaaaaAAAAAbulouuuuus_
csjsqhc,SpadoCochi,"Yea anyone that has seen the show would know that, but I guess it's good to point that out for people that haven't seen it."
csjw7vy,DexterIsADog,"You do realize that was fiction, as are the Key and Peele characters, right? Why not take your cues from your actual gay friends?"
csjwpui,merme,What are you talking about?I was saying how this topic had already been addressed in media. I didn't say it was real. I said it was an interesting dynamic to a television show.

New excuse found. We did it reddit."
csjp4ww,THROWINCONDOMSATSLUT,"Funnily enough, my gay cousin was in this conundrum. We're in Massachusetts though where it's been legal since 2004.

csjhh15,scumbagPigeon,I never thought about people going backpacking in America. Maybe cuz I'm a narcissist American but only thought about people going backpacking in Europe. If I wasn't from here I wouldn't even know where to start.

csjiia6,whirlpool138,"National Parks and major cities. People do it all the time, hell people used to hitch hike around the country with no problems. The North East and Great Lakes are very densely populated so it's easy to go from city to city. Plus there are a lot of natural attractions in between everything. By the Atlantic Ocean, you have NYC-Washington D.C.- Boston corridor (that also includes Philadelphia and New Jersey) and then by the Great Lakes you have Pittsburgh-Toronto-Cleveland-Buffalo-Chicago. There is Niagara Falls, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and all the old art deco rust belt cities. You can also start up by the Adirondack Mountains in New York and take the North Country National Scenic trail down past the Great Lakes and hit heartland in North Dakota.Down South there are huge forests and mountain areas, Florida alone is a great state to go back packing around. Going around the Gulf Coast you can hit up New Orleans, Baton Rouge,Pensacola, Panama City and Tampa within a few days.There is also the Appalachian Trail, that is a backpacking trip by it's self. Traveling around the South vagabond style is different than it is up in the North East, where there are a lot of hostels, alternative housing situations (squats, co-ops, community centers) and hotels. Since everything is more spread out, people spend a lot of time in the rural country side that is in between all the big cities (which really is the best part of the Southern states). Out west has the mega huge National Parks and clusters of cities in between everything. You can back pack up the Pacific Coast from California up to Washington and Vancouver. There is all the cities located around Southern California, you can do a trip just around Death Valley, Los Angeles and then down to Mexico. The Bay Area has San Francisco, Oakland and then Humboldt County going up to Portland and eventually Seattle."

csjx4ux,June24th,"I found your expression very funny, although I don't mean to ruin the joke but I'm having a little trouble figuring out the exact meaning of ""butter"" in your sentence, maybe because English isn't my native language and urbandictionary is not helping either :("
csk079g,Plexipus,"People on Reddit like to refer to drama as ""popcorn,"" as in ""I'm going to grab a bag of popcorn and watch this shit go down."" Since butter is a popular topping for popcorn, the two have become interchangeable. If you look at /r/subredditdrama, you'll see people commonly using the two terms to joke about Reddit drama."

csjwjd2,iiiitsjess,You got that right! Don't look at the comments on the local news posts and Abbotts post. So much stupid. Yes I'm an idiot for even looking at them too. Ughh.
csjxbha,PatSajakMeOff,"It doesn't make me mad anymore. Today their ideology was defeated by something greater, love. Now their comments are just funny because, there is no fight. They've lost. They can cry all they want, but it doesn't change a thing. Gay people can marry, deal with it."
csjxk6y,iiiitsjess,"I'm going to try to take that view on it as well. Very good point. And yes, many of the comments really are quite humorous. Haha"
csk0i4q,doomngloom80,Yet I've seen political figures in Oklahoma and Kansas vowing to fight for their ideals and refusing to accept the decision. Is this just political bluster or can they simply refuse to play along?

csjubl4,adrianmonk,I literally don't understand why a Christian would be pissed off by this.Do these people think the government speaks on behalf of Christians?

csjzymg,scottevil110,We're pretty defensive the last week or so.

csjskcd,PreSchoolGGW,"It's pretty silly bc as a Northerner who now lives (and married a southerner) in the south, you see all the same kinds of people as you see up north. There are idiots and racists and kind-hearted people everywhere. There aren't nearly as many people down south who bash the north as vice versa, though."
csju0xq,fluffman86,"I don't bash the North. They can do as they please. What pisses me off is when northerners move down here to get a job or live more cheaply, then complain about EVERYTHING. Oh, we have shitty roads? Roads cost money, and you moved here for lower taxes. Pick one or the other, Rico. Oh, your new job isn't union? Well at least you have a job, while you lost your union job and couldn't compete your way into the job market where you were. Don't like how we can't drive on ice and snow? There's only 2-3 inches a year, for just a few days or a week. The rest of the year we have gorgeous weather. Plus, we can't clear all the roads, again partly because of taxes and partly because we don't need the infrastructure to do so for a few days a year."

csjr1jn,,"Yea, one's that moved there."
csju8ow,alexbhood,"I know. I live there. But on the whole, it's ruled by really ignorant people. Particularly law makers. The South has historically fought tooth and nail against civil rights. It did that for slavery, women's suffrage, desegregation and black rights, and now gay rights. Also the South historically hates science. There are plenty of good people here, but overall it's the region of the US that we should be most embarrassed of. Today my Facebook feed is filled with former schoolmates and family members raging at the idea that they are looked down upon for flying the Confederate flag and also about how the gaypocalypse is now and the end times are coming."

Now that this issue is resolved you will strart to see a split on issues with gay people as many were forced or drawn into progressive parties because dems were mostly for gay issues while reps were not. Now that this is no longer an issue and Obama with pushing this issue has disgusted much of the black community it will be interesting to see what the future holds for the dem party."
csjxmkm,inb4ElonMusk,Just like abortion is no longer an issue ever since Roe v. Wade?
cskzeb0,Unclehams,"there will always be that fringe element both on the left and the right.. PETA, Earth Liberation Front, KKK, Black Panthers, Anti Choice, NAMBLA, West Boro Church... However instead of people on both sides WANTING something legal, there will now be fighting over people like churches that refuse to do it. It will now go to the religious freedom aspect. Once that's been established there will be a fringe element for that than poof... On to the next wedge issue politicians use to wedge people while they steal tax dollars, make special deals etc etc political favors Bush did it, Obama did it."
csltvq0,inb4ElonMusk,"I wouldn't call abortion an fringe issue by any means. I think you're probably half right, and I do agree that politicians of both parties use social issues to distract voters from the important stuff."
cskfm1w,,"The majority of those folks jumped ship to the republican party as part of the Southern Strategy. Which was a deliberate quest to lock in the racist southern vote, which is sadly a strong political block. I wish the republicans much joy of them, so long and good riddance."
cskzbfi,Unclehams,"hahaha and more haha That's a funny one there with just in the last ten years we have had ex KKK DEMOCRAT in congress so um yea ok. On another note I bet its all the evil white republicans in charge of the ghettos or the unions stealing all the tax dollars to help poor uneducated voters who keep voting the assholes into power. This next election you will see a huge resurgence of the middle right and right in this country. On another note I am sooooo very happy about gay marriege being legal. Now democrats won't have that leg to stand on and more gay people can be free to JUMP the higher taxes , send jobs over seas, bad leadership ship and consider other more pressing issues than two guys having a slip of paper that says their married."

csjmrnx,AmazingMarv,The South should finally secede like they've always wanted. There's clearly a distinct difference in culture and attitudes with regard to social issues between the South and the rest of the nation.

csjuopv,jimejim,Some people get way too comfortable on Facebook and assume everyone else around them believes what they do. It's fun to watch the crazy ones implode though.

csjr03a,,"I've seen a lot of people ask how the Supreme Court has the authority to decide this issue for states. For those interested, I am an American lawyer and I can answer that question with some insight.Yes, the Supreme Court does have the authority to make sweeping decisions that invalidate any and all state laws which conflict with its ruling. The Supreme Court finds this authority in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and from the very significant court case of *Marybury vs. Madison* which more or less established the Supreme Court's absolute authority to literally ""say what the law is.""States do have autonomy to decide certain issues for themselves. These are judicial notions of 'comity' and 'parity,' the idea that state governments are better equipped to deal with local and regional issues rather than a distant Congress in Washington. In fact, the laws of contracts traditionally belong to states, which is why every state in the U.S. has slight legal differences in how contracts are formed, enforced, written, etc. Marriage, in its most basic legal form, is a contract entered into by two consenting adults, which is why marriage laws have been decided by state legislatures and state courts.But there's an important amendment to the U.S. Constitution that (as of today) strips away the right of a state to define marriage in their laws as a union between one man and one woman: the Fourteenth Amendment (and more specifically the Equal Protection Clause) which states:> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Without getting too much into the nuances of the Supreme Court's varying standards of review (although I certainly can if you're interested), the Supreme Court traditionally reviews Equal Protection issues under what's called a 'rational basis review.' It is the most permissive standard the Court can adopt--that is, it is the least difficult standard to meet in order to successfully defend a law from being struck down. The review asks whether a law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. With respect to the issue of marriage equality, the question is: Are state laws banning same-sex marriage rationally related to the legitimate government interest of protecting the institution of marriage?To that question the Supreme Court has apparently said 'no.' The fact that the Supreme Court today could not find any rational basis for these state bans related to the stated goal of protecting the institution of marriage says *a lot*. The Court is literally saying there is no rational relationship between banning same-sex marriage and protecting marriage. Thus, same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, and every such law in the United States is immediately invalidated.The Supreme Court has made sweeping judgments like this before, although decisions of this magnitude are quite rare. For examples, see *Brown vs. Board of Education* (which held that state laws enacting racial segregation were unconstitutional) and *Loving vs. Virginia* (which held that state laws banning interracial marriage were unconstitutional).TL;DR: Yes, the Supreme Court has the authority to say what the law is for the entire nation. Yes, marriage is traditionally an area kept to state law, but only up to a limit until a law runs headlong into the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.**Important Edit:** It appears I've disseminated some amount of disinformation for which I apologize (I did not get around to actually reading the full opinion until now). As pointed out to me by /u/Armonster20, the Supreme Court **DID NOT** review this case under rational basis. Rather, it was decided under a strict scrutiny review. The majority opinion does not even make much mention at all of the words ""sexual orientation,"" instead focusing on the fundamental right of marriage. A lot of you have asked about the varying standards of review, but I must confess that constitutional law is outside my usual day-to-day practice and I'm doing the best I can to remember the basics I learned in law school. I could try to explain the standards of review in detail but I'm afraid of saying something inaccurate. The least I can do is direct you **[here](http://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2014/01/challenging-laws-3-levels-of-scrutiny-explained.html)**.But to go into just a little more detail, the strict scrutiny test is the most demanding standard of review to which the Supreme Court can subject a law. The reason the Supreme Court chose to review this case under this very exacting test is quite logical actually: the Supreme Court has previously said that any law that abridges a ""fundamental right"" must meet the most demanding scrutiny, and the Supreme Court has previously deemed the right to marry as a fundamental right. Thus, because any state law that excludes an entire class of people from participating in marriage obviously implicates the fundamental right to marry, we get strict scrutiny. (FYI - Another fundamental right under the Constitution is the right to have an abortion.)What this means is that the majority made it damn-near impossible for the respondents (i.e., the states defending their same-sex marriage bans) to win in this case. What this does NOT mean is that any future LGBT issues will be given the same standard review, unless they of course deal with marriage. Most likely, any future litigation on LGBT issues will be subject to rational basis review or something that's informally been called ""rational basis review with a bite""--a standard somewhere between normal rational basis and intermediate scrutiny."

csjvacy,Z0MGbies,"YOU SIR! If you have the time, could you please give me your opinion on this question (i asked it elsewhere in this thread but noticed youre a lawyer, aka my intended audience).I dont mean any offence to your career, your country, or your peers -- but here's my question in fairly blunt terms:**What's up with your Justice Scalia??** As a recent law graduate and having just passed my bar exams (meaning I've recently spent the last 4 years reading judgments), I'm absolutely horrified that someone so utterly incompetent and out of touch is on your Supreme Court bench.I have no biases here. I'm not American or have any ties to the US, and I'm not gay. But Scalia dissents on the legalisation like a child not getting his own way. On top of this, he (recently?) justified torture by US govt by referencing the success of Jack Bauer on the show '24' (in defiance of the overwhelming evidence against its usefulness). That's like referencing the show 'Supernatural' for reasons why we should be burning witches again.What on earth is someone that unintelligent and inept doing on the Supreme Court bench (or any bench for that matter)? He is making a mockery of the law, and sapping from the nobility of the profession.Is it an American thing maybe? All of the New Zealand and Australian (and a great many UK) judges I've read are absolutely brilliant, even if I might disagree with them from time to time. In fact the worst thing I've read in terms of ignorance or incompetence was a judge failing to appreciate that Facebook messenger was more than a public diary (she was overturned anyway).If a commonwealth judge started making judgments like Justice Scalia they would be removed overnight.Can [you] please explain this nonsense??P.S. To clarify, this message contains 100% of my knowledge of Justice Scalia. Perhaps my information is very out of context, or there is more information to provide a better context. At any rate, I *literally* don't know anything more about the guy, so maybe I'm way off the mark."
csjwesp,,"> As a recent law graduate and having just passed my bar exams (meaning I've recently spent the last 4 years reading judgments), I'm absolutely horrified that someone so utterly incompetent and out of touch is on your Supreme Court bench.You're not alone. Having gone through law school myself and having read many, many, many Supreme Court decisions written by Scalia, I can only say this: he has an absolutely brilliant legal mind, but he very clearly allows his ideology and political bias to clout his better judgment at times.What people don't know and would be surprised to learn about Scalia is that when it comes to certain issues like Due Process and the rights of criminal defendants, Justice Scalia is actually *incredibly* progressive, and he's even gone toe-to-toe with Justices Thomas and Alito on those issues. Some of my favorite Supreme Court opinions authored by Scalia are the ones where he very emphatically defends the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights of criminal defendants. Before I lambaste Scalia, I have to acknowledge his contributions on that front and admit that the guy is not stupid.But all that being said, Justice Scalia has a history of making a farce of logic and legal application. I'm familiar with his comments about Jack Bauer and my head spun just like yours. He's also admittedly aware that his opinions contain far more ""flair,"" if you will, than his fellow justices, and he's unapologetic about it. (And honestly, I don't mind his candor, and part of me wishes more judges would be honest about their feelings.)But to answer your question: Antonin Scalia is a Supreme Court justice because Ronald Reagan nominated him and the Senate approved him by a 98-0 vote in 1986. He was very likely nominated by Ronald Reagan because Scalia was right-leaning and had all the major qualifications. In the United States, Supreme Court justices are appointed for life unless they resign, retire, take senior status, or are removed after impeachment. No Supreme Court justice has ever been impeached, and nothing Scalia has done (his contemptible affronts to legal logic aside) makes him eligible for impeachment.I honestly think Scalia knows what he's doing and knows that he doesn't have the legal support he claims to have on issues such as marriage equality or recounting votes. But for him it doesn't matter. He's got a bloated ego and cares more about padding a conservative agenda than applying the law."

csk2gh9,,"Yes it does. For example, in law school I wrote a 65-page paper on the Supreme Court's 8-1 decision in *Montana vs. Wyoming* (I might add: a very interesting state vs. state case about disputed water rights that arose under original jurisdiction) in which Justice Scalia was the lone dissenter. I actually wrote the paper vehemently siding with Scalia because I could not for the life of me understand the majority's logic. I'll always remember a joke Justice Scalia inserted in his first footnote on the first page of his dissent when he referred to *Wyomingans* with an asterisk:> The dictionary-approved term is “Wyomingite,” which is also the name of a type of lava, see Webster's New International Dictionary 2961 (2d ed. 1957). I believe the people of Wyoming deserve better.Also, in a Supreme Court opinion, the only words which have any real legal effect is language that states what the law is or should be. The rest of the opinion is what's called ""dicta,"" which is any language which states an authoritative opinion but does not necessarily have any legally binding effect."

The major overriding factors in choosing a candidate is someone that matches your ideology (restraint vs. activist) and having a long history of decisions usually plays against the candidate, since it becomes clear to the senators how this person is likely to vote once they are on the SC."
csjwbcr,JunkyMonkeyTwo,"I'm an American, and not a lawyer. But, just know that many of us share your opinion on Scalia. That being said, Justices have indefinite tenure for reasons of remaining beyond external influences, so having several justices rather than few is allowing us to get by with the few bad apples that slipped by during certain Presidencies. Thusly, even though I disagree with Scalia usually, and his reasoning is often suspect, I'd defend him holding his position by virtue of believing in our Supreme Court process...thusfar. Even if it is slow, at least there is progress made that can be instantaneous and universally enforced (for the US), such as today."

Scalia is currently 79 and the average life expectancy for men in the US is 76.That means he'll be 81 years old when Obama leaves office and 85 by the time the next presidential term ends. If he's not dead I don't doubt that he's going to be basically unable to participate in any meaningful way. I seriously doubt he's going to live close to a decade longer than the average, though.It's not really going to be up to him, he's just getting too old. Even if he lives longer than Rehnquist I doubt it's going to be by much.> Justice Ginsburg is likely the next justice to be replaced. She's 82 and she's had several battles with cancer over the years.Yeah this thought occurred to me today as well. Kennedy is getting pretty old too. He may be able to make it passed the next presidential term _maybe_ but I don't see him making it passed that.

csjw5db,katamariballin,"Thanks -- great point in the arbitrary line between fundamental rights under SS and gay marriage under RB. I'm curious what standard of review was actually applied. During oral argument it seemed that Roberts was hinting that this should be determined under intermediate scrutiny since prohibiting someone to marry another of the same sex could be characterized as gender discrimination. My quick read of the opinion made me think they actually did end up using intermediate scrutiny based on suspect classification, not gender (and not SS as I wrote in my original comment in error). Guess I too need a few beers and to re-read the opinion to be sure.edit: words"
csk1oqr,inacave,"I'm hard pressed to believe that 4 justices honestly felt that the State's interest in protecting the institution of marriage met intermediate scrutiny.

csjtfs9,red_wine_and_orchids,"> Without getting too much into the nuances of the Supreme Court's varying standards of review (although I certainly can if you're interested), the Supreme Court traditionally reviews Equal Protection issues under what's called a 'rational basis review.' It is the most permissive standard the Court can adopt--that is, it is the least difficult standard to meet in order to successfully defend a law from being struck down. The review asks whether a law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. With respect to marriage equality, the question is: Are state laws banning same-sex marriage rationally related to the legitimate government interest of protecting the institution of marriage?> > To that question the Supreme Court said 'no.' The fact that the Supreme Court today could not find any rational basis for these state bans related to the stated goal of protecting the institution of marriage says a lot.

csjvl02,KosherNazi,"Can you discuss Roberts dissent? He seemed pretty vehement that this decision was bad for the supreme court as an institution, and that the court overstepped its bounds. Is there any merit to that, or do you think its a cover for more conservative views on marriage?"
csk2wad,recycled_ideas,"I'm not a lawyer, but it's worth noting that the supreme court did not want to decide this issue, likely even the justices which supported it.I'm surprised that he voted against the majority, given his concern with the legacy of the court, but I don't disagree that a result like Ireland would have been better for America and for the court.The last time that the court made a decision on social issues that the American people were not ready for was Roe vs Wade. I agree with that decision, but there is no denying that it has politicised the court to an incredible degree and in doing so damaged the court.That decision happened more than forty years ago and there is basically no real chance of it being overturned, but every single supreme court appointment is still coloured by it.This decision will be much the same, at least for a while. Hopefully not quite as bad though.TL;DR I don't agree with Robert's assertion that this was beyond the courts authority, this was clearly an equal protection issue. I do agree that there will be a price to pay."

csk4m20,dcman00000,"I want to see what you have to say about something I posted here. Here is what I said:I want to add to the discussion from the other side. I'm not against gay marriage, but I want to bring to light what I think are important points that Scalia talks about. I beleive that he has been unfairly pigeonholed as some kind of reactionary maniac, and although he is abrasive for sure, He brings up points that are no less substantive and no less important to our society and our system of government...This is what he says in his dissent more or less. Here is the link, he starts on page 69. http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf* He talks about legal precedent being demolished here because it has been regarded as a state right for a long time* He talks about a literal plain meaning of the due process clause does not create a right for gay marriage (he's right, but the majority didn't use a plain meaning of the due process clause)* He talks about how any reasonable interpretation of the constitution leaves the issue of marriage in the ninth and tenth amendments...basically meaning that either the people (through representatives for example) or the states themselves are reserved this right. In a purely literal sense he's probably right. But agian the majority didn't use the plain meaning of the text, they used what is colloquially known as ""living breathing document"" legal reasoning. * He talks about how vague issues in the constitution and law are reviewed under what evidence there is to the original intent of those who wrote the law meant. Under this review there is no evidence that in the decades following the ratification of the 14th amendment that the generation that ratified the amendment intended this to mean anything other than the plain meaning of the text. So yeah, its actually more in depth than what the news organizations are leading on, and what is being linked to here on Reddit. In full disclosure **I support gay marriage**, but I can't necessarily disagree with the legal reasoning that scalia put forth. He's basically arguing that the integrity of the constitution was harmed by this decisions, which is an important co-consideration on this case. I believe that to protect our constitution, and our heritage of freedom, democracy, and the principals upon which our society is based than this was the wrong way to do so. So how else do you ask we should've done this? A state by state change would have sufficed, but perhaps would have taken longer ( I grant you that). It would have preserved our constitution in the process however, which is always a good thing, including for our gay brothers and sisters. Another way is through a constitutional amendment, that gave an explicit constitutional right to gay marriage, much harder to achieve, but also protects our constitution and legal system (common law and precedent) in the process. I figured I'd chime in, not because I am against gay marriage (I'm not), but because this discussion on the decision I feel misses important parts of this dissent. Undoubtedly, Scalia has been unfairly pigeonholed as some kind of crazy reactionary by reddit and the media, but this ignores important points I believe he brings up. Essentially what I'm saying is that we should celebrate todays decisions in the sense that freedom won out. However we must also be aware of the pitfalls of the legal reasoning used by the majority, and how problematic that can be to our society and our constitution."
cskch5x,Gingor,"Since you're a lawyer: In my country, every law (and the constitution) has to be interpreted according to the will of the historical lawmaker, or as close an approximation as can be gotten through the assorted documents around the process of the law being made. With that in mind, I thought this was a tragically politically motivated decision that goes heavily against the will of a bunch of 19th century dudes that drafted the amendment. Apparently it isn't though.I'm guessing US law doesn't take the historical lawmakers' will into account? Or if it does, how does it do so?"
cskgffp,PM_Your_Boobs_Ill_R8,"Really quick easy to answer question. I was under the impression that Marriage laws allowed opposite sex marriage, rather than disallowed same sex marriage.

I don't feel that someones wants or feelings about a topic like this should warrant a supreme court ruling that shakes the foundation of what it means to defend the constitution. The precedent set here is scary because the original intent behind the 14th amendment was to insure former slaves had equal rights and nothing to do with marriage. >The Equal Protection Clause applies because the government is restricting the right to marry to only couples of opposite genders. The laws allowing marriage in the states are not restrictions on same sex marriage rather than opportunity's for straight marriage that everyone can use.

csjf7nq,Favorable,Um.. i don't think... that the supreme court legalized that yet..
csjfr0r,notCrazyMike,"Yeah, they'll probably both have to marry the same farm animal."
csjfrix,HSChronic,"That is next. After gay marriage it is farm animals, after farm animals it is plants. I am going to be psyched when I can marry my ficus."

csjgqsz,Namika,"As much as I kinda agree that non-abusive bestially should be legal considering we slaughter animals anyway... However, marriage to animals doesn't really make sense since marriage is a joining of two to form a union.

I suppose if you had like a crazy smart monkey that actually showed signs of sentience, then sure."

csju6f4,Hoyata21,I forgot their name but there was this couol who said they would devorice of this happened
csjp6sb,futurebitchin,Wow you should take this somewhere where other people would give a flying shit about what you say.
csjeb6w,antiqua_lumina,Opinion [here](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf) (pdf).
csjexob,cats_in_tiny_shoes,"Scalia's dissenting opinion is just so salty, decrying the over-reaching power of the very Court on which he sits. Also, this:""'The nature of marriage is that,through its enduring bond, two persons together can findother freedoms, such as expression, intimacy, and spirituality.'(Really? Who ever thought that intimacy andspirituality [whatever that means] were freedoms? And ifintimacy is, one would think Freedom of Intimacy isabridged rather than expanded by marriage. Ask thenearest hippie. Expression, sure enough, is a freedom, butanyone in a long-lasting marriage will attest that thathappy state constricts, rather than expands, what one canprudently say.)""Sorry you're unhappy in your marriage, I guess, I dunno, brah."
csjft53,,"You know you are putting forth a strong legal argument when you use the phrase ""Ask the nearest hippie."""
csjh7nx,Myron-Gaines,"Holy fucking shit, he actually said that. I thought the guy quoting it just hadn't ended his quotes early enough and that *he* was saying that."
csjhs9w,,That's what I thought too. What a jackass.
csjsrt5,DabuSurvivor,"I know huffpost blows sometimes (many times) - but I love how in their article on it, they actually did go and ask the nearest hippie they could find, and he was like ""uh i've heard both things from fellow hippies idk what scalia's on about?"""
csjjj45,thegreatestajax,"He wasn't attempting to put forth a legal argument in that section. His dissent is but a few pages, give it a read."
csjjvrj,,In that section? The entire dissenting opinion is a legal argument for why he disagrees with the majority opinion. Anything within that is not a legal argument is superfluous and should've been relegated to his blog.
csjr5or,thegreatestajax,"So you don't read many court opinions? The primary content of all four dissents is that the majority did not write a legal opinion. You're perfectly free to celebrate or condemn this ruling, but anyone that reads the opinions will recognize that the two groups have very different understandings of what their jobs as justices are and what the actual question at hand was."
csjs5nl,,I've read plenty of them. I don't see how what you've just written contradicts what I said.
csjss3a,thegreatestajax,the vast majority of opinion content is not attempting to make a legal argument. It is providing background and context. It's even several pages into Kennedy's opinion before he attempts to bring legal analysis into it. Your statement framed Scalia's dissent as being largely a category error. This would presupposed your unfamiliarity with the category as his dissent was quite typical of it.
csju5kf,,Legal argument in this context meant an argument about law. And this is exactly what his entire dissenting opinion is including both background and context. Please go try to feel superior to someone else now.
csjx4tj,thegreatestajax,legal argument=argument about law. Got it. I see the misunderstanding...which underpins the entirety of judicial disagreement today.
csjllj2,TheNonis,What year is it?
csjgrjj,Wetzilla,"Thomas' is even worse. > The corollary of that principle is that human dignitycannot be taken away by the government. Slaves did notlose their dignity (any more than they lost their humanity)because the government allowed them to be enslaved.Those held in internment camps did not lose their dignitybecause the government confined them. And those deniedgovernmental benefits certainly do not lose their dignitybecause the government denies them those benefits. Thegovernment cannot bestow dignity, and it cannot take itaway."
csjhzvp,redpony6,what the fuck
csjiesu,Wetzilla,"Seriously. If you're saying your position is similar to allowing people to own slaves and forcing Japanese people into internment camps, maybe you should rethink your position."
csjmi4h,Leprechorn,"It's simple, really: he's saying that banning gay marriage is basically slavery, and that's why it's a good thing - because dignity is not relevant"
csjke3a,InVultusSolis,Thomas's statement is much worse than Scalia's in substance. Scalia's was very poorly written.
csjjl3t,Sabuleon,"What the hell, this guy doesn't even know the basic definition of dignity or he'd recognize that everything he said there **is exactly a denial of dignity**. I'm furious. At his level, you can't just redefine a word because it suits you."
csjl9ty,manomirth,"Wow, I guess I don't know either. Tell the people who went through those things they have no dignity. It's not something anyone can take away."
csjljzt,Sabuleon,"Alright, I worded my complaint wrongly. I am angry at the fact that he so glibly puts out these examples of **attempts to remove dignity** as though they were just walks in the park.In a Buddhist way I agree that dignity is a core element we all have, no one can give or take it away from us. But there is such a thing as abuse. Those examples are abuses of the human condition.""Hey, it's no big deal if I freaking hit and batter you every day man! You're still cool!""The hypocrisy.... ergh."
csjm27l,manomirth,Well said.
csjiqxo,,"If the government can't take away our dignity, then how come they force us to work for them 4/12 months every year?"
csjf3cs,NewtAgain,I'd partly agree that marriage is kind of an outdated institution. But I believe it's an outdated institution that everybody has the right to participate in.
csjhpf9,,"I too rolled my eyes at Roberts' opinions on ruling on marriage because of it being an ""institution""; it's not constitutionally relevant at all."
csjinie,res_proxy,Do you have any ideas on what you would change about it? (Serious)
csjos54,NewtAgain,"I don't like the fact that you are legally tied to another person. Being married means you are treated differently for tax reasons which in my opinion is an unfair advantage to people who are married. There are financial incentives for people to get married and i think that is wrong. Also the fact that after a divorce you can still be financially tied to a person. My main issue with marriage is that it isn't just about love, it's also about who gets your shit when you die. By default it is your wife / husband and legally they have to consent to it not being them. I cannot leave my 401k to my sister unless my wife (i'm not married) agrees. Marriage shouldn't be a legally binding financial contract."
csjfrqk,sweaterbuckets,"wait. That quote, with the parentheticals, was in his dissent?"
csjft1a,cats_in_tiny_shoes,"~~Footnote 22 from his dissent.~~Edit, sorry, that was a different funny quote. This appears on [page eight here](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf)."
csjg2u5,FoxyBrownMcCloud,>Really? Who ever thought that intimacy ... [whatever that means] This is the least surprising inquiry from Scalia ever.
csjh5bj,overzealous_dentist,"He's right though... if it's about intimacy, then adding more marriage does not maximize intimacy. So clearly it's not about intimacy. It's about something else. My understanding is the Court Opinion is really badly worded and sometimes illogical, which Scalia is upset about."
csjhsw2,redpony6,"it does provide more opportunities for intimacy occur among people, thoughlegally state-sanctioned intimacy, anyway, which was the whole point of this"
csjidfp,overzealous_dentist,"Marriage doesn't enable intimacy, though - you can have 100% intimacy with a person without marriage. Marriage, on the other hand, actively prevents you from being intimate with anyone else, reducing overall potential intimacy.I feel like I'm in a physics class about potential energy here."
csjjpdm,Sabuleon,"It's not potential when the relationship type suits you. If marriage feels confining in that sense, look at other forms of relationship maybe; but there are definitely people who are happier with just one other, and don't find such a ""reduction in potential"", they'd argue the opposite.Deepening intimacy with one other also counts, and you can't do that when you're too busily involved with everyone else."
csjke0x,overzealous_dentist,"You're right, but you don't have to be married to be monogamous."
csjlcxd,Sabuleon,"Ah, true that, but that also ignores the (required) legal aspect of relationships in America. I would have been happier in a recognized domestic partnership if the USA didn't require people to be married for people to benefit from most forms of legal protection.In that sense, marriage actually forces some additional intimacy onto people."
csjll67,overzealous_dentist,"I see what you mean - I interpreted ""intimacy"" to be more of a physical/romantic inclination, rather than ""interconnectedness."" Good talk here!"
csjhs2n,,"I think you're a little closer to the mark than the ""LOL Scalia be salty!"" comments. Basically, something does not become a Constitutionally-protected privilege simply because someone thinks, correctly or incorrectly, it enhances freedom. It becomes a Constitutionally-protected privilege when the Constitutional explicitly protects it."
csjib0b,overzealous_dentist,"Agreed - he mentions that elsewhere: even if the founders valued freedom, that doesn't mean we can approve freedoms not founded in law."
csjfyur,punk_in_drublic_,"For real, I can't believe he actually invoked the word ""hippie"" in what seems to be a derogatory manner. Knowing how conservative he is, I'm certain he meant it at least as a mild pejorative.Jerk."
csjjtc3,AHSfav,Of course he did. Doubt he's ever even met a hippie. What an asshole
csjhjxd,pab_guy,Scalia is such a mess psychologically. The fact that he lays it all bare without an ounce of self-awareness is actually kind of charming... he literally can't stop his lizard brain from popping up and shitting all over his thoughts.
csjgsiy,hawkian,"I can't believe he wrote down the sentence, ""Really?"" in a dissenting opinion from the bench of the supreme court. That's like, forum-retort rhetoric..."
csjg4ue,GuyForgett,"My favorite quote was ""If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opin- ion for the Court that began: “The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,” I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie."" He is such a little whiny bitch."
csjg74f,cats_in_tiny_shoes,"I thought for a second your user name was Guy Forgetti, and I was like, motherfucker *hates* ""Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives."" But I see now that you do not.I hope."
csjglhn,GuyForgett,"I actually gate Guy Fierri. I love the food he features, I just hate him and his bullshit frosted tips and shit. This pretty much sums it up: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-guys-american-kitchen-bar-in-times-square.html?_r=0"
csjgoci,cats_in_tiny_shoes,"It is the best review ever. I work in publicity, and I once received a press release about a Guy Fieri cruise. Can you imagine being stuck on the high seas with him? No land in sight?"
csjfogc,aldo_reset,He only decries the power of the Supreme Court when it doesn't side with him.
csjfvz8,,"Eh, he's pretty consistent in what he thinks the court can and can't determine."
csjmabt,Moirawr,OMG is that from Scalia? That's just a pile of crap logic I expect from 14 year olds on the internet.
csjgez6,reddit_beats_college,Scalia is saltier than Carthage in 149 b.c.
csjf08y,the_whalerus,That is enormous. My phone tells me over a hundred pages.
csjfifk,bluemax413,"103, I just printed it out."

csjrlcu,FireHazard11,"That seems... rather inefficient, but whatever floats your boat."
csjkhdi,InVultusSolis,At work? Stick it to the man!
csjftn3,ADefiniteDescription,Margins are huge though. I skimmed it in about 15 minutes or so.
csjeo9v,VanDelay_Industry,Kennedy did a great job with it.
csjgkea,ApprovalNet,"The government should have no control over marriages period. You shouldn't have to ""legalize"" any type of marriage. So although it's a victory for equal rights it's still an acceptance of the fact that the government gets to have input on your private relationships and require a license for that relationship."
csjj7tb,pessimistic_platypus,"Well, legal marriages come with extra financial benefits and such. And to grant those, marriage has to be defined.I mean, gay couples could have been married in any state by a religious official, but such a marriage would not have been recognized by the law.So this says ""all of the states' governments must recognize same-sex marriages as valid."""
csjmtsg,ApprovalNet,">Well, legal marriages come with extra financial benefits and such.Is there a good reason for this? I don't think so."
csjmytg,pessimistic_platypus,"Based on a half-remembered conversation, it's to encourage couples to have children. The costs of raising a child are intimidating, and any relief helps.Actually, children have their own financial benefits... So I assume marriage benefits help encourage parents to stay together?"
csjnaiu,ApprovalNet,"> Based on a half-remembered conversation, it's to encourage couples to have children.Which is pretty much negated with same-sex marriage."
csjppng,pessimistic_platypus,"It is not. Many same-sex couples adopt or use a donor to have a biological child (well one of the couple, anyway). But besides the children of same-sex couples, it's about more than children.I read this in a few articles fairly recently, though I forget where they were. Basically, it was about dignity. Marriage serves to unite people in love, and it lets the world recognize them as such.Maybe some of the *legal* benefits of marriage are to encourage children, but the ""spiritual"" benefits are not. The [court's opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf) in today's ruling says it better than I ever could (page 3):> The lifelong union of a man and a woman always has promised nobility and dignity to all persons, without regard to their station in life. Marriage is sacred to those who live by their religions and offers unique fulfillment to those who find meaning in the secular realm. Its dynamic allows two people to find a life that could not be found alone, for a marriage becomes greater than just the two persons. Rising from the most basic human needs, marriage is essential to our most profound hopes and aspirations.It may be somewhat exaggerated, it carries the point well. To deny some people marriage is to deny them those ""most profound hopes and aspirations.""&nbsp;But to bring this back to the original point, the law *does* have to regulate marriage to some degree.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside marriage, there is little legal ground for two individuals becoming family. Adoption allows it, but it is not an equal relationship, and doesn't provide a connection any different than between any two family members. Because marriage represents the connection of two individuals in a unique manner, the law has a framework for merging them legally as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the same way all other legal institutions are regulated, so must be marriage. And so it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some restrictions have gone too far, preventing couples in love from joining each other as so many others have for centuries. This ruling has removed some of those restrictions, allowing one more group to marry as they wish."
csk38lp,ApprovalNet,"> Many same-sex couples adoptYou said it was to ""encourage couples to have children"" - that's very different from adoption.And I think we're past the point of needing government intervention encourage breeding, don't you?"
cskgit4,pessimistic_platypus,"No, having children and adopting children are, in this case, effectively the same. Adopted children have the same costs as biological children, and thus warrant the same benefits.Rather than encouraging breeding, though, the benefits of marriage are partially to encourage the families to stay together, and (more importantly) to help alleviate the extreme costs of raising a child.But it is irrelevant if the government is encouraging breeding. Perhaps they are. Whether or not such a thing is appropriate is an entirely different matter.&nbsp;And look at the rest of my last post - marriage is not just about children."
cski72d,ApprovalNet,"> No, having children and adopting children are, in this case, effectively the same.No they're very different. Adopted children are already here, so you don't need a financial incentive to ""have them""."
cskiuie,pessimistic_platypus,"Incentive to *adopt*, then."
cskj0bf,ApprovalNet,"OK, still sounds like a misguided attempt at social engineering by the government though."
csjitmv,,"Which is why it's good that people are happy, but they should keep in mind that this is a release from oppression rather than a help."
csjp975,darkapplepolisher,Something positive can come of that. Salty gaycist states might even be crazy enough to break government away from marriage out of spite.

csjhhyh,ThisBuddhistLovesYou,Felt the heat from that burn while wading in the Pacific Ocean.
csjiuur,roobens,Explain this joke for an Englishman whose only has the vaguest concept of who or what a Bristol Palin is?
csjj3co,qwicksilfer,Bristol Palin (daughter of a conservative former governor turned talking head) has been pregnant twice (while preaching abstinence only) while never being married. She was supposed to get married a few months ago but they broke it off days before the wedding and then she announced she's pregnant again (though she did not say if the ex-fiance is the baby daddy).
csjj9tz,newnrthnhorizon,"She is the daughter of Sarah Palin. Sarah Palin was John McCain's running mate in the 2008 presidential election which Obama ended up winning.Sarah Palin is a stereotypical Christian conservative who is against gay marraige, abortion, etc.During the 2008 election, it was revealed that Bristol had a baby when she was 17 out of wedlock (big no-no for Christians). Just recently, she (Bristol) cancelled her wedding to some other guy, and a few days ago, she revealed that she's pregnant.The Palins are concerned about the sanctity of marriage and how it should be between a man and a woman. The fact that Bristol has 1 and soon to be 2 children out of wedlock is very hypocritial due to her Christian values (no sex before marriage)."
csjj7vh,intellectualarsenal,"bristol palin is the daughter of former vice-president candidate sarah palin,this is important because the palin family avocates two things 1.banning gay marriage 2.no premarital sex among straight people bristol palin is now pregnant with her second child and is still not married"
csjj92e,ilessthan3math,[Here is a post from yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/3b4lhu/).Basically she is a politician's daughter who got knocked up twice and she isn't married. But she is super vocal about religious stuff and abstinence.

csji08x,CuriosityKat9,We will probably find out the father based on who ends up getting sued for child support.
csjio89,Dicho83,"Not necessarily. Even if a man can genetically prove a child is not his, the courts can still forced him to pay child support."
csjji02,CuriosityKat9,"That's only if the dad was a functional father for a while though. In this case the guy isn't even in the picture, so I doubt that would be the case here."

csjjccj,darlingfan,"Sure I can; not only do I feel most people's takeaway came from a shitty title instead of the article, I get the impression that they think religious people are incapable of speaking figuratively. I've been burned on business deals, screwed by personal relationships, I've caved to social pressure. So yeah, I do blame people. The guy's point is laid out so that I don't need to play imagination time for him to seem more ignorant than he already does. People don't read articles, and respond how they want to; who else am I going to blame?"
csjhvm7,ganner,"I can blame ""journalists"" who reported on it in an irresponsible way. I'm actually often harder on bad journalism representing my ideological point of view than I am on the opposing side. I feel like if we are on the right side, and have facts and have good reason on our side, we don't need sloppy or deliberately stretched misinterpretations."
csjpf5e,angryshark,"Thank you! The same reasoning goes for Global Warming. Why play the hyperbole card when the facts are more than sufficient? When the journalistic falsehoods are discovered, it undermines the validity of the truth and makes the solution that much more difficult to attain."
csjo4me,adrianmonk,"If you consider the context, it makes self-immolation an even more unreasonable interpretation.During the Protestant Reformation, quite a number of Christians ([Jan de Bakker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_de_Bakker), [William Tyndale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Tyndale), [John Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rogers_\(Bible_editor_and_martyr\)), and many more) stood up for their beliefs, and as a result were arrested and executed by being burned to death.People who have a good knowledge of European or American history already know this, but Protestant Christians are of course especially aware of it, so his audience would have understood what he was saying."
csjiqpc,1IsNotTooHappy,"Agreed! Oh the irony! How many christians have taken the bible so literally? So when a pastor says he ""is willing to burn"", why not assume he is being literal ""he is willing to set himself on fire."""
csjka63,iwasapathetictroll,please don't do that. Pivoting everything into another attack is obnoxious. Sometimes you have to acknowledge that a mistake was made on your (side's) part
csjtzbi,1IsNotTooHappy,Wise words. Following that mantra would almost always promote growth and as much as my ego wants to tell you to GFY instead I will follow my spirit tells me it IS the path to follow. Thank you stranger.
csjuler,iwasapathetictroll,"thank you for posting that.People sometimes on some issues are really frustrating so I felt where you were coming from, and my post was largely a hot take of my own without any supporting arguments laid out, so I genuinely appreciate that you gave it some thought, did that leg-work instead of me, and posted this encouraging message :)"

csjpw6d,tekmonster99,Don't shit on my hilarious truth with your facts. Reddit has no room for this kind of thing.
csjr338,The_M4G,Don't ruin the dream!
csjsmik,kent_eh,"Honestly, even with the context that he intended, it's still a ridiculous statement.Especially considering that his group were the ones in history doing the burning, and being gay was among the things that could get you burned."
csk2u3h,,"People will do anything to feel like special snowflakes, even if it means playing the martyr in a country with relatively free speech."
csjkqnm,ChrisK7,"I mean... if you say you're willing to burn, I think it's you who started the hyperbole party."
csjlcwd,loveshercoffee,"The thing is though, there really isn't any context in which it would happen other than by setting himself on fire. Though, I suppose if he physically stands in the doorway to the courthouse to keep the gays from getting marriage licenses and someone sets him on fire in order to get him out of the way, then maybe it makes sense."
csjo1ub,elkab0ng,"Still, in the spirit of courtesy and generosity, I'd be happy to oblige him."
csjmatc,HealthyHotRunNAround,You and your facts. We want to see this guy light up like a Christmas tree.
csjo4us,23879723-98239874,"Well, there aren't a lot of people who speak fluent Lunatic. Lunatic is like a fifth language for me, behind English, Spanish, Latin, Quenya, and Klingon.

csjfgo1,Moruitelda,"*E: The post I was referring to suggested that Kennedy's language from the opinion (quoted below) means that sexuality is now a suspect class for the Equal Protection Clause analysis, which, OP posited, means that homosexuals would now have a right to non-discrimination. If only.*I wish you were right, as a gay rights activist, but as a lawyer, I can't let this horrible misunderstanding stand. The holding of this case does not identify sexual orientation as a suspect class. Hell, the *dicta* doesn't even identify sexual orientation as a suspect class. The fact that he said the words ""Equal Protection Clause"" do not magically have the effect that you're suggesting. Not even remotely. The Equal Protection clause analysis departs from ""rational basis"" scrutiny in *two* situations. First, as you are apparently aware, they will apply more exacting scrutiny to a law that burdens a group based upon a suspect classification (strict scrutiny for race; a more intermediate level for gender) . Second, as I suspect you may *not* be aware based upon your conclusion here, it also applies more exacting scrutiny **when the classification burdens a fundamental right.** That's clearly what Kennedy is talking about here. >And the Equal Protection Clause... prohibits this unjustified infringement of the **fundamental right** to marry.This doesn't touch on sexual orientation as a suspect class *at all*. It's not even something that you could fairly infer. A first year law student who has completed their Constitutional law course could tell you as much. So please, don't get people's hopes up by spreading this misinformation."
csjftyl,WisconsinHoosierZwei,"Thank you for writing this. This actually is really helpful in understanding the ruling. They didn't strike down same-sex marriage bans because they affected gay people, but because they affected marriage."
csjg3j5,Moruitelda,"Precisely. Basically, the analysis went like this:1. Did the government infringe... (Yes.)2. ...a fundamental right of a class? (Marriage: Yes.)3. Does the classification further a compelling government interest? (No.)4. Is the use of the classification necessary? (No.)That was basically the path to this decision. The reason that gay marriage passes this hurdle but child marriage or plural (bigamous/polygamous/polyandrous) marriage does not is that the governmental interest in protecting people from abuse and coercion in those situations is far more significant."
csji8kq,mormotomyia,which is great not only for gays but for everyone who wants to pursuit happyness. Its the American Dream
csjfm5u,,[deleted]
csjfp7x,Moruitelda,"They're really completely separate issues. I don't think that this shifts the analysis on suspect class at all; at best, this was always going to be one of the rulings we got prior to the suspect class ruling, so we're one step closer in that way of thinking. But as to the question, is there anything in this ruling that suggests that five justices are inclined to define sexual orientation as a suspect class? Not to me. Kagan would probably do it. Sotomayor almost definitely would. Kennedy might. Beyond that, I really don't know."
csjfs1f,Bibbity-boppity,"Thank you, that was bugging me. Like, how do you possibly get that from that excerpt."
csjfwbo,Moruitelda,There are a lot of people who fancy themselves legal hobbyists but don't know how to read a case. It doesn't surprise me at all that someone who doesn't know how to read a case could understand that discrimination based upon suspect classes is an Equal Protection issue and then assume that this case had a silver bullet when they saw the Equal Protection language. But if OP actually has any kind of legal training - even a year in law school - this is pretty inexcusable.
csjfym9,Rick2L,"Thank you for the information. I've been trying to figure out just that issue from the ruling, but not being a lawyer, wasn't sure. Still, a magnificent ruling."
csjgopj,Ciellon,"In the military, sexual orientation (which blankets both orientation and preference, including for oneself) was moved to be protected under our Equal Opportunity clause. As a nation, we're almost there. Usually when the military does something profound like this, the rest of the country follows suit."
csjgs83,Moruitelda,"I certainly agree that it's coming. My point is that the language from this opinion doesn't move the legal chains toward it. In terms of the suspect class analysis, this decision doesn't change one thing"
csjfr78,,Thanks for the IAAL update for all of us IANAL folks. :)
csjg1yp,,"To be fair, I took Constitutional law in my second year."
csjgfy2,Moruitelda,Oh! Interesting. It was my second semester.
csjh2fj,doomngloom80,"Dammit. Came looking for this info as soon as I saw that phrase. I knew we couldn't have won two huge victories at once, but couldn't help but hope.Thanks for the accurate info."
csjg35k,coppersocks,Spoil sport.
csjh22n,Aloil,I think you meant to write 'law' instead of 'classification'
csjha97,Moruitelda,"No, I meant to write classification. Laws that run afoul of the Equal Protection clause always do so based upon a classification. In this case, it's based upon sexuality. However, getting beyond rational basis analysis requires either that the classification be based upon a suspect class, or that the classification burden a fundamental right."
csjhfpz,Aloil,"That's much clearer, thanks."
csjg2s9,CaptainFairchild,"Solid PSA, but you may want to edit your last two sentences as it makes you come off like a condescending ass and diminishes your message."
csjg9s4,Moruitelda,"Whenever someone tries their hand at legal analysis, puts their thoughts out there like they're absolutely certain, and is dead wrong, I tend to give them a hard time. I don't want to courteously correct him; I wanted to be a little harsh so that the next time he has the inclination to post something like this, but isn't sure, he phrases it like a question.We have far too many misconceptions about the legal process from people like OP writing stuff like this, and it can do real harm. I don't mind having the conversation, but when we're talking about serious stuff like people's rights, people should be careful about how they present their guesses in a public conversation."
csjf4po,Naked-In-Cornfield,"Or does it only protect gay *marriage* specifically here? Someone please explain the ramifications of that inclusion.EDIT: See /u/Moruitelda's post just above. This ruling does not make sexual orientation a protected class.EDIT2: Poster above me originally was stating that this ruling would basically outlaw all forms of discrimination against homosexuals, which was obviously ridiculous since they deleted their comment."
csjfai4,Bifman,"It'll be argued as ""dicta."" The holding (rule) this case established is same-sex marriage, the routes they get there can be persuasive, but aren't necessarily bright line rules."
csjgcpj,Moruitelda,"> It'll be argued as ""dicta.""It's not dicta. SCOTUS did not spend even a word of this opinion on whether sexual orientation is a suspect class. The entire involvement of the Equal Protection Clause was based upon marriage's status as a fundamental right."
csjggv5,Bifman,Which is why I said it will be *argued* as dicta.
csjgn82,Moruitelda,"Maybe by people on the Internet, but it won't be presented in Courts that way. There's absolutely no indication in this *whatsoever* that suggest that the Supreme Court views sexuality as a suspect class. This won't even make a string cite in support of the argument."
csjfusn,minimim,"Courts never rule in the abstract. It applies just to this case, and they also guarantee that if similar cases come in the future, they will rule the same way they did now."
csjf4eb,Eisnel,So this ruling goes further than just marriage? All states must now recognize sexual orientation when judging discrimination?
csjfgx9,jimbo831,"Based on his wording, that's how non-lawyer me interprets it. I would be surprised, however, if we don't get one of the businesses discriminating against a gay couple cases in front of SCOTUS within the next year or two. I would imagine, in the interim, lower courts will side with the gay couples in those, based on this precedent, though."
csjg2r4,jrakosi,"Exactly this. We won't know exactly how broad this decision is until a few more cases pop up down the road, and that's alright. SCOTUS rarely makes huge decisions all at once"
csjfphp,Phonda,For marriage - yes. For other things - not quite yet. But probably in the next few years or so.

csjnb2s,Phonda,Yes but ONLY on the grounds of marriage. Which is now irrelevant due to today's ruling.
csjfzfb,xHeero,"It doesn't extend past marriage. >And the Equal Protection Clause, like the Due Process Clause, prohibits this unjustified infringement of the fundamental right to marry.That is what they specifically said. They did not use language to apply it to things other than marriage."

csjfsu0,minimim,"Courts never rule in the abstract. They are talking about just this one case, and the only thing they guarantee is that if some other case comes to them that is similar to this, they will rule in the same way (they may also punish other courts that keep sending them similar cases that were decided in the past)"

csjfagr,fireinthesky7,"It doesn't explicitly lay that out, but it sure as hell leaves the door wide open for another case confirming it."
csjf6ni,Isentrope,"It doesn't look like they assign a level of scrutiny, though. That might still come up in the future."
csjf9fr,StrictScrutiny,"This is correct; they seem to have intentionally avoided identifying a level of scrutiny at this time, since it was unnecessary to resolve this particular matter."
csjfwew,dcux,That is a ridiculously relevant username. Thanks :)
csjgex8,Moruitelda,"Restriction on fundamental rights always receives heightened scrutiny, usually strict. They didn't assign a level of scrutiny to sexuality because this opinion did not state that sexuality is a suspect class."
csjh36c,Isentrope,"It will be some level of heightened scrutiny, but no clear indication of what kind. Gender is intermediate, for instance."
csjh84x,Moruitelda,"I agree that someday, there will be heightened scrutiny. But it's not here yet. And it's not in this opinion. This opinion was based upon the burdening of fundamental rights, not a suspect classification."
csjf45v,AngryNarwal,"Ya, this extends Title VII to Sexual Orientation, does it not?"
csjgbin,Moruitelda,"No, absolutely not. OP was confused."
csjfmrd,Undeadfungas,Now does this mean Churches will loose tax exempt status if they discriminate gay people?
csjgf6p,Moruitelda,No. OP was mistaken.
csjfnyc,mmmbleach,That is huge.
csjfwse,Fuckyoucocksmooch,"It should have been solely an Equal Protection issue. The notion that the government has an affirmative obligation to recognize relationships is absurd. The notion that if the government decides to recognize relationships, it can't discriminate based on sex or sexual orientation, is not absurd."
csjexjo,Dane1414,So did they just officially extend the equal protection clause to include gays?
csjf2e4,Naked-In-Cornfield,Or did they only extend it to protect gay *marriage* specifically?
csjf9ta,WRCousCous,"I think the language about imposing a disability on gays and lesbians is the general extension of Equal Protection to gay people as a class. The unjustified infringement (of the right to marry) is the specific example of a disability imposed on the (now) protected class. This is *fantastic* from an equal rights and human rights perspective! Even fabulous, if you'll allow it :)\* edit: turns out I'm wrong about this protecting gays as a class, or 'raising' the class to the status of 'suspect' (which doesn't sound terribly promising, you must admit). I'm still sticking by my assertion that this is a fabulous decision. Please see /u/Moruitelda's excellent replies in the thread below!"
csjggfa,SerKevanLannister,"Two snaps up ""fabulous"" (remember the Wayan brothers ""Men on Film"" routine from Living Color? That show was awesome).Watching the news coverage this morning made me proud -- this is like the Loving vs Virginia decision (1967) which legalized interracial marriage. We are observing a truly historic moment. The stats that were being discussed on CNN and on Fox were amazing (and how quickly attitude haves changed) -- Republicans under the age of thirty overwhelmingly support gay marriage, which was pointed out as the presidential candidates oppose it (I think Rand Paul thinks it should be up to the states)."
csjgasn,,"They very clearly state that they are addressing the fundamental right to marry. Having said that, the reasoning used by the Court in this case could be used to argue for just such an expansion."
csjgzo6,WavesMalone,I'll allow it.
csjj4jb,Moruitelda,"> I think the language about imposing a disability on gays and lesbians is the general extension of Equal Protection to gay people as a class.It's not. The equal protection clause was invoked based upon the infringement of a fundamental right (marriage), not the suspect class status of sexuality."
csjjuse,WRCousCous,"\* Comment unchanged, but please see our lawyer friends rebuttal, which corrects my misunderstandings!-----------------------------------------------------But the infringement is predicated on a protected class. The fundamental right to marry, for example, will not be extended by this decision to (involuntary) arranged marriages, underage marriages, animals, or other such fantasy permutations conjured by the religious right.In order for a fundamental right to be infringed upon, it has to apply to a class which has standing and equal protection to other classes afforded that right. I think that the language makes it clear that the majority is treating gay and lesbians as a protected class. It would be difficult to ""impose a disability"" on a class of people that couldn't statutorily be considered a class or protected. Then again, I'm an ecologist rather than a constitutional scholar, so I'm very likely wrong :)\* edit: So, on further thinking (and reading online), it appears that people are split on whether this decision applies strictly to marriage, or can be construed in a broader sense. It seems likely that, as is often the case, SCOTUS will either issue an explanation or (as is more likely) hear another case in the future to settle that particular issue. If someone were, for example, to challenge one of the equal protection laws in cities such as Boise, Idaho (protecting hiring, housing, and other forms of discrimination) that are at odds with the state statutes, such a case might be decided and appealed up the ladder. This would afford the SCOTUS to weigh in on whether the current decision applies only to marriage and accruing benefits or more broadly."
csjlsru,Moruitelda,"> But the infringement is predicated on a protected class. But not a suspect class that gets heightened scrutiny.> The fundamental right to marry, for example, will not be extended by this decision to (involuntary) arranged marriages, underage marriages, animals, or other such fantasy permutations conjured by the religious right.That's because there's a compelling government interest there, not because sexuality is a suspect class. >In order for a fundamental right to be infringed upon, it has to apply to a class which has standing and equal protection to other classes afforded that right.You're misusing the term ""standing"" here. Any classification can be challenged; if it's a fundamental right or the classification itself is suspect, then you get heightened scrutiny. FOR INSTANCE: 1. A classification that people who wear glasses cannot drive without glasses will be constitutional because ""glasses status"" is not a suspect class, the right to drive is not fundamental, and the requirement is based upon a legitimate government interest.2. A classification that people who wear glasses cannot get married will be unconstitutional because, although ""glasses status"" is not a suspect class, the right to marry *is* fundamental and the restriction is not based upon a compelling government interest.3. A classification that black people cannot drive will be unconstitutional because although the right to drive is not fundamental, race is a suspect class and the restriction is not based upon a compelling government interest.Now the key one is this: if a classification said that *gay* people cannot drive, we don't know how the Court would analyze it. In all likelihood, it would be rational basis with bite or intermediate scrutiny. But the Court hasn't defined sexuality as a suspect class, so we don't know how it would be analyzed yet. (Incidentally, my example would likely be unconstitutional even under rational basis scrutiny since it doesn't serve a legitimate government interest.)>I think that the language makes it clear that the majority is treating gay and lesbians as a protected class.You're completely mistaken. The issue here is that the classification is touching on a fundamental right, not a suspect class. >Then again, I'm an ecologist rather than a constitutional scholar, so I'm very likely wrong :)I'm a lawyer, and you're putting in a good effort, but you are missing a few things here. The key is that the Court, after invoking the Equal Protection Clause, then talks about how marriage is a fundamental right. If it were going with the protected class reasoning, it would read something like, ""Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a classification which burdens a protected class will be subject to heightened scrutiny. Today, this Court declares that classifications on basis of sexuality are suspect, and are subject to an analysis based upon intermediate scrutiny."" The Court would then define the intermediate scrutiny standard.>This would afford the SCOTUS to weigh in on whether the current decision applies only to marriage and accruing benefits or more broadly.The language of the current opinion does not define sexuality as a suspect class. I won't be surprised when they do define it as such (probably in the fairly near future), but this decision really can't be read that way; it's quite clear that they're talking about a fundamental right analysis, not a suspect class analysis."
csjm4g3,WRCousCous,"Ok, so follow up:> The language of the current opinion does not define sexuality as a suspect class. I won't be surprised when they do define it as such (probably in the fairly near future), but this decision really can't be read that wayHow exactly can this be done? Does there have to be a case where the 'suspect class' issue is central, or can SCOTUS issue some sort of clarification without hearing a new case? I'm wondering if I'm quite wrong about that too! And thank you kindly for helping to educate us non-lawyers about how all this works. I deal with enough jargon in my own field, I appreciate it when others help us plebes to differentiate between ""protected class,"" ""suspect class,"" and ""class is out for the summer."""
csjryrv,Moruitelda,"> Does there have to be a case where the 'suspect class' issue is central, or can SCOTUS issue some sort of clarification without hearing a new case?It'll be a separate lawsuit, where some law or governmental action is challenged as discriminatory. The attorney for the plaintiffs will argue that they should be considered a suspect class for the same reasons that race and gender are. The Court will basically be forced to make new law. The Supreme Court cannot simply publish an announcement of what scrutiny is afforded to gay people (if any) as a suspect class. An announcement of that type, made without an actual dispute before the Court, is called an advisory opinion. Article III of the United States Constitution prohibits federal courts created under Article III from issuing advisory opinions by requiring that there be a ""case or controversy."" >I deal with enough jargon in my own field, I appreciate it when others help us plebes to differentiate between ""protected class,"" ""suspect class,"" and ""class is out for the summer.""My pleasure. I hate to see misconceptions about the law, so I try to correct them when I can."
csjf5f7,Eisnel,That's what I'm wondering. Does this affect how all states have to treat discrimination claims?
csjfaah,YungSnuggie,that'll be contingent upon further judicial review of this decision but i could see a court interpreting it in that fashion
csjg9sk,Sadpanda596,"Seems to me that it probably will. Have to see how that plays out though, my understanding is that equal protection clause jurisprudence related to sexual orientation is one giant clusterfuck of various contradictions right now."
csjj5hw,Moruitelda,"No. It's one step on the path toward that, but the legal framework isn't changed a bit. This does not make sexuality a suspect class."
csjfm05,walk_through_this,"Wait, does it mean we can still discriminate against homosexuals who don't want to get married? Come to think of it, that wouldn't much different from my parents' approach once I got out of college...(Of course this is all me kidding. I kid. I'm a kidder.)"
csjfurb,Margatron,[No they didn't. Read this comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3b6zln/supreme_court_legalizes_gay_marriage/csjfgo1)
csjg0gy,,"The equal protection clause has always included gays. What's not clear is whether laws burdening their liberty are subject to strict scrutiny or some lesser form of scrutiny and, from what I've seen from this opinion so far, that question is still unanswered. But the EPC includes any classification you can think of. People with glasses vs. people without. Dog owners vs. cat owners. So long as a distinction can be drawn, it is subject to equal protection scrutiny; the thing is, most things are just subject to rational basis scrutiny, which just asks whether its a conceivably reasonable distinction to draw."
csjj7g9,Moruitelda,"Nailed it. But to put a finer point on your nail, this decision does not in any way suggest that classifications on basis of sexuality are subject to heightened scrutiny. The Equal Protection analysis was significant because the right to marriage is a fundamental right."
csjjbmw,,"Thanks. I haven't read it yet, so that's good to know."

csjgydz,pappypapaya,We're coming for you Indiana.
csjfq8d,Duckie1080,I've only read over the opinion once but the strong language used by Kennedy applying Equal Protection to gays and lesbians makes it seem like he is begging for a new discrimination case to come before the case so the protection can be applied towards other types of discrimination towards them. It's not necessarily worth much but I am a lawyer.
csjg971,nuha_tezcatlipoca,"The equal protection clause should have already included gays. The 14th amendment says anyone born or naturalized in the states is entitled to all rights under the constitution. Also, Gays have been a protected class since 1964. http://www.attorneys.com/discrimination/what-are-protected-classes/. Was the law preventing gay marriage illegal to begin with??"
csjh7vz,ponybuttz,"The 14th amendment already applied to ""the gays"". It has always applied to everyone. ""... nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; ... "" Note the ""any person"""

I'm sad to see the conservative judges voting with their homophobia on what is, in my opinion, such a clear-cut ruling. No matter your opinions on gayness there is no way you can, with a clear mind, deny that barring gays from marrying was unequal treatment and a denying due process!

csjh9o1,steckums,I hope so! It's my birthday :)
csjlv0s,thomas_dahl,Happy birthday.
csjhajt,,My law firm has proposed it to our representatives.
csjhmf8,Master_Of_Knowledge,Your lawn firm can't make holidays.
csjhocb,mardish,Oh man you're going to be so embarrassed when you realize how representative democracy works.
csjhnxd,,"No, but we can suggest to our representatives (senators, congresspeople, both state and federal) that *they* do so..."
csjhxmy,Master_Of_Knowledge,I'm pretty sure they don't give a shit about some lawn firms opinion....
csjhzfh,,"Haha, lawn firm. I'm putting that on the sign. ""WE DO GRASS LAW!""Actually, at least one representative does, but that's because his dad's firm is my immediate neighbor and we sometimes have lunch together. He *won't* do it (wrong party, wouldn't get reelected) but it's not like he dismisses everything I say out of hand."
csjia83,Master_Of_Knowledge,Lol. Just because you may bug him enough that he has lunch once and while while trying to escape doesn't mean he would take anything you think to heart or consideration. You're not nearly as important as you think you are son.
csjnede,,"""Lol"" we knew each other as attorneys before he was elected. I wouldn't say he's a close and personal friend, but we have a good relationship.Then again, he's just a Congressman. I wouldn't say I have the ear of the powerful, and he's certainly not going to propose this because I asked, but don't be so cynical about the power of representative democracy!"
csjhot9,Raustan,"You may be surprised what little it takes to make a holiday. Sure it may not be a federal holiday, but neither is national donut day and that's still bomb ass."
csjhdcw,zweischeisse,National Gay Day?
csjhi7c,Asmodicus,Nation Day of Equality or Equality Day.
csjhjda,tpdi,"Probably pure coincidence, but it's one week after Juneteenth, the annniversary of the emancipation of slavery in Texas."
csjhlut,fuckitimatwork,FUCK I missed juneteenth!
csjikzc,The_Venerable_Pippin,"And it's my anniversary, hooray for marriage!! It's wild to think how far this has come in the five years since my wife and I said our vows. Now no matter where you live or who you love you can say ""I do"" and ain't no one gonna stop you. This country just became a better place to be."
csjhbwo,buShroom,I made a WhiteHouse.gov [petition!](http://wh.gov/i0JTa)
csjn1ka,CAredditBoss,It's my birthday today. I'm not gay but I support this ruling 100%. Awesome news.

csjuhoo,HowAboutShutUp,Well we have May Day so why not Gay Day
csjh4hv,Freqd-with-a-silentQ,"It's my high school girl friends birthday. She actually come out as a lesbian since college. I approve of this being the holiday, she'd be thrilled."
csjj8x5,sorator,"Well, it's already in Pride month"
csjjtio,SamMan2k,Let's make June 26th National Gay Day.
csjn41v,,National Gay Day!
csk19hb,LithePanther,It's the day the gays have a kiki
csjhllh,Master_Of_Knowledge,Lol. Come on... Don't be fucking ridiculous.
csjhp3b,fuckitimatwork,we could called it G-Day
csjg4tw,Lost_Magi,It is the evening before San Francisco pride every year.
csjkh3o,G-Solutions,"We are a food vendor at the SF gay pride parade. Last time we went when they made it legal there were millions of people who turned out, but apparently gay people bring their own lunch so we lost money on the deal. You better show up ready to celebrate this year gay people, or else I'll vote for the craziest Republican on the ticket next election, don't test me!"
csjhp6u,WWE-RAWnian,"Same in Houston. That's right, a Texas city has a huge pride celebration."
csjmc4j,SometimesY,Houston is one of the most gay friendly cities in the US so it makes sense.
csjjmsh,nk1992,Preppin' for a party.
csjl6hi,votenanocratic,Minneapolis too.
csjole7,elkab0ng,Now the entire country has something to be proud of on that day.
csjg1bv,XxsquirrelxX,It would be fucking amazing if we made June 26th National LGBT Rights Day.
csjgtm9,Senecatwo,One more day a year of holiday pay? Yes please.
csjgjka,Zoythrus,"Or, better yet, if we stopped the practice of giving one group a ""day"" or ""month"". True equality is when the discriminated group becomes just as ""normal"" as the majority, not when given special attention."
csjgzrt,XxsquirrelxX,"I like to think of those as temporary. It's meant to raise awareness to their plight. But it's also a celebration of culture. Hispanic Heritage month is about their culture, much like how the 4th of July has basically become one big American cultural party."
csjh76q,Vanetia,There's a Hispanic Heritage Month?We just celebrate Cinco De Mayo and call it a Hispanic holiday. Like St Patty's day for the Irish.
csjh2nm,nigel_uno,"but july 4th is different bc we are all American, and not necessarily all hispanic."
csjhmbi,Zoythrus,"I think that the 4th of July (which is a celebration of the nation's formation) is a bit different from celebrating any one group - especially in America, where ""all men are created equal."""
csjpmgc,XxsquirrelxX,"I like how you put ""all men are created equal"" in quotes. Our country really needs to look at that and think ""Hmmm, maybe waiting so long to give these people rights wasn't the right thing to do?"""
csjqybc,Zoythrus,"To be fair, it wasn't until recently that it wasn't deemed a mental disorder."
csjr2ko,XxsquirrelxX,It shouldn't have ever been a mental disorder.
csjrf0m,Zoythrus,Anything that has both genetic and psychological components are always difficult to understand and classify.
csjfrkt,Ah_Q,I just got a marriage equality boner.
csjg5q7,,goosbumps. and tears.
csjg64e,,"I suspect that was the rationale for doing this today. But I work in advertising, and that's just the sort of ""coincidence"" I work hard on creating."
csjimdv,SushiAndWoW,"Obergefell, huh?In German, Oberbefehl would mean ""Supreme Command""... :)"
csjje10,Heyy_Brother,But can gay marriages melt steal beams?
csjfr9h,,"I really respect that man because while I am probably far left of him politically, he appears to be somebody who will put personal opinions aside when it comes to fundamental rights. When he ruled about citizens united and voting rights, he was also quite clear that his objection is not that laws protecting voting rights or aiming to prevent corruption are necessarily a bad idea, but rather that the government needs to do this properly, with constitutional amendments if need be.The entire idea with these things are that there should be gridlocked separation of powers to prevent any once branch of government from ceasing control, and if there is a recognised problem with how that is presently being done ( i.e gerrymandering of voting districts and voting suppression laws) then the correct way to address the matter is to amend the constitution.It seems very unlikely that Kennedy would be opposed to reforms that would strengthen minorities' right to vote, but it needs to be done properly."
csji0zb,dgrant92,Kennedy seems pretty squared away on civil rights issues.
csjs0f9,happylookout,"Though his vote is the most important (being the swing between 4 conservative and liberal on this issue), he's only written the opinions because the most senior justice writes the opinion when the Chief Justice is in the dissenting side.Roberts is the Chief Justice, and Scalia is the only more senior justice than Kennedy."
csjuxfz,Ah_Q,">he's only written the opinions because the most senior justice writes the opinion when the Chief Justice is in the dissenting side.That's not quite right. If the C.J. is not in the majority, the most senior justice in the majority *assigns who writes the opinion*. But he/she will not necessarily write the opinion himself/herself."

csjfq3m,Limond,Thanks for that link. I was making a cheap joke so I deleted my comment. Don't actually know much of anything about the justices.
csjf6cv,thisdude415,"To limit his legacy to Windsor and Obergefell does Kennedy a tremendous disservice. He also wrote the majority opinion in four other huge gay rights cases...1996, Romer v. Evans (gays may bring discrimination suits in Colorado)2003, Lawrence v. Texas (which found laws criminalizing gay sex unconstitutional) 2010, Christian Legal Society v. Martinez, (school policies requiring student orgs to not discriminate against gay students is constitutional)2013, United States v. Windsor, (Overturning DOMA)"
csjfehb,pyrespirit,"I may disagree with a lot of Kennedy's politics, but I have a great amount of respect for him. He always demonstrates himself, unlike the other conservative members of the supreme court, to be willing to rule based upon the constitution and the merits of an argument, and not upon his own ideology."
csjg99m,,"Kennedy, the first gay supreme court justice."
csjhs6o,TheManInsideMe,Kennedy has supplanted Notorious RBG as my favorite Justice. That last paragraph is going to be remembered on monuments and shit.
csjiolu,,"And that *Windsor* opinion is why this is not even a tiny surprise that the court ruled this way. In *Windsor*, he literally put the fucking language into the opinion to set up the precedent to rule on this case when the time came."
csjj6fa,Duxal,"Yeah, they definitely ""ducked"" it with *Hollingsworth* but at the time only twelve (I think?) states had same-sex marriage so they were probably not willing to create a second *Roe*."
csjlare,,"Exactly. They could tell where the winds were blowing on this issue, and they wanted to make sure that when they were forced to make a concrete ruling on this, they would rule this way. They just wanted public opinion to shift slightly more."
csjlg4g,,"It bothers me how Kennedy is single handedly the most important man in the whole equality battle but he is not getting recognition across all those celebrating. ""WE DID IT"" says everyone on the snap story. What did you do? This was done by one amazing man."

csjg2y2,,[deleted]
csjk7m8,futatorius,It's a very old word actually.
csjgvp0,shaboogie-bop,Nor is there any argle-bargle.
csjfi88,swordbeam,"No, but this was in Scalia's dissent.. ""The opinion is couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic,"" he writes. ""If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: ‘The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,' I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.""What a bag of dicks"
csjf4pr,027915,Scalia is just the worst. He got mean and personal afterward.https://twitter.com/joshgreenman/status/614435332889686016
csjlely,KillYourCar,Scalia should be happy. The definition of marriage has been broadened. Now he can go fuck himself legally in all 50 states.
csk3r7x,DudemanReloaded,I think he'll also need to get to a burn clinic too.
csjig7z,column5,That isn't accurate? Seems pretty accurate to me. It is just as simple as saying that most CEOs are white men and generally serve their own interests.
csjijbo,027915,No one said anything about accuracy one way or another. It's just a dickhead thing to say. Only an asshole would make a reference to Nazi Germany in the legalization of gay marriage.
csjiy8e,column5,"He was making a valid critique on the fact that they aren't ruling on the law itself, but rather (as he put it) ""the spirit of the age"". If you want to change the law, change the damn law. Don't have a panel of 9 people rewrite it without much (if any) regard to how it was written. I can't imagine it would be that hard to create a constitutional amendment which outlines the definition of marriage. The real issue I have with this ruling is that they will not apply this interpretation of Equal Protection elsewhere -- this was the law being interpreted for a specific social cause.Then we have Roberts..""But this court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us,"" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in dissent.Who, just yesterday, determined that the law as written wasn't what they really meant."
csjjaij,027915,"Valid points, to be sure, but you're still glossing over the fact he referred to it as a ""putsch,"" which is spiteful and incredibly poor taste."
csjjm0k,column5,"I'll agree. I probably wouldn't have used that language or his analogy, I think it is tired and overused."
csjfvls,kotorfan04,"Hey, what did Justice Scalia say to the happily married gay couple?""Care to stand with me on the wrong side of history?""Joke shamelessly stolen from a They Might Be Giants concert."
csjesc8,Ah_Q,"Somewhat hilariously, many of the district court judges who declared state bans on gay marriage unconstitutional under *Windsor* relied on Scalia's interpretation of that decision . . . as described in his *Windsor* dissent."
csjszz4,Shashakiro,"His Lawrence dissent (from 2003) is even more compelling, and hilariously contains a quite well-reasoned argument that if one accepts Lawrence as controlling, it's hard to see any rational basis for prohibiting same-sex marriage. It even undermines today's Roberts dissent (which Scalia joined), which claims that there's some distinction between the ""definitional"" nature of the same-sex marriage bans and, say, interracial marriage bans; Scalia pointed out in his Lawrence dissent that legally defining marriage as between a man and a woman is just a ""nicer way"" of expressing moral disapproval of homosexuality.Fun fact: all four circuit courts that ruled in favor of marriage equality cited a Scalia dissent in support of their reasoning."
csjeuzw,mortarnpistol,That's pure applesauce.
csjeqcq,tommyjohnpauljones,"Thomas.Nope, I don't think he's ever written an opinion."
csjeve9,SexyOldManSpaceJudo,He writes quite a few opinions; he just never speaks in court. It's literally been years since he's asked a question during a hearing.
csjfeum,lolmonger,"He views the Oral Arguments as unncessary theatrics, and everyone knows it. The Justices are hardly swayed on issues they are literally always thinking about in light of decades of study and case history, and if they are, they're not going to lay their decision making process out in Oral for the sake of letting everyon anticipate Supreme Court decisions as an ersatz for policy making.That's why Thomas simply prefers to keep his discussions written, cited, and silent to the court hearings."
csjiyb6,barlister,"He's also not smart, and never sways from his ideology. He always votes the ultra-conservative vote. He doesn't need case history, and only needs interns for blowjobs."
csjj6u0,lolmonger,">He's also not smartI assure you, the people sitting on this Court and almost all past ones are far smarter than you or I, regardless of their ideology and the sentiments of the time.>never sways from his ideology. He always votes the ultra-conservative vote.totally irrelevant to his intelligence.I suppose Ginsburg is a dumb-dumb because she never sways from her ideology and only votes the ultra-progressive vote.>only needs interns for blowjobs1) unsubstantiated slander2) I thought it was no big deal with Clinton, what gives?"
csjl4rs,barlister,Read his dissent. I assure you that just because he was appointed multiple times up the ladder doesn't mean he is smart. Crafty yes. I don't care if he gets blowjobs. He does no research and never refers to case law and always follows Republican Party lines. Ginsberg is articulate and at least refers to actual cases and laws. Thomas is an embarrassment.
csjfhaw,,He is... *The Silent Judge.*

csjg1jo,anakinmcfly,What about a gay face?
csjgaec,hawkian,"He did. They all wrote one. Granted, his is of this nature: >""'The nature of marriage is that, through its enduring bond, two persons together can find other freedoms, such as expression, intimacy, and spirituality.' Really? Who ever thought that intimacy and spirituality [whatever that means] were freedoms? And if intimacy is, one would think Freedom of Intimacy is abridged rather than expanded by marriage. Ask the nearest hippie.""I'm not paraphrasing or anything. He quoted that excerpt from the majority opinion and followed it with ""Really?"" edit: You may very well have meant he didn't write the originally quoted opinion, my bad."

csjuh54,tehlemmings,If I think through the issue I'll understand why he can be more of a clown? I dont get it.Where's the long visioned threat to America here?
csjv84i,tony7914,The court is supposed to interpret law not write it. Perhaps it doesn't matter to you if the court does the legislative branches work but it does to me.
csjx5vq,BKachur,It is the court's job to interpret the constitution though. The put gay marriage under equal protection of the 14th. That is squarely in their wheelhouse.The legislative check is to write it into the constitution or bring up another case to the court.
csjxhsn,tehlemmings,"This sounds likely to turn into a semantics argument. Ultimately, from how I understand it, their job is at its core to approve or reject a given appeal. The outcomes of which will define laws going forward just by the nature of the act. One something is deemed legal or illegal, it sets the precedent for future cases.On one hand, that's what they did here.On the other, you could claim that by doing so they're writing the law. But you could also that's indirectly their explicit job, to write the final version of a law that's been debated up from the lower courts to them. They're the ones who are supposed to give the final say. By the very nature of the act, every decision they make writes a law.Fuck if I know where the line is drawn. I can see both sides of the issue"

csjfdct,ResonantOne,glorious and *fabulous* I think you mean.
csjfpd1,,"Finally the progress we've been waiting for. Honestly, why do we even need congress anymore?"
csjfxuw,ResonantOne,"Yeah, I think it was Ted Cruz that was complaining about the court ""legislating from the bench"" and that they should run for election if they want to pass laws.My only thought was that is the whole point of the Supreme Court...to check the ability of backwards morons to demean the lives of people their beliefs don't agree with."
csji88z,,"Right. So let's just dispense with Congress altogether, I say. Too backwards, doesn't do anything. Lower approval rating than *bedbugs*."
csjhtup,tony7914,"The purpose of the court is to interpret the law not write it, the legislative branch in our system is supposed to be the only branch with the power to write and pass laws.We can see today that is no longer the case in America."
csjhztk,bluedreams23,"Yes, that is one purpose. However, the Supreme Court has alway's been considered a counter-majoritarian branch. This means that one of it's duties is to keep the big guys from oppressing the small guys. Furthermore, this is a reasonable interpretation of the equal protection clause."
csji8h1,Mmmslash,"They didn't make a law. They ruled that banning same-sex marriage was unconstitutional.That is literally the job of the Supreme Court, to interpret and uphold the constitution."
csjvdan,tony7914,There's nothing in the Constitution that guarantees same sex marriages any more than traditional what they did with this ruling is remove the legislative branch from the equation.
csjzzka,Mmmslash,"Wrong.Let's take a look at the 14th Amendment. ------------------------------Section 1: ""**All persons born or naturalized in the United States**^[1] , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. **No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States**^[2] ; **nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law**^[3] ; **nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws**^[4] .""-------------------------I bolded the important bits that some folks seem to miss.Let's break this down!1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States - **This seems pretty clear to me. This means everyone, regardless of race, creed, sexual orientation, hair color, anything**.2. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States - **This also seems clear. No state is allowed to pass legislation that that attempts to deny rights to folks just because they are different. We're all Americans**.3. nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law - **This is the Due Process Clause. I hope everyone is familiar with this, but it means that the State must respect all legal rights of American citizens. And if everyone born or naturalized in America, regardless of orientation, is American...** 4. nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws - **And here's the rub. That's exactly what banning same-sex marriage is. It's the systematic denial of equal rights and opportunities granted to you by the Constitution as your right as an American. Regardless of whatever religious institutions may be relevant, marriage is a State benefit - if you do not agree, please consult this long, detailed list of all the different ways that marriage legally changes your life**: **[Marriage Rights and Benefits](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/marriage-rights-benefits-30190.html)**.So, in summary, this is exactly the job of the Supreme Court. They exist to prevent unconstitutional laws - like the denial of equal rights to Americans because they don't follow the traditional idea of marriage. I find the entire argument of ""It was going to happen anyway, they should have waited for Congress"" to be one of the most narrow-minded, cruel, useless things ever expressed. Ignoring the fact that the only duty of the Supreme Court is to rule on what is and is not constitutional, the idea that somehow a Minority is going to be protected by the Majority in Congress is absurd. When was the last time Congress did this? I'll remind you - It was 1920, with the 19th amendment, granting the right to women to vote. We're five years shy of a century since the Majority did anything substantial for Minority Rights. This is a travesty, and we should be ashamed.Oh, and also there was that whole [Loving v. Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loving_v._Virginia) thing. You know, that time the SCOTUS ruled that you could not ban marriages simply because they had the audacity to love someone of another skin color? That's called precedence. We're living in the future now, and many people have been waiting for decades to be given their constitutional right - the right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness, as is entitled to all Americans.One Love, folks."

csjgp9o,Anivair,Largely that's why we didn't see a push from the anti-gay-marriage people to take it to the supreme court: because there was a very real possibility that they'd lose and be told to shove off.
csjh5v2,GringodelRio,"It was pretty much certain. I don't think the Constitution could have been clearer on this unless it said ""and the gays can marry."""
csjqdn1,Anivair,"Well, you're right. that said, the idea might not have had the same supreme court traction at various times in history, but I think there was no question at all this time."
csjqsrw,GringodelRio,"It certainly required people who can read and be willing to apply what they read despite social norms. It could have passed a long time ago, technically. But post Millennium was the only time it would have gotten huge public support."

csjr8kt,yosemighty_sam,"No, prohibition of any kind is a fool's errand. You cant stop drug abuse by making it illegal. Decades of failed drug wars across the globe have proven that. It's a medical problem, not a criminal problem. Portugal has decriminalized all drugs, and its been a massive success. The number of addicts getting help has skyrocketed while the number of new abusers has gone down. Without the stigma and fear of arrest people who need help are getting it. No reason whatsoever we wouldn't see the same success in every other country."
csjrqwr,GringodelRio,You can decriminalize (or misdemeanorize) possession while criminalizing manufacturing.
csjxadm,yosemighty_sam,"Nah, better to legalize and regulate manufacture. That would improve quality and therefore safety of the drugs, elliminate the black market and all the violence that comes with it, and provide tax revenue all at the same time.

csjj47q,pizzabyAlfredo,that's EXACTLY what they meant.

csjjqn9,ladderwalker,"What if someone wanted to marry a robot? Social justice warriors, unite!"
csjmdlf,GringodelRio,"Ah, Reddit. Total and complete misunderstanding of what social justice is."
csk0g4q,ladderwalker,"Agreed, if reddit knew anything about social justice my reply would have a million points by now."
csk47na,,"Well, children, dead people, animals, plants, rocks, and machines aren't considered capable of consent. Animals, plants, rocks, and machines aren't protected by the constitution. You have to be able to sign a marriage license, and dead people, animals, plants, rocks and machines can't sign, so that would be hard. Plus, the same wouldn't be able to initiate a divorce action, so it would impossible to be divorced.But if you want to marry a rock, I really wouldn't care. I guess then you can visit the rock in a hospital, and when you die, they'd get your estate, but since a rock doesn't have standing to file a legal action your pension would probably refuse to give it to them. The rock really couldn't sue. I don't think a rock has the ability to feel violated. Plus, there is the whole age thing. You can't tell the age of a sedimentary rock by electron dating, so it would be hard to confirm that the rock is old enough. And a igneous rock can be formed in a short timespan, so we'd have to test it to make sure it was old enough....I'm all for rock marriage rights, but we'd definitely have to find an argument for ability to consent, and deal with the age stuff. If you can give me some ideas we'll set up /r/rockrights and start the campaign."
csk7jcf,ladderwalker,"I think consent is a mute point. Kids don't give consent to being born. Ok thats pretty messed up even for me one of the most politically correct people out there. I'm trying not to be judgmental of the pedophiles but boy its not easy. OK I think I cracked the code. This might be controversial. Figure out away to take aborted fetuses and bring them to full term and birth them and give them to the pedophiles. The aborted child doesn't get to have consent because it's a woman's right to choose, and obviously she chose to kill it and any of its rights. Now rocks and dead people are pretty much the same thing. They don't care if they are married or not. All they have to do is exsist.Animals, Plants, and machines can already be bought and sold like slaves, so marriage would be a step up from slavery right?Also robots could have consent programmed into themSomething tells me I won't be getting gold for this.

They're the highest court in the land. They're appointed for life specifically with the intention that they'll make a determination that is truly beneficial for the country, not because it will look good in an election next year (like happens with the executive and legislative branches). The legislative branch drafts the laws, the executive branch approves and enforces. the judicial determines their legality. Often the Supreme Court is tasked with reading between the lines if you will because the laws are written vaguely, they have to try and determine what the intent of the law is, not necessarily the specific wording. It's all checks and balances, and it takes time."

So this is it. The argument is over and it is going to stay this way. I'm happy."
csk29b7,DidiGodot,"How badass must it feel to say, ""It is so ordered"" and then slam your gavel down like a bamf.Today's decision is certainly worth celebrating, but at the same time, the Supreme Court Justices only did exactly what I expect them to do... their jobs. The outcome is fantastic, but the decision is just common sense. That said, they still deserve respect for being able to withhold any biases they may have, and make an objective decision based on the law. Anyone who disagrees with their decision should take a hard look at their motives and beliefs and ask themselves why they are so strongly opposed to same-sex marriage, and how they rationalize the hypocrisy of denying the right to marry in a country that espouses equality and freedom. If you are Christian and you have a problem with this decision, just be happy that you live a country that upholds not just gay peoples' right to get married, but your right to not like it. Just don't confuse your right to disagree with it, for the right to take away the rights of others.America is not Christian nor did Christians invent marriage. Besides, I was raised Christian, I've heard the preachings about loving others, forgiveness, tolerance, and so on. Anyone who cherry picks pieces of the Bible to support their prejudice is simultaneously trampling on the (arguably) more important lessons therein. I'm proud of America today. I have no doubt that this will be remembered years from now as a great step forward for our country and humanity. I hope the majority of religious and conservative people who have been/are opposed to same sex marriage can accept this change with the loving acceptance they sing about on Sundays.Freedom, equality, and justice for ALL."
csk39ia,spankythang503,"Yeah, like *Roe v. Wade* ended any disagreements about abortion."
csk3cd0,SAugsburger,I think that the court majority 2 years ago thought that their prior ruling would have settled the issue and that they wouldn't need to revisit it at all. Most federal district courts pretty much rejected state bans left and right after the SCOTUS made their precedent. If not for a few holdouts that defied the SCOTUS decision I imagine that the court would just deny any appeals to override lower courts rubber stamped earlier SCOTUS precedent. Unless a SCOTUS justice feels that they want to change their decision rehearing the case seems pointless unless there were states that defied the SCOTUS precedent.
csjep99,KingPingus,"Wow, ""Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness"" there is so much humanity in this ruling."

csjhskd,Bullstang,"But the thing about being a sexual minority is that there are very few of us, and in certain places it's very taboo. So you have to stay in the closet, with no one to talk to, no one to share these feelings that you know are different from most everyone else. So loneliness is one of the most common words that comes to mind for me when you talk about the oppression if gay people."
csjkdrw,Philoso4,"Do you think this decision does anything to address the taboo nature of sexual-minority relationships?Don't get me wrong, I think this decision is long overdue, but I can still see life as a gay person in rural-Georgia to be pretty isolating, regardless of marriage equality"
csjkwhg,flourykettle,"Nobody is saying that today's decision solves everything at once.What people are celebrating is that this is a big step forward.One day, gay marriage will be as common and accepted as interracial marriage.

csjkl6x,flimflambam,"I mean, yes, there is. However, it's not like it's ""marriage"" or ""alone"" in this life. The sentence is dramatic when it doesn't need to be."
csjlaf6,KingPingus,I am really back and forth about this. It is a legal document so it does seem a tad out of place but the issue itself is very human. Hard for one person to decide...
csjhf0t,willswim4pizza,And there shouldn't be. That's the problem.
csjhiyn,KingPingus,How so?
csjhqzy,willswim4pizza,"The rule of law is not supposed to be made or interpreted in this fashion. Law is cold, hard, and factual.All of the ""humanity"" in their ruling does nothing but undermine their cause and their votes. Sure, right now it's great...but in fifty years when people look back on the decisions and read the rulings...they're going to look really strange.A lot of people are happy about this ruling, but in a lot of ways it is really messed up. Read the opposing justices comments and actually listen to what they're saying and you'll get a glimpse into why.The problem is that this issue has become so polarized by politicians that the actual legality of it has been lost. Everyone thinks that just because people aren't in favor of a federal ruling on gay marriage that you dislike gays and aren't behind ""gay rights"". That's far from the case."
csjiyg7,SushiAndWoW,"> but in fifty years when people look back on the decisions and read the rulings...Oh yes - because we shake our heads and look back on the Declaration of Independence with dismay, when instead of being a dry legal text, it uses wording such as:*We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, ...*"
csjo52n,iyja,"Genuinely curious about one thing, why didn't they use this principle to free all the slaves immediately after this was drafted? Even the 'evil' English in Somersett's case declared slavery illegal in England and Wales in 1772. Why did it take until 1863 for the emancipation proclamation to finally come in the United States?"
csjql3w,SelfimmolationPride,"Because when it says all ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, ...""It means white men who own land. Women didn't get rights until the 1900's and the emancipation proclamation is over blown what it did for blacks in America. There was still 100 years more of persecution before blacks were given more rights. Before that with Jim Crow laws they were considered 3/5th of a white male."
csjrfvn,iyja,Interesting. So men literally meant just males? Then wouldn't it be contradictory since it's not self-evident anymore *when* it has to be expanded multiple times to include more rights that the drafters never originally intended in the first place?
csk1frn,SelfimmolationPride,"In the context of back when the article was written, yes. That's why it has been such a huge struggle to give rights to minority peoples. Traditional thinkers and old white men who use to hold the power and their subordinates have always been a huge roadblock. Thankfully America has many diverse thinkers. Not to mention government can interpret the laws and rights different ways depending on the democratic process or popular opinion. America has changed a great deal since its inception."
csjuduk,climbrbro,Hence the need for judicial interpretation to make literal intention relevant to time and culture.
csk956i,SushiAndWoW,"> So men literally meant just males?It meant ""men"" rather than ""negroids"". Blacks were considered similar to humans, but categorically lesser."
csjjrpy,jbisinla,"No, the law IS made to be interpreted in that fashion. Law is the statutory embodiment of rights, either clearly defined or left to the states or individual citizens themselves, as the Constitution makes clear, ""to secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.""What the justices did today was explain that the statutory conditions infringed on these rights, and overturned those laws.Which is exactly what they're supposed to do."
csjkqe4,themanlnthesuit,Exactly. Their job is to interpret the law of the land. Not read it back like mindless first circuit judges.
csjk11a,blorg,"In fifty years this is going to look EXACTLY like the civil rights movement, I guarantee you. It is a historic moment for equality in the United States."
csjhupi,KingPingus,That would make sense in a ruling about a more black and white argument. But this is a very human issue so the only way to really approach it is with rhetoric like this.
csjicog,willswim4pizza,"It's a human issue to the average person the street. For these justices (and many in the legal world), it is a very legal and technical issue.In this case, forcing every state in the country to legally alter their definition of marriage is one of the technical legal issues that had to be addressed. And that's what just happened. Our federal government just told every single state in the union that this term is now defined how the federal government says when marriage was previously defined on a state-by-state basis.Is that legal? Should it be legal? What is the legal precedent to force states to alter their definitions?Those are just some of the technical issues that this ruling really is about. And the dissenting viewpoint towards this ruling is that formal legal precedents and technicalities that were long established have just been trampled by this ruling.Again, it's not really about gay rights. It's about how this ruling is going to change legal precedent going forward forever. In future rulings, justices and judges will actually reference this case and say ""this was done here, so we now have a legal precedent to apply the same theory to our ruling in this specific case as well""."
csjjxgc,jbisinla,"> In future rulings, justices and judges will actually reference this case and say ""this was done here, so we now have a legal precedent to apply the same theory to our ruling in this specific case as well"".God forbid they use this reading to expand the rights of the individual over historic and cruel religiously motivated discriminatory laws.Who knows how the American public could handle all the additional freedom."
csjixtc,tadcalabash,"There's definite legal grounds for this decision, specifically the 14th amendments equal protection clause.I too was a little surprised at how flowery the written decision was, but that shouldn't negate the firm logical footing of the decision."
csjishr,KingPingus,"Yeah that makes sense, I was raised very progressive so personally I see this as a must. But I do understand that this is forcing it upon others who do not believe in it. So who knows what will happen?"
csjswgw,Avant_guardian1,Laws are meant to serve humanity and society. Not the other way around.The dissenting options show how much law has become a weapon the powerful use against the voter. That's not how the social contract works.

csjemqv,moorsonthecoast,"From the first of four dissents, this one by Roberts:>Although the policy arguments for extending marriageto same-sex couples may be compelling, the legal argumentsfor requiring such an extension are not. The fundamentalright to marry does not include a right to makea State change its definition of marriage. And a State'sdecision to maintain the meaning of marriage that haspersisted in every culture throughout human history canhardly be called irrational. In short, our Constitution doesnot enact any one theory of marriage. The people of aState are free to expand marriage to include same-sexcouples, or to retain the historic definition.> Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary stepof ordering every State to license and recognize same-sexmarriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and Ibegrudge none their celebration. But for those who believein a government of laws, not of men, the majority's approachis deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sexmarriage have achieved considerable success persuadingtheir fellow citizens—through the democratic process—toadopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers haveclosed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriageas a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue fromthe people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage,making a dramatic social change that much moredifficult to accept. Prediction: Downvoted into oblivion, by a 5-4 margin. EDIT: Added clarifying information to first line."

Scalia's dissent actually claims this was a ""putsch"" that poses a threat to American democracy. Like most of his other recent decisions, and like Thomas' similar opinion (in his dissent) that slavery did not implicate the dignity of slaves, his words reveal him to be not a serious person, let alone one with the temperament to serve on any court. People used to pretend he was so intellectually rigorous, but he's not. He's a fucking joke, who demeans the bench with his ridiculous rants. There is a reason the Supreme Court is supposed to be separate from, or above political concerns. Judges are there to resolve disputes, not fan the flames. Scalia is an irresponsible, political hack. Occasionally, he gets one right, the way a blind hog occasionally gets an acorn. But he won't be remembered for those decisions. He'll be remembered for ""jiggery-pokery"".

csjh0hn,bcdm,"I just read Scalia's dissent. The entire first half of his argument is stupid - he basically says that courts have no place ever getting involved in this debate. Quote, ""When the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868, every State limited marriage to one man and one woman, and no one doubted the constitutionality of doing so.""Got it? Since the 14th was ratified in 1868, we must respect the social mores of the times in which it was ratified. Simple, right?*Except that Loving v. Virgina already proved that idea wrong almost 50 years ago, you simpering moron.*He ends his first half by saying that the rest of the Justices aren't qualified to represent the country, since they're from the coasts and went to Ivy League schools, complete with the bizarre assertion that Californians aren't Westerners. (?)His second half just descends into gibberish, complete with sentences like, ""The opinion is couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic."" (Pot, meet kettle.); ""And if intimacy is [a freedom], one would think Freedom of Intimacy is abridged rather than expanded by marriage. Ask the nearest hippie."" (???!?); and my favorite, ""Rights, we are told, can “rise . . . from a better informed understanding of how constitutional imperatives define a liberty that remains urgent in our own era.” (Huh?...)""That's right, a Supreme Court Justice just said, ""Huh?"" in an official dissent.

csjj53c,,"Scalia's dissent will go down as one of the great ones in history. It's masterful:>The substance of today's decree is not of immense personal importance to me. The law can recognize as marriage whatever sexual attachments and living arrangements it wishes, and can accord them favorable civil consequences, from tax treatment to rights of inheritance.Those civil consequences—and the public approval that conferring the name of marriage evidences—can perhaps have adverse social effects, but no more adverse than the effects of many other controversial laws. So it is not of special importance to me what the law says about marriage. It is of overwhelming importance, however, who it is that rules me. Today's decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court. The opinion in these cases is the furthest extension in fact— and the furthest extension one can even imagine—of the Court's claimed power to create “liberties” that the Constitution and its Amendments neglect to mention. This practice of constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine, always accompanied (as it is today) by extravagant praise of liberty, robs the People of the most important liberty they asserted in the Declaration ofIndependence and won in the Revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves."
csjs3ts,bcdm,"> Today's decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court.Tell me, would he say the same thing if he was in the majority rather than the minority? Would he abdicate his decision because he didn't want to be ""the Ruler of 320 million Americans""?"
csjsmks,,"You're misunderstanding his position. It's not that the Supreme Court decided a controversy. It's that the Supreme Court did so by INVALIDATING THE LAWS of States, passed either by the people directly (democracy), or their representatives (republican form of government), and they did so by IMAGINING a right which no one can plausibly argue was enacted into law by the 14th Amendment. They wanted a result, so they got it. That's it. Judicial rule by 5 people over millions.It's understandable that different sides would have different jurisprudence on different topics (like what the Militia in the 2nd Amendment means, or what constitutes a ""search"" in the 4th), but it's hard to imagine that someone can, in good faith, argue that when they passed the 14th, it made States ability to define marriage by gender FEDERALLY ILLEGAL. It did not, however, make their ability to define marriage by age, consanguinity, number of participants, etc. It also did not interfere with any of their other traditional roles in family law, such as adoption."
csjz19k,bcdm,"I don't think I am misunderstanding his position. I just think it's wrong.*Loving v. Virginia* invalidated the laws of states by recognizing that the 14th Amendment applied to marriages of mixed-race couples. Do you therefore suggest that that decision should be overturned, and it should still be up to states to decide whether interracial couples should marry? Why should states not be allowed to define marriage by race, but be allowed to define marriage by gender?"
csjzscc,,"Because 14th Amendment. 1868 ring a bell? Radical Republicans? Some recent war won? Anything that might indicate the *meaning* of the Amendment was very concerned about race? The amendment was aimed SQUARELY at preemptively stopping Jim Crow/Plessy/etc., and very arguably at incorporating the bill of rights. Why should states not be allowed to define marriage by gender, but they can on age/consanguinity/number of participants, etc.? If the 14th Amendment is broad enough to include gender in marriage, it's broad enough to include ANYTHING WE THINK IS A GOOD IDEA. That's not rule by Constitutional representation, it's rule by judicial fiat."
csk10op,bcdm,"""Any person."" Argue that it was all about race when ratified, fine. But that doesn't change the fact that the Equal Protection clause has previously also been used in court precedent for gender and sexual orientation. Legal precedent is there, whether you personally agree or not.Age is not a 14th Amendment issue - minors can not enter into binding contracts. Consanguinity is debatable, but the risk of inbreeding should restrict government acceptance. Number of participants I really don't have a problem with, except for the legal complications that would arise, which could most likely be dealt with.You can call it judicial fiat, but the precedent is there and it is now the law of the land. And neither of us shall change the other's mind, so I shall call it done here."

csjg3u8,i_hate_yams,"> Certainly isn't unheard for judges to make decisions based on what policy should be in place, not based on what is already in the lawThis is very unheard of for the US Supreme Court. Their job is to rule based on what the constitution says not what is going be fair and nice."
csjgsbz,CuriosityKat9,"But they have before. Roe vs. Wade is an excellent example I'm sure most people wouldn't dispute. I've read very similar arguments for why the Supreme Court actually had no power or jurisdiction to decide on Roe vs. Wade, but they did. And that was also based on things the constitution did not say. So it has happened before. The Supreme Court already decides major things without the constitution being their only or primary reference point."
csjja9b,,"Roe v Wade was a heavily criticised judgment IIRC (not on the policy or its stance on abortion, but on the legality of the decision and its reasoning). the wiki page has some explanation on the matter. an excerpt from the wiki page says ""Justice John Paul Stevens, while agreeing with the decision, has suggested that it should have been more narrowly focused on the issue of privacy. According to Stevens, if the decision had avoided the trimester framework and simply stated that the right to privacy included a right to choose abortion, ""it might have been much more acceptable"" from a legal standpoint.[60] His colleague Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had, before joining the Court, criticized the decision for terminating a nascent movement to liberalize abortion law through legislation.[61] Ginsburg has also faulted the approach taken by the Court in the decision for being ""about a doctor's freedom to practice his profession as he thinks best.... It wasn't woman-centered. It was physician-centered.”[62] Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox wrote: ""[Roe's] failure to confront the issue in principled terms leaves the opinion to read like a set of hospital rules and regulations.... Neither historian, nor layman, nor lawyer will be persuaded that all the prescriptions of Justice Blackmun are part of the Constitution.""[63]In a highly cited 1973 article in the Yale Law Journal,[64] Professor John Hart Ely criticized Roe as a decision which ""is not constitutional law and gives almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.""[65] Ely added: ""What is frightening about Roe is that this super-protected right is not inferable from the language of the Constitution, the framers' thinking respecting the specific problem in issue, any general value derivable from the provisions they included, or the nation's governmental structure."" Professor Laurence Tribe had similar thoughts: ""One of the most curious things about Roe is that, behind its own verbal smokescreen, the substantive judgment on which it rests is nowhere to be found.""[66] Liberal law professors Alan Dershowitz,[67] Cass Sunstein,[68] and Kermit Roosevelt[69] have also expressed disappointment with Roe.Jeffrey Rosen[70] and Michael Kinsley[71] echo Ginsburg, arguing that a legislative approach movement would have been the correct way to build a more durable consensus in support of abortion rights. William Saletan wrote that ""Blackmun's [Supreme Court] papers vindicate every indictment of Roe: invention, overreach, arbitrariness, textual indifference.""[72] Benjamin Wittes has written that Roe ""disenfranchised millions of conservatives on an issue about which they care deeply"".[73] And Edward Lazarus, a former Blackmun clerk who ""loved Roe's author like a grandfather"" wrote: ""As a matter of constitutional interpretation and judicial method, Roe borders on the indefensible....Justice Blackmun's opinion provides essentially no reasoning in support of its holding. And in the almost 30 years since Roe's announcement, no one has produced a convincing defense of Roe on its own terms.""[74]"""

However, if originalism and his desired outcome do not sync up, he will insist that he is adhering to his originalist viewpoint even when it's clear that he is not, or that he is taking an extremely tortured view of the English language to get there.

csjhk9n,SD99FRC,"This is because most people don't understand the purpose of the courts. This was always going to be the dissent, and it wouldn't surprise anyone who knew much about the courts and the justices. Both Roberts and Scalia have been against the idea of the Court acting as a legislative body for pretty much the entirety of their careers. I mean, *personally*, I am happy that gays get to marry. I have many gay friends, and my cousin and his husband have been together for something like 15 years or more, and their son is one of the most well behaved and well adjusted kids I know. So at a personal level, I can't be anything other than be overjoyed at the result. I've been smiling all morning.But I also fully understand the dissent, and the dangerous line that is crossed any time the Supreme Court acts as a legislative body above the power of the people. *This time* it's something that is ultimately positive. But who is to say that that's always the case? Especially since Judicial Review isn't even a power given to the SC by the Constitution. Despite the fact that people like to heavily politicize the actions of the Court, nothing in the dissents is about whether or not the decision to allow gay marriage was right or wrong, it's that it wasn't their place to be making that decision in the first place, because that power belonged in the hands of the States."
csjfh0y,FoxyBrownMcCloud,Roberts isn't really an asshole. Now Scalia and Thomas? Good Lord...
csjfs0q,tarants,"Scalia called it an attack on democracy, so if you're looking for more adversarial rhetoric his dissent's got it."
csjfw0u,mywifehasapeen,"It really isn't, though. His argument is demonstrably false. I'm not sure where American conservatives get the idea that Christians invented marriage. I really do think that it comes down to simple ignorance. It's too easy for them to forget (or ignore) that there are hundreds of other countries with thousands of other cultures and a each one has its own take on how to define marriage, sex, and the family unit."
csjfz4q,DaemonSicarius,"I see his point, but is it not the job of SCOTUS when the states aren't acting in the best interest of every citizens rights and in line with the spirit of equal rights? Is he suggesting we should have let the states decide to respect the equal rights of people regardless of sexual orientation when they were ready to? That's what it sounds like to me, and it feels like a foolish way to think. These rights should be immediate. I'm not good on the details in history but wasn't that part of the problem with equal rights for colored people? Many of the states needed to be told instead of given the chance to do it themselves didn't they?"
csjpp72,23977-203804,"Exactly correct; his *language* in dissent was pretty sober and low on the hysteria, sure. But a Justice of the Supreme Court claiming that he's dissenting because he doesn't think it's the Supreme Court's job to *interpret the Constitution* on a previously-unheard nuance of equal rights for a significant group of citizens? This dissent isn't level-headed at all. It tacitly invalidates the reason the Supreme Court exists. If that reasoning holds true, then we can and should solve all Constitutional law questions, *especially* those concerning the rights and dignity of regular people by popular vote. That takes the Constitution's ""created equal"" intent and says, ""naw, we reject that. There aren't really any fundamental rights that the Constitution can protect via the court system. If the majority wants to play keep-away with civil rights that's OK, they should be allowed to do it."" That's about as nuts as it gets. If he'd said ""marriage isn't actually a very fundamental right anymore, so this isn't a Constitutional question,"" that would have gone against common legal wisdom and previous (non-legally-binding, IIRC, IANAL) court precedent like Loving v. Virginia. BUT at least it wouldn't have been a hands-off statement about how the SCOTUS doesn't have a duty to interpret the Constitution on fundamental rights. Did he forget his vocation? Is he being disingenuous and just trying to find a wise-sounding reason to favor entrenched religious prejudice over Constitutional rights? Or does he *really* believe that the SCOTUS should absolve itself of a big part of its function in general? Or just in regards to this one question?"
csjfzg5,dtlv5813,Replace same sex with interracial and see how level headed his argument sounds.
csjg1zv,,"He makes an effort to make it sound like his dissent is about state's rights, but you can still see the moral judgement underneath when he talks about the historic definition of marriage. I'm a bit disturbed by that honestly. His point on state's rights stand on its own legal merits. He didn't need to shoehorn anything else."
csjg6i2,jrakosi,Robert's is a pretty reasonable guy most of the time. I would describe him as a more business oriented conservative. The interesting thing is that this decision will most likely be what a large part of what his tenure as chief justice is remembered for.
csjg8cs,badlungsmckgee,"Indeed, the Roberts dissent is well written. Though I'd point out that the majority opinion addresses this fundamental point, which is that when it comes to civil rights, no one should have to wait for the legislative process. The immediacy of law where civil rights are concerned is in fact part of the reason we have courts. So, yes, this ruling squashes the democratic process, but rightfully so, as civil rights are concerned here."
csjgddb,erhwuifhrueihiu,Not really. Why is it a only a state's decision to define marriage and why is it irrational for federal laws to apply? I smell typical ignorance and fear that is the Right's soul.
csjgk5x,Poops_McYolo,"Because Roberts isn't dissenting based upon his personal belief that gay marriage is or isn't moral, he is basing his opposition on what is legal based upon the constitution. He is claiming that a State should ultimately have the power to change the definition of marriage (gays included if they want, he doesn't care), and that the Supreme Court should not be able to overstep each and every State's definition. I hope that many don't take his dissent as meaning ""Oh this guy hates gay people"", when it is only trying to uphold the power of the people to vote in their state to allow/disallow gay marriage."
csjglea,,"Many of the SCOTUS' opinions and dissents are reasonable. While Scalia and Thomas sometimes make people think otherwise, the people that sit on the bench are an intelligent and qualified bunch. Often times the argument between them boils down to: does the Court have constitutional authority to make the decision, and should they make the decision. That is exactly what is happening here in Roberts dissent, although I agree with the majority on this one."

csjitia,TheMisterFlux,"It's not level headed. It's well written. His logic of changing the definition of marriage when it has stayed the same throughout every period of history totally leaves out arguably the most important time period of humanity: **this one.**As well, his argument that just because the people want it doesn't mean it should become law is fairly ridiculous. That's the idea of democracy. The general population should get what it wants unless there's a damn good reason not to give it to them.And the notion that it's inappropriate for five lawyers to decide to take the power out of the people's hands?

I also no longer have the chance to try and convince people that straight marriage was actually the problem, not disallowing gay marriage. The benefits attached to marriage need to at least be reevaluated and overhauled, if not abolished entirely in favor of a more general civil union. I'm happy for all my gay friends who now get the same benefits I would have were I married, but this was the wrong way to go about it."
csjpnjr,MatttheBruinsfan,"Roberts is Conservative in the sense that he tends to favor strict interpretations of the Constitution, and not assign the power of law to implications from its meanings rather than explicit mentions. He doesn't tend to bend his interpretation to favor keeping all power and privilege in the hands of straight white Republican men in every case the way Scalia does."
csjsdnd,,"The dissent kind of puts me in a weird place personally. I am someone who doesn't believe it is morally to participate in homosexual activities, but at the same time I don't believe the government should have the ability to determine for individuals what it is deemed moral or immoral for personal choices. So I wondered to myself, how could the supreme court *not* legalize gay marriage. What possibly stance could they take to show the constitution says it isn't okay for gays to married to just like those who are heterosexual. Then I saw it was 5-4 and read this dissent. I realize now the question never was should gays be able to get married. The question was, does the constitution allow the supreme court to change state policy. I think I've now changed my mind and agree with Roberts that in matters like this, it should have been decided by the democratic process."
csju5lf,Ratstomper,"It's certainly a point worth noting. I see no reason why gay people shouldn't be allowed to marry, but there is something a little unsettling about 5 people being able to dictate what all the states and the people in them should do.>Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law.Hmm. Easy to forget that's a thing a handful of people can do."
csjx5ik,,Level headed? He literally just said a whole bunch of people should be denied their rights because *tradition*.
csjfd8e,FriendlyFireIsnt,There were four separate dissents. This is the only level headed one.
csji4az,channingman,"If you disagree with the logic of a supreme court justice, or think they aren't level headed, you're probably the one who needs to check himself. Have some respect, these are the highest law in the land and all infinitely more qualified than you."
csjfb1h,lamrin52,Read Scalia's much less level-headed
csjfn4y,poktanju,Scalia's on the record saying that he writes dissents with the aim of entertaining future law students.
csjfuzc,lamrin52,"That's really interesting, I wasn't aware. Also, whoever the next President may be, I think that his argument will come up during their cross-examination"
csjg19c,duffmanhb,President? Cross-examination? What?
csjgvj2,lamrin52,Shit. President's Nomination and questioning in the senate*
csjfjwk,bonecrusher2102,Leave the buffoonery to Scalia.
csjfgbc,flossdaily,"Level-headed?It's total bullshit. Marriage has never been about one man and one woman. ""the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational"" - says Roberts.... except that history is overflowing with examples of plural marriage. The bible itself is full of examples of men with more than one wife.There is nothing level-headed about this argument. Nothing at all. It is an echo of all the arguments that were made against **interracial marriage**.Roberts is a bigot, as are the rest of the dissenters."
csjfx4m,ChagSC,You've cherry-picked through lens of bias and let it blind you to his actual objective stance. To the point where you missed he clearly is fine with it and understands it on a personal level.
csjg5hm,flossdaily,I'm laughing that you think he supports it on a personal level.
csjfmtb,seemedlikeagoodplan,"I'm in Canada, so I don't see a lot of American decisions. But I find a lot of the USSC's dissents, especially on controversial cases, contain a lot of bitching about the majority. They sound like a press release on behalf of the losing side rather than a judicial decision. Am I wrong? Or am I just seeing misleading portions of the dissents?"
csjfnw0,xandar,"I suppose it's level-headed, but it's certainly not free off bullshit.> the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human historyMarriage has meant a lot of different things in different cultures. There is no one definition, and a lot of those were very far from a union between two equals. This ""historic definition"" stuff is nonsense, and either he knows that or has a very tenuous grasp on human history."
csjgsxe,dinosaurs_quietly,"He was writing a dissent, not a law. He easily could have filled in clarifications to avoid your argument, but it would be a waste of time and bad writing. Recent western history doesn't have a lot of gay marriage."
csjhz92,xandar,He's claiming there's a single clear historic definition of marriage. There isn't. And if there was it wouldn't match closely with how we view marriages (straight or gay) today.
csjfspi,Azthioth,"He has summarized the problem with this blitzkrieg of homosexual agenda perfectly. If you want to marry, fine. If you want the same laws, fine. Fight for what you believe in, but if you want acceptance. This is not how it is won.Win the people, win your freedom to marry. Force people to accept it and you have set your cause back by quite a bit. Just because reddit likes gay marriage does not mean the majority in the US does.This will hurt, not help acceptance."
csjg5oi,dotsbourne,"I cannot possibly articulate how little the ""this is not how acceptance is won"" thing is true in history. If the court had not declared segregation illegal, it would have perpetuated much, much longer than it did (hell, it's still subtly in place in a lot of places). If you wait for ""the public"" to agree on an issue you will be waiting a long, long goddamn time, and Stonewall was in the 60s."
csjgaee,Azthioth,"This a great response and all, but something that baffles me throughout all this is that most people who cheer for the government to force things on state law and a public that may not be ready for it, is that they have no concept of what letting a government do this can mean.Cheer now till they force something on you that you don't like. Roberts is right. We work on this slowly and patiently and it will be much better. This decision is based off of emotions and agenda, not law."
csjgfl0,dotsbourne,"I disagree. The majority opinion is correct: Waiting for ""the public"" to approve of your rights is still systematically denying you of them, and you should not have to keep your mouth shut and just wait for societal views to come around on whether you deserve to be treated like a human. It's true for racial issues; it's true for gay rights; it's true for trans rights; it's true for equal protections of all stripes and colors. I have lived in many places in the US which would not have legalized gay marriage for another ten years *minimum.* That's ten more years of people being denied tax benefits, being denied access to their ill loved ones, being denied the right to have children, being stripped of their belongings after their partner dies, all because ""well, people don't think you deserve it yet, but wait and they'll come around eventually."" ""Slow and patient"" is easy enough to argue for when you aren't the one suffering."
csjgpc8,Azthioth,"Who said anything about keeping their mouths shut? You act as if society is physically moving against the gay community when that is far from the truth. If anything, it is actually growing more sympathetic. This is not the same world as the civil rights movements. While I agree that they have face persecution, I will never agree it was on the same level as the blacks in America.""Suffering"" is a very dramatic way to say it. No one is being beaten to death and no one is being told they cannot be together, nor are they being told not to fight for what they believe in. Our country is a country of law, not emotions. If you want it to be run by emotions, then good luck cause a whole bunch of things you don't like might be headed your way.They will win, eventually, but until then, it is just that, a fight and patience. Doing this is great for them, but they simply passed a law for 2-5% of America that will have massive ramification for the future, but let's not worry about that shall we? Let's kick it down the road.Just because we want something, doesn't mean we have to get by any means necessary. I will always defend people's rights to fight for what they want, but this decision isn't law. That's the end of it. The Supreme Court is their to uphold the law. This was far from it, and it is wrong."
csjgv4x,dotsbourne,">No one is being beaten to death and no one is being told they cannot be together, nor are they being told not to fight for what they believe in.No one? That's a dramatic and generalized statement that's definitely not true. Again, there are many states where this sort of thing is still worryingly common.Gay marriage is acceptable to a lot more than 2-5% of Americans -- the current statistics show that somewhere around 40% of Americans approve of it, but due to the structure of the States and the judicial systems -- as well as laws passed *years* ago, before the opinion was anywhere near as good toward it -- the laws still made sure that gay people could not be married. (And, by the way, the current estimate is that *10%* of people are gay, and that isn't counting individuals who are bi or pansexual that might be in same-sex relationships, or individuals who are closeted.)The Supreme Court has always been there for oversight. Their role is to rule on whether laws are constitutional. Them deciding that banning a group of individuals from getting married is perfectly in line with their job. If they were only in office to ""uphold"" the law, there would be no Brown v Board of Education."
csjh8uz,scarleteagle,"I'm not weighing in either way but to prevent the spread of misinformation, that 10 percent thing has been debunked a while ago, the number of non straight is closer to [3.4 percent.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/07/15/what-percentage-of-the-u-s-population-is-gay-lesbian-or-bisexual/)"
csjhcgv,Azthioth,"Anecdotal evidence is anecdotal. No one is is being beaten to death and I have seen little to no evidence of any mass gathering to declare the rights of Americans not to fight for what they believe in. Please do not confuse that to mean that those who are fighting against them ask them not to fight. That is how a fight works.Also, the approval rating is much higher than that, http://www.pewforum.org/2015/06/08/graphics-slideshow-changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/It shows 57% in approval. Please listen to reason when I say, this is a battle that can easily be won in our life time. This is not the civil rights era. We do not need to force this on people. It will happen shortly. There are currently 37 states who have legalized it. How does that make this a slow process? Social pressure and the slow creep of acceptance will win this in a far better fashion, but I guess we are past that now. We have to have it and I can guarantee this will only make it worse.Also, unless you have a better source, the only one I can find that is from 2015 is this, and it says 4%.

csjf4f5,cahutchins,"Roberts' dissent is rational, and the argument that letting public opinion and state legislatures gradually accept the inevitable path of history could be more effective in swaying on-the-fence holdouts makes sense as far as it goes.But he doesn't make a compelling argument for why the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment would apply to all areas of the law save one. And the very same argument was made by ""reasonable"" opponents of the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s, who said pretty much exactly the same thing — ""Yeah, we believe in equality, but we don't want to upset the people who don't.""Roberts is articulate, calm, and compassionate. But he's also wrong."
csjggez,its_good,"Exactly, if you read the opinion and substitute ""same-sex marriage"" for ""interracial marriage"" I don't think as many people would consider it as reasonable as a lot of people is giving him credit for."
csjkiha,Flyingbuffaloman,"Except you couldn't do that. His argument is that the current definition of marriage is defined as man and woman, and there is no legal obligation for that to change. I don't think marriage has ever been commonly defined as being between man and woman of the same race."
csjl1s6,wiibiiz,"As recently as 1967, interracial marriage was illegal in some states and seen as an aberration (mostly due to social darwinist ideas about race and the southern white fears of ""cross-contamination"" of the white stock). In that time, interracial marriage was still highly unusual, and in the past it was even more so. The same arguments were used then as are used today. You can find speeches about how these laws were not restricting people in interracial relationship's right to marry, as they could still marry within their race (which was how ""traditional"" marriage was seen at the time). As a student of history, the definition of marriage is complex and has consistently changed over time, and the law has always been an avenue through which that change has been implemented."
csjlde7,Flyingbuffaloman,"I personally support gay marriage but I think that ""Interracial marriage is bad and should be illegal"" and "" Marriage is when two people of the same race are married"" are different ideas."
csjmdxo,ericanderton,"This is the very point where both sides to this argument butt heads, plus all the stuff that's at stake over this. Consider the core assertion being argued: ""homosexual"" is something a person *is* and always has been, and not something they choose to be.If you believe that, then the issue is ultimately no different than race. If you don't, then the comparison appears ridiculous and unnecessary. Extend that to the ability to legally marry, and the parallels are abundant."
csjl747,Jfreak7,Show me a legalized definition that says anything about race. Who cares if people try to use that as an excuse. We're talking about the legal definition.
csjmhs2,wiibiiz,"How's the Racial Integrity Act of 1924, a Virginia law that established strict definitions for ""whites"" and ""coloreds"", mandated that all children born in the state and all new residents entering the state would be separated into these two categories under the eyes of the law, and forbade marriages between these two groups as part of an effort to implement what the legislature called ""scientific eugenics"" into the marriage law of Virginia? BTW, that law was one of MANY racist laws on the topic of marriage that were excused under the pretense of ""state's rights"", and it only expired in 1967 when Richard and Mildred Loving brought suit against it to the Supreme Court. Sound familiar?"
csk4nm0,maintain_composure,"The question isn't whether or not there's a legal obligation to change it, the question is whether or not there's a legitimate government interest in maintaining the status quo. Which there isn't."

csjodjr,president2016,">if you read the opinion and substitute ""same-sex marriage"" for ""interracial marriage"" I don't think as many people would consider it as reasonableI don't believe marriage is a fundamental right nor do I believe the government should have any input into it. Social contracts, relational benefits, legal standing, sure. But they've just opened Pandoras box in the legal sense. It would have been much easier over the long term to simply remove marriage from governmental oversight esp as future cases involving religious standing/freedoms, exceptions, polygamy, etc make their way to the court. That and you would have much less resistance from the religious people. It would make it much easier to work with if you removed the religious side of it."
csjqcqf,witchwind,Like SCOTUS did in Loving v. Virginia?
csjq2gv,its_good,"You would have the same resistance, because they would claim the count was taking away their marriage. There are 2 concepts with the same name. A religious institution and the legal concept. The one doesn't affect the other. Giving a group of people legal marriage doesn't affect anyone's religion. My point was that the same arguments used against interracial marriage 60 years ago are being used against same sex marriage now, and in not too many years people will look back and wonder wtf the problem was."
csjn7ir,Moinllieon,"~~I think Robert's point is that it didn't take a Supreme Court decision to legalize interracial marriages, it shouldn't take one to legalize same sex marriages.~~Edit: Did not know there actually was a decision regarding interracial marriages.

csjo6ec,its_good,"What are you talking about? It WAS a supreme court decision that legalized them. Look up Loving v. VirginiaTechnically, it just made the laws preventing it illegal, but that essentially what the decision today did."

csjjldg,,interracial marriage would not make sense in his sentence. There are tons of interracial marriages throughout history.
csjorvv,goldman105,Historically I could also buy my wife and force her to marry me and that was the status quo for all but the last hundred years. And we all agree that that is wrong. So this whole historical point is bullshit culturally I could have ten wives but we dont allow that either.
csjr27e,,"No, what you are describing is some kind of local tradition, not something that was universally true of various cultures."
csjso5f,goldman105,Women haven't had rights in like 90% of countries for ever only now do we see them with any rights. And your telling me that wasn't the custom in traditional marriage in Europe and Asia. The current idea of marriage by love is a new thing not the root of marriage. Indians today still practice arranged marriages
csjuk2g,,purchasing a wife is what you said. I did not claim that women have historically had the choice of who they marry. I said that women being purchased was not a universal historical reality.
csjzg7x,,"There is no such thing as a ""universal norm."" There is an exception to almost every rule, including extremes like cannibalism and pedophilia."
csjkiq1,AadeeMoien,"Historically they had a lot of the same arguments. That the races had ""always been"" separate and so forth."
csjfvei,,Yup. You can't say that the *Loving v. Virginia* ruling was the right one but that this is the wrong one. It's the same idea. Unless he's saying that ruling was also no bueno.
csjilm6,bac5665,"Roberts and Scalia would tell you that the traditional definitions of marriage don't object to interracial marriage, but they do object to gay marriage. Ancient societies would have recognized marriage between Persians and Greeks, but would have derided them as unnatural. They wouldn't have understood that marriage between two men is even a marriage at all. That is a cognizable difference, if one that shouldn't matter."
csjk5lv,,"Race and racism don't apply to your Persians and Greeks example, since race was constructed much much later."

csk195k,FUCK_YOUR_PUFFIN,"not attacking you/anyone, but we should all take a second to realize how fucked up and pathetic it is that this comment thread is what we have to do in order to give gay people the right to marry. in order to treat our fellow americans equally, we have to examine and debate persian and greek history and read herodotus."
csjlctv,wmeather,"> Roberts and Scalia would tell you that the traditional definitions of marriage don't object to interracial marriage,So they'd lie? Loving v Virginia came about because of state laws protecting traditional monoracial marriage. This wasn't a new concept the states were trying to push, but a response to a perceived attack on a long-established tradition."
csjljd9,bac5665,"They quoted dictionaries from the 1700s that say one man and one woman, but don't mention race. Few attacked an interratial marriage by denying that it's a marriage at all, but they make that claim all the time against SSM."
csjnhay,wmeather,">Few attacked an interratial marriage by denying that it's a marriage at all.A majority of the country did just that, actually. Anti-miscegenation laws were a real thing (and the attempted constitutional amendments in 1871, 1912–1913 and 1928), hence Loving v Virginia."
csji6cy,TracyMorganFreeman,Yes you can technically. Loving v. Virginia addressed the criminalization of interracial marriages. This addressed the lack of legal acknowledgement of gay marriages.
csjiy54,ZeiglerJaguar,"Name one way, in the eyes of the Constitution, that those two things are different."

csjo8vo,palfas,"Incorrect, this addressed the banning of gay marriage, which is essentially criminalizing it"
csjpbes,TracyMorganFreeman,No it is not. If a homosexual couple got married they wouldn't be put in jail. Their marriage just wouldn't be recognized in the legal sense.
csji7sm,MadPoetModGod,"I mean, he's not *saying* it. But...."
csjjqga,,"You're forgetting something key here. Race was PRECISELY the issue at point in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. The 14th was passed in 1868. Gender, Polygamy, or any number of other issues were not, and they were EXPRESSLY NOT (remember, the radical republicans that passed the amendments were as anti-polygamy as they were anti-slavery.) Many people of the day believed after passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments that discrimination based on race is exactly what they prohibited. It's reasonable, and actually compelling, to say that's what the laws *MEANT*. There is no such legitimate argument with same-sex (or polygamous) marriage. One can be all for enshrining protection of same-sex marriage in the Constitution, but it should be the 28th Amendment, or it remains up to the states. 5 people pretending the 14th says something it simply does not is unfortunately tyranny. You may agree with it today, but tomorrow you may not. As long as you care about the other amendments meaning what they say (the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th matter to a lot of people), we should respect the 14th."
csjk6fy,,Why are you talking about polygamy? That's like... an entirely different issue.
csjkgnn,,"If the 14th Amendment changed something other than race, there's no way to argue it ONLY affects gender, and not age, number of participants, consanguinity, or other ""regulations"" of consensual marriage.But the majority today would have us believe the 14th Amendment constitutionally protects same-sex marriage. You can't do that without just admitting words, OR INTENT, don't matter. It's pure policy making, right or wrong.You can't be pro- Constitutional Democracy and pro- today's decision on a procedural level. It's one or the other."
csjl5pk,Svennig,"Bear in mind I'm not American, so I don't really understand your constitution, but it would seem from the text of section 1 that it has nothing to do with race as written:>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.That seems (as is appropriate) very carefully written - if they wanted it to explicitly mention race then they could have done. Indeed, if we consider the role of the constitution as a document that defines what the government can *not* do then they chose the path that conveys the widest number of restrictions. I would not expect this if the issue was solely about race."
csjln25,wmeather,"The constitution doesn't describe what the government can't do. It describes what it can do. Unlike the right of the people, the government's powers are numerated, albeit vaguely in some cases."
csjlrx1,Svennig,My apologies I should have been more clear - I was referring to the *amendments* to the constitution in that instance.
csjnd2i,wmeather,"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.You didn't really think they forgot about free speech and had to grant it to us in an amendment, did you?

csjmuds,jmalbo35,"Constitutional Amendments are part of the Constitution, and a lot of them definitely specify what government can't do."
csjn3vl,wmeather,"They just say the government can't infringe upon the people's rights. They couldn't do that even if said rights were not enumerated, since the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."
csjoog9,jmalbo35,I don't even understand what you're trying to say. First you claimed that>The constitution doesn't describe what the government can't dothen you say that the Constitution>just say[s] the government can't infringe upon the people's rights.Is that not an explicit contradiction? Because it certainly seems like one to me.
csjpbi6,wmeather,"I'm saying that they're not in any way a restriction on the government's powers. They already couldn't violate our rights. If they could they wouldn't be rights, would they? You have may noticed none of those amendments give us rights, they just say they can't be infringed upon, which was already the case, as it is for every single right which isn't enumerated. Hell, voting wasn't even mentioned as a right until the 14th amendment. Surely you don't think that wasn't a right until it was ratified, especially given that it doesn't grant the right, only prevents it's infringement. It, like every other right mentioned in the constitution, is pre-existing."
csjqf2s,jmalbo35,"Still not getting your point. Specifying which rights can't be infringed upon by the government is literally ""describ[ing] what the government can't do"", which is the opposite of what you said. That's all I was commenting on."
csjr08s,wmeather,"Do you think that the government can infringe upon unenumerated rights? If not, then how would enumerating said right be a restriction of the government's powers in any way?"
csjriv5,jmalbo35,">Do you think that the government can infringe upon unenumerated rights?Yes, because it has at many different points in history. Why do you think the 14th amendment was passed in the first place, for example?"
csjryro,wmeather,"> Yes, because it has at many different points in history. Then by the same logic it can infringe upon enumerated rights, because it has at many different points in history.If that's the case, then how are enumerated rights a restriction on the government's powers?"
csjs4ay,jmalbo35,">If that's the case, then how are enumerated rights a restriction on the government's powers?I'm not getting what you mean? Many amendments are specifically worded as restrictions on what governments can and cannot do. Section 1 of the 14th, for example, states:>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. **No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.**That's explicitly worded as a restriction on powers of state governments, and is in response to states infringing upon rights that weren't explicitly enumerated previously."
csjurtr,wmeather,"> Many amendments are specifically worded as restrictions on what governments can and cannot do. Yep, but they don't restrict what the government can do as proven by the equal legal standing given to both enumerated and enumerated rights reiterated by the 9th amendment.>That's explicitly worded as a restriction on powers of state governments, Yep. It just doesn't actually have that effect. For that to be the case the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, would have to be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.Are you claiming that the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, should be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people?If not, then how can the enumeration of rights restrict government powers, regardless of their wording?"
csjo41t,,"Not a bad question at all. It's not solely about race, but race is clearly one of the rights it was clearly designed to protect, as the drafters and people of the day clearly understood. So you're correct that the 14th Amendment was written rather broad, and there's a long debate about whether it's just procedural rights, or includes substantive rights as well. (For example, there's been a long process called ""incorporation"" whereby the Due Process Clause was held to create a right against the States for rights found in the Bill of Rights, like free speech.) But until VERY RECENTLY, there's never been any suggestion that it includes any right to same-sex marriage. There's no way it even could have. It's not in the bill of rights, or any other established or historical right."
csjqkbi,Svennig,"Hmmm. I'm not sure it *does* include a de-facto right to same-sex marriage. What it seems to define is a scope under which people are equal in the eyes of the law. Now it seems to me that if the institution of marriage conveyed no benefits under the law then we probably wouldn't be in this scenario and the supreme court wouldn't have had to pass judgement on it. But, if it's anything like it is in the UK, marriage conveys quite a lot of legal ramifications: inheritance changes quite significantly, power of attorney when your spouse is sick, pensions are handled differently on death, there are tax benefits etc.I don't see how there is ""equal protection of the laws"" if only *some* of the citizens are entitled to these."
csjr709,,">Now it seems to me that if the institution of marriage conveyed no benefits under the law then we probably wouldn't be in this scenario and the supreme court wouldn't have had to pass judgement on it.Many states enacted Civil Unions with equal benefits. They were still sued, and overturned, by this ruling purely for the social status of ""marriage."" Equal protection is complex, but all laws ultimate favor some groups over others. The real question is who gets to decide the definition of marriage, and historically that has always been the States. Same reason you can have different ages of consent/drinking/consanguinity, etc. Family law issues have always been State issues. There's no 14th Amendment reason to change that. Equal protection doesn't mean each state must have the same definition of marriage anymore than it means they all have to have the same drinking laws."
csjre91,Svennig,"Yeah but let's be honest here, (and I'm assuming you're American), the whole ""separate but equal"" thing of Civil Unions was never going to fly."
csjrp9k,,"No legal reason why not. It's similarity to Plessy is purely rhetorical. 1st - Race and marriage have different legal standing. Always have. It's just intelligent advocacy to link them, but not legally defensible.2nd - One of the reasons (not the only reason), why separate but equal in regards to race didn't fly, is because it's not even possible. You cannot build two identical bathrooms, trains, schools, etc. everywhere. The physical world doesn't allow it. They will by definition be different. Laws do not work that way. Laws are intangible things which absolutely can be separate but equal. We do it all the time in a billion different ways, one off the top would be ""adopted"" vs ""biological."" Separate but equal."
csjtb6c,Svennig,">Race and marriage have different legal standing. Always have. That's just an appeal to tradition. Just because historically they have had different standing does not validate that treatment. Even if we accept that as a premise it would be churlish to deny the similarities when it comes to questions of legal equality. >Laws are intangible things which absolutely can be separate but equal. We do it all the time in a billion different ways, one off the top would be ""adopted"" vs ""biological.""They *can* be separate but equal. But sometimes we have to question: *should* they. Adopted vs biological is a poor choice of argument as that is a genetic distinction that is merely *recognised* by the law, not *created* by it. Marriage for same-sex couples vs Civil Unions for others is a distinction that has been manufactured by society and (as we have seen today) can be overturned just as easily. Consider police. A police officer driving a marked vehicle with the correct training can do some crazy things on the road. They can drive on the wrong side, exceed the speed limit, treat red lights as a give-way, driving in a bus lane etc. There exists a difference in the rights of the police compared to the rights of myself (who cannot do such things). This is not, in and of itself, a discriminatory situation *because I can become a police officer*. There exists no legal barrier in a well-publicised pathway to me obtaining such rights. If only men could do so, we would consider this horrendously discriminatory. If only whites of all genders could do so there would be a possibly-greater outcry. If only heterosexual people could do so it would be just as wrong. And in no sense would this be alleviated by creating a ""men's"" and ""women's"" police force, or a ""blacks"" and ""whites"" police force. We'd view such things as barbaric. And this is perhaps my greatest confusion: why does the small-government argument go out of the window when it comes to the topic of gay sex and marriage? Why is it OK to draft, maintain and enforce two parallel laws at the taxpayer's expense *if they are truly equal*. Why is that even close to defensible, outside of any ethical reasons, from a purely small-government or even a fiscal perspective?"
csjtpym,,">That's just an appeal to tradition.It's an appeal to legal precedent, which is binding in a common law jurisdiction. >They can be separate but equal. But sometimes we have to question: should they. Great point. But the legal decider of the ""should"" is the people or the people's representatives, NOT the court's. The Court rightfully must step in when a State law is unconstitutional. But that just isn't the case here. No one can argue with a straight face that the day after the 14th Amendment was passed, family laws restricting the benefits of marriage to a man and a woman were suddenly unconstitutional. What the court did today was create a ruling they wanted. It's always a danger, and yes, even Scalia does it sometimes, but this is the most blatant case of it in our time. This case will go down with Lochner and Dred Scott as a historical dark point in the court's reasoning.>And this is perhaps my greatest confusion: why does the small-government argument go out of the window when it comes to the topic of gay sex and marriage?

But my point has been primarily to attack today's decision not on the end result, but on the process. The process is, in my opinion, unashamedly de-legitimizing to the Constitution and the court.I'm not an end-justifies the means kind of guy. States have the right to make laws.

csjkv91,,"I feel like this probably isn't worth getting into with you.But marriage is now considered a Constitutional right. Because it comes with certain privileges. No one is withholding those privileges from someone who wants to practice polygamy; they can certainly get married just like anyone else and benefit from those privileges. The reason polygamy does not count is because you can't be ""more married"" when it's considered a right. You are not being denied a right because you have it. It's almost like fighting for the right to have multiple votes. Would that be what some people want? Yeah, definitely. But do they have a right to that? No."
csjnyj8,,">No one is withholding those privileges from someone who wants to practice polygamy; they can certainly get married just like anyone else and benefit from those privilegesI don't think that's a bad argument per se, but keep in mind this same argument was used in this debate about homosexuality (and race too), there's nothing legally preventing a gay person from marrying the opposite gender. It's a marriage of convenience essentially."
csjoenc,,"To keep with the vote analogy, I'd say it's the equivalent of wanting multiple votes for whoever you want when your rights afford you only one compared to getting the option to vote but only for one party that you may not want to actually vote for (forcing gay people to marry the opposite gender if they wanted to exercise their right to marriage)."

csji866,silverfox762,"Then that sentiment should be present in every opinion he writes that's part of any decision. Suggesting that 5 or even 9 Justices finding something Consititutionally valid or invalid is what they do. To suggest that one decision that's 5/4 is somehow a lesser decision because ""5 lawyers"" were a majority in ANY decision is to suggest that the Court shouldn't allow 5/4 decisions, if you want to take it to extremes. That's the purpose of the court. That's why there's an odd number of Justices. Their job is to measure legal issues against the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and that's exactly what they did today. The 14 Amendment offers equal protection to All citizens. The fact that only 5 Justices feel this way is what should be horrifying. That 4 Justices think equal protection shouldn't be extended to certain people is just scary to me."

If they made a very clear abuse of power (which is already difficult since the cases are brought to them, unlike the other branches that can make the first move), they still require a lot of cooperation.

csjkxzb,,> (Or those millions could change the constitution.)Funny you should say that. The petitioners in this case argued the opposite. Since states had constitutional bans against gay marriage it was very difficult for the will of the people to be heard and exercised through normal democratic means.
csjmx9j,silverfox762,"This is what's lost on so many. When states with ballot measure systems pass a constitutional amendment, it takes 2/3 of the legislature to overturn such things, making them damned near impossible to get rid of in most places.

csjod7l,palfas,"Except most of us don't believe the ruling went outside the law, we believe the 14th is quite clear on this matter."
csjtxfk,Salinator,Ok. Well I'll go ahead and trust that Justice Roberts probably has a more compelling legal argument than some random Redditors.
csjv5lu,ThyFemaleDothDeclare,"Well you shouldn't, because I am a lawyer who has read his dissent and he actually gives 0 legal argument. Absolutely none.All he substantiates is that he basically wishes judicial review didn't exist, which really makes you wonder why he took the job.Not to mention he completely contradicted this exact sentiment THE DAY BEFORE.It is clearly eloquent, but he gave no legal basis whatsoever. Even less than Alito, who just cried that people are going to treat Christians like bigots now. Which again, has nothing to do with fundamental rights and the 14th amendment."

The court basically said just because there is an election/primary does not mean you suspend the first amendment on the subjects of politics.

The trouble is exacerbated when those intelligent elites have lifetime appointments and their ability to make decisions is never questioned no matter how old they get or how poor their track record is.

csk1sw8,Olathe,"That's a common misconception. No, it definitely wasn't a power that they granted to themselves in *Marbury v Madison*. Wikipedia has [a nice article on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review_in_the_United_States).Most importantly, if the judicial review in *Marbury v Madison* was used to enact that very power of judicial review, it would be a power that could disappear at any time, since it would be circular: supposedly the very thing that granted them the power had no power whatsoever to grant it in the first place. You'd think that the other branches would have noticed and used this when they had strong disagreements with the courts.What reason might the other branches have for not doing that? The reason is because it's not true. Before *Marbury v Madison*, there was plenty of legislative support and support from the Constitutional Convention delegates for judicial review as well as a wide recognition that the Constitution allowed for judicial review.And it's interesting to look at what they actually decided in *Marbury v Madison*, namely that Congress had attempted to give the Supreme Court jurisdiction over things that the Constitution didn't give it jurisdiction over, and so the clause that gave the Supreme Court that jurisdiction was void.When paired with the common misconception, it gives the impression that they disregarded the limits of the Constitution in order to uphold the limits of the Constitution, which is very unlikely, to say the least.It should be noted also that the Supreme Court had already decided the constitutionality of some Federal laws. For example, nine years before *Marbury v Madison*, they did it in *United States v. Yale Todd*."
csjkf4y,ecib,"Whoaaah, hold up. Who let you out of r/harley? Anyway, that line jumped out at me too. I view it as pure condescension. Nobody knows better than him the role of the Judiciary in interpreting Legislative-born law signed by the Executive, as well as the Constitution itself. As you said, the Supreme Court did exactly what they exist and have the power to do: *interpret* the law. Roberts didn't get his way, and so wouldn't even refer to his fellows on the bench as judges as that would remind everybody of their role and legitimacy. He's trying to semantically (and childishly) attack their legitimacy itself. You're absolutely right that conservative media will seize on this. They'll ignore that the position of the Supreme Court is that equal marriage rights are Constitutionally protected and pretend that a dissenting *opinion* indicates the exact opposite. Watching Roberts play dumb on the role of his own court in a written dissent is pretty hilarious though. Made me grin."

Once you've done that, it's curtains to Roe v. Wade.Don't tempt them."

Would those who do not believe that same sex couples should have the right to marry then rejoice and say justice and christian values have been upheld? Honestly, people have to remember, same sex couples are not taking away the rights of christians, they are extending them to other members of our society. They do not want to tear the fabric of christian society, or of any one else. They just want to be with their loved ones and not be discriminated against. And have that which modern society has taught people is important, marry the one you love."

However, given enough time, a room full of sharp lawyers could probably use the Constitution to argue that up is actually down.Having said all that, this doesn't seem at all different from using Constitutional principles to end discriminatory laws in the 1960s. The Roberts' ""let's wait and see"" approach sounds all well and good, except that there are actual people living right now who don't deserve having to wait until state legislatures get their heads out of their asses to acknowledge what is pretty clearly a Constitutional right.

And, this week Texas agreed to allow same sex divorces, which means they were recognizing marriages from other states.At this point, the Texas Supreme Court looks like they were going to do this before too much longer anyway, they were just hoping the legislature would get in gear and pass it.Btw, one funny thing to me about Texas is that often an election in a rural county will be between Republican and Libertarian, with no one running as Democrat at all..."

csjfwh8,rocketvat,"Agreed, and ""a State's decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational"" is a particularly bullshit line of reasoning."
csjgnrx,sgdfgdfgcvbn,"Not really. In a matter like this there isn't some kind of definitive truth to find by better measurements or some advance is mathematics. There is no way to find incontrovertible evidence that requires one to shift their opinion or be irrational.I don't think it's ethical to maintain the historical distinction, but it's not an objective matter either. It's hard to argue that maintaining the status quo in this case is somehow inherently irrational."
csjgxd7,WRONGFUL_BONER,I'm pretty sure he specifically means that the:>persisted in every culture throughout human historyline is an exremely trite and overused line and pretty untrue in its sweeping generalization about the *entirety of humanity through ten thousand years of history*

csjhf0a,tidderwork,"> but it's not an objective matter either. It's hard to argue that maintaining the status quo in this case is somehow inherently irrational.I typically don't jump in on threads like this, but today I feel compelled. The religious institution of marriage isn't an objective matter, but the government institution of marriage is. The rights and privileges granted to married couples are significant in our society. The biggest ones I can think of are the legal rights for medical care/decisions, child custody, taxation, and spousal privilege in court. If churches and religions want to discriminate, that's fine, and a constitutionally-protected right. States should not have that freedom to discriminate. Polygamists are next in the marriage equality debate, I think."
csjiiix,sgdfgdfgcvbn,"No, even at the state level it's not an objective matter.By objective I mean strictly factual, in the scientific sense. You cannot produce some kind of measurement or equation that demonstrates same-sex couples need to be allowed to marry.I agree with you that I find it ""clear"" that marriage shouldn't be restricted to only a male and a female. But I can't back that up with anything beyond vague arguments of equality, fairness, etc. I can't prove, beyond a doubt, that same sex couples need to be married.And that's fine. There are many, many important issues that don't boil down to something so nice and simple."
csjjqc7,rocketvat,"As soon as you recognize that these legal protections are being denied to individual human beings on the basis of sexual orientation, that's it, pack your bag-- we're done here. It's discrimination pure and simple and you don't need to invoke lengthy philosophical debate about the nature of marriage. It's a legal issue and it is objective in every way that matters."
csjkggp,sgdfgdfgcvbn,"No, that's not true.The government can absolutely discriminate. It's a big part of what it does, actually. If you want to say it can't discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation then you have some work to do.It's not a given that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is wrong. At least, not in the same sense that the Earth is goes around the Sun. It's clear to some people - like you and me - but it doesn't fall into the realm of scientific fact.Legally, the issue becomes even more muddled. Now you have to work within the existing framework and your proposition actually becomes even more strict than this ruling. This ruling just legalizes same sex marriages."
csjh16r,OutOfStamina,"Well, I'm not sure /u/rocketvat is making this point exactly, but to me the bullshit in that sentence is ""that has persisted in every culture through human history""Marriage in the bible:http://images.elephantjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/marriage.jpgWhich I only bring up because it's usually religiously motivated to not allow gay marriage - and the religious just don't site their source accurately when they say ""one man one woman"" when they are using a book that also condones slavery and breaks down the rules about marrying slaves.The moment the government took over marriage from the church (who took it from secular ideas to begin with...) it had to stop looking at it from a religious point of view, lest it favor one over the others - which it is expressly forbade from doing.Also, ""avocado"" (I have a bunch of posts about avocados in the past few days, it feels weird to not be writing that word in a post)."
csjk3xo,sgdfgdfgcvbn,"Yeah, that's a fair criticism. He probably should have hedged his phrasing a bit.The intention, however, I think is valid.

Most of human history didn't include bathing properly. Most of human history didn't have a constitution that sought to grant rights to minorities and majorities alike. A large percentage of the planet (by land mass) - *today* - doesn't have representative governments. Most of human history is littered with kings as government. Most of history has included slavery which is of course the go-to example of unequal rights for a group of people. I'm not sure history is where to look for guidance on what rights people should have.At any rate, this is the US.

csjhbem,,"Well, I would say that if he truly feels that the equal protection clause doesn't apply in this matter, then there's no need to also make the argument, ""that's how it's always been done"".But mainly, I think that argument is bullshit because he claims that the definition of marriage as being between one man and one woman has persisted throughout every culture in human history. It hasn't. Marriage has been defined in many ways throughout human history."
csjisx7,sgdfgdfgcvbn,"His wording was a little absolute, and should have been relaxed. His point stands though. In our own relevant history (meaning the things that have more or less shaped our current society), marriage has been pretty strictly a man and a women. Even as you expand the times and cultures you consider, one thing you don't lose is that it involves a man and a woman.As for needing to make the argument... no. He didn't. He also didn't need to argue for the social benefits of not binding the states with their decision. It's reasonable to include though."
csjk3sv,ligtweight,"Except the argument that marriage has always been between a man and woman in every culture throughout the history of humanity is factually wrong. Prior to Christianity you had the Greeks, Romans, Egyptians and certain Chinese who all practiced same sex unions if not actually marriages. On this specific continent there were tribes of Native Americans that did the same. From what I can see the only culture where marriage has been strictly a 1-man, 1-woman has been Christianity. Our current society has definitely been shaped by more than just the Christian Church."
csjkt4n,sgdfgdfgcvbn,"Except Christianity was the prevailing influence for most of the cultures that most directly lead to us. If this wasn't the case, we wouldn't still be dealing with cruft like this today.Furthermore, I never said anything about strictly two-person unions, nor strictly opposite sex unions. I said they all involve a man and a woman. It would be quite unusual to find otherwise, considering the whole reproduction side of things.And even if you want to argue everything else under the sun, at the very least you can say for the history of this nation - which is frankly the most relevant in this kind of argument - things have been defined as strictly two people of opposite sex. It's weaker than the unfortunate wording used in the Dissent, but not that much practically speaking."

csjp3dl,iyja,"If it were logistically feasible, every legal case would be decided by popular vote. It would completely bypass the need for judges.The idea that judges are able to do so is because their authority is derived from the president and vetted by the congress. Both of whose authority are derived from the popular vote of the people. So how it works is like this:People ---> President/Congress(draft laws) ---> Judge ---> Interpretation of LawThe problem with this arrangement is that people can claim and sometimes they are right to; that the judge has not acted for the majority of the people. Whereas compared to:People ---> President/Congress(draft laws) ---> People ---> Interpretation the lawNow no one can claim that the majority is not represented. This is what Roberts' concern is about, that every single SCOTUS case will *always* have people grumbling that it is *not* representative of the people of which they are right. Such hot button issues are best solved by referendums."
csjfszl,thebigditch,"Great comment, you really captured how I feel after reading that portion of the dissent by Roberts."
csjhh29,AsskickMcGee,"Yeah, Roberts reminds me a bit of John McCain. I think he's wrong about a lot of things, but also rational, well-spoken, and genuine. His appeal that states should catch up one by one, and that anything less is ""sidestepping democracy"" is historically flawed. The federal government has rammed decisions down state's throats since its inception. Hell, that's pretty much SCOTUS's main job! The constitutionality of bans was on trial here, and the majority's opinion focuses on that. By insisting on States making individual decisions, Roberts is the one sidestepping his actual job. Why would he do this? Probably because, from the sound of it, he knows homosexuals are fine and doesn't buy into any of the conservatives' arguments about the negative consequences of their marriage or child rearing. He even sorta hints that he wants the states to all eventually agree on it. He can't make a case for why same-sex couples are any different than opposite-sex ones other than ""history"", so if he concentrated on why the Constitution should treat them differently he'll come up short."
csjggqj,lithedreamer,"I think he's wrong, but I do think the reasoning is sound. Roe vs Wade was so complete and final, I think it prevented people from really accepting the right to an abortion, leading to state restrictions over time, rather than allowing the matter to truly rest."

csjj9cc,cahutchins,"The most immediate one that comes to mind are the writings of Nolan Harmon, a white Southern Methodist minister who believed in equal rights for blacks but advocated a gradual approach. In 1961 he wrote:>We have not dealt fairly with the negro in the south, my brethren. God knows we have not. I speak as a Mississippian, born and bred in that sister state. We do long for justice and peace between man and man. But I am convinced that the way to achieve this is not in some sudden assault by vast outside powers crashing into the mores and long established customs of a great people. Neither will it come about by the well-meaning, but misdirected forays of outsiders.>It will come, and come only by the slow, slow, slow process of time in which the good and upright and forward looking people of our South and nation, uncoerced by power, but impelled by their spirit, shall do away with inequity and establish what is the good. God give us, and our children's children the will to see that day.Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""Letter from Birmingham Jail"" was written in part as a direct response to Harmon's views. Harmon and people like him meant well, but if we had followed their lead in the struggle for civil rights, it would have taken *decades* for every southern state to end their Jim Crow laws. Mississippi might still have legally segregated schools to this day, if not for the intervention of the Supreme Court."
csjjkld,eye_can_do_that,"Thanks. Robert's dissent was well written; however, this gives some historical context about why it isn't such a great idea."
csjg3uc,Cryptic0677,"Sort of. He's saying that democratic process is being overridden, but to me that doesn't really matter in light of the constitution requiring equal treatment under the law. Gay marriage bans may be democratically chosen, but that doesn't make them constitutional any more than enforcing separate bathrooms for black people."
csjk7q8,,But there is equal treatment under the law. Neither gays nor straights can marry someone of the same sex. Both gays and straights can marry someone of the opposite sex. Everyone is treated equally under the law. The fact that some people are more adversely affected by the law than others does not mean it violates the fourteenth amendment. All laws affect some people more than others.
csjpwcd,Cryptic0677,"That is semantic bullshit and you know it. Black people also could use bathrooms just like white people, it was totally equal protection under the law!"
csjq0hl,,They couldn't use the same bathrooms.
csjftp2,Lord_Varys,">But he doesn't make a compelling argument for why the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment would apply to all areas of the law save one.Marriage isn't a protection. It's a special legal status. States decide to let certain people attain that status by signing a contract; they thought it benefited society to have more people married, so they incentivized it. Personally I think more benefits to more people is, well, beneficial, but it has always been for states to decide. This is a positive right: when government gives a benefit or service.This is starkly different from negative rights, or protections from government infringement. I.e. government can't limit your speech unless it causes direct threat or injury to another."
csjg8q8,,"This is just wrong. The Equal Protection Clause applies to *any* government action or inaction that draws a distinction between two or more classes of people. The question is what level of scrutiny the court will apply to those distinctions, either based on the classifications drawn or the rights burdened. Government can't choose to grant special status to white couples and not minority or intermarried couples because of the court's ruling in Loving v. Virginia. Now the same rule is applied here."
csjgsxl,Lord_Varys,"I think that's where I come around to the majority on this. Blacks should be able to use public fountains and parks, which are public services. So why can't gays get the public benefits of marriage status?I will say this opens up Polygamy as well, but I think that should be legal too. Not a slippery slope argument, just saying."
csjh73b,--o,"I don't see how that follows at all. State gives special status to two people, so it can't exclude which groups can have it. Adding more parties is not the same as not dictating who the parties are.Note how states will have to do jack all to implement this, mostly juat remove a bunch of restrictions.Polygamist marriages on the other hand would require a whole new legal framework. At that point the court would be forcing states to create new things."
csjho57,reuxin,"I was going to post the same regarding polygamy, so thank you. I'm indifferent to polygamist type relationships, but the legal framework for marriage is the essentially the same as it exists between two equal parties (well... basically). Divorce in a gay marriage is no different than divorce in a straight marriage, or interracial marriage. Divorce in a polygamist marriage would require a rethinking of the entire marriage/legal structure and would be uniquely complex requiring a whole new set of laws and adjustments to existing laws based on MANY new scenarios. I see polygamy as an entirely different animal."
csjhr2d,SithLord13,"Well, since Brown v. Buhman used the precedent from the previous overturning of DOMA to invalidate parts of the laws against polygamy, it's certainly not that far of a jump."
csji1uy,--o,"What I mean is that it doesn't follow from this particular case as it just removes a gender restriction. There is no fundamental change to how states marry people and, more importantly, how they divorce them."
csjiaw6,SithLord13,My point is the courts don't seem to agree.
csjjm8c,robodrew,"The main reason that polygamy will have a much harder time in the fight for legality vs. gay marriage is that there actually IS hard data to show that polygamic relationships can have a negative impact on the rearing of children (and equality between the sexes). That was one argument that opponents of marriage equality were trying to make concerning gay people getting married, but the data simply didn't support it."
csjjznr,,Gays can get the public benefits of marriage.
csjhcgm,aXvXiA,"How, then, is the draft constitutional?"
csjhfhp,,"Because it's not inherently unconstitutional to draw a distinction between two classes of people. It's just whether that distinction holds up to scrutiny. Gender based classifications aren't up to the same level of scrutiny as race-based ones. They're in an intermediate designation. However, this is definitely an issue to watch in the future. The draft obviously hasn't been challenged yet under the EPC, but it's possible it is not constitutional as written. To this point, many of the military's distinctions have been given incredible deference. It's not entirely clear that will persist."
csjil52,technocraticTemplar,"The court can only rule on the cases that come before it. In all likelyhood no one's bothered to sue over it yet. It makes sense given that it's a backburner issue given how long it's been since the last draft, and most women (rightfully) probably aren't itching to be drafted anyways. It's just not worth the energy when there are bigger battles to fight."
csjgy9v,mta2011,Well said. Many people supporting this dissent seem to be completely misinterpreting the EPC's role.
csjgbnc,Picksburgh,Check out *Loving v. Virginia* and *Zablocki v. Redhail* and you'll see that the Courts determined long ago that marriage is a basic civil right that States can't infringe upon.
csjgoo0,Lord_Varys,I will have to look at that. I can't imagine the logic behind it.
csji8eh,Picksburgh,"There are three general ""fundamental rights"" deeply rooted in the nation's history and tradition that they are given great deference and protection. Those are the right to travel, the right to vote, and the right to privacy. Any laws made interfering with those rights have to overcome a test of strict scrutiny (law must be necessary to further a compelling government interest (i.e. very hard to prove)).The courts have ruled over time that marriage is a [fundamental right](http://www.afer.org/blog/14-supreme-court-cases-marriage-is-a-fundamental-right/) falling under the umbrella of the right to privacy.

csjg40k,Crankyshaft,"> Marriage isn't a protection. It's a special legal status.That's not what ""protection"" means in the context of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment."
csjgawx,technocraticTemplar,"I think it's a bit different in this case because of how deeply ingrained marriage is as a human institution at this point. It's done in every modern society that I know of, and it's been a part of our culture (in one form or another) for thousands of years. Additionally, the infrastructure for marriage already exists. This isn't forcing someone to provide in a new way, it's disallowing a ban. It would be very different if they decided that the government had to provide healthcare or something like that (as an example)."

I do not think there was an equivalent swell of public opinion when re civil rights in the 50-60's which is why the Court has to push things along.

csjhmxr,Revoran,">But he doesn't make a compelling argument for why the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment would apply to all areas of the law save one.The thing is, prior to this morning, gay people in Texas (let's say) had the same legal right to marry as anyone else in Texas. Straight and gay people were both legally able to marry a person of the opposite gender.Today, the Supreme Court did a great thing. They did the *right* thing, morally. But legally I'm not so sure.Either way, what's done is done, and I'm happy for all the people who can now have their love and commitment recognised. :)"
csjhna9,TriscuitCracker,"Cannot upvote this enough. In some ways, I even agree with this dissent. It is logical, articulate, and makes legal sense. Roberts isn't some monster who hates gay people. I believe he thinks gay marriage is fine, but let the states arrive at it normally through legislative process rather than have the Supreme Court force their hand. But Equal Protection is Equal Protection. That trumps this I believe."
csjhp0j,Master_Of_Knowledge,It does work because marrige isn't a fundamental government issued rightm
csjhpoi,Explodingovary,Can you ELI5 what he is saying please?
csjhpzg,Stardustchaser,"Looking specifically at the *Loving* case, there was millennia of historical legal precedent supporting interracial marriage. Hence it was a unanimous decision.Typically the SCOTUS will look to English as well as even Roman legal tradition in inform their legal opinions. The *Loving* case was fairly clear-cut when you include that history.This is something new and truly historical. As I tell people who naively comment how the Greeks and Romans had homosexual relationships and even combat units, I point out that did not equate to societal and legal acceptance of marriage. The Roman promotion of what is seen as traditional heterosexual marriage and the family unit was up here with any crazy evangelist description today."
csjht7d,,"Thing is, our Article I branch of government (Congress) had fallen asleep at the wheel. The result is that there naturally will be increased pressure on the Article II (executive orders) and Article III (judicial activism) branches to fill in the gap."
csjht8r,mardish,"Yeah, suggesting that the court has ended the debate and locked people into their current views is incorrect. People will just stop caring, because this will no longer be a political issue that can be used to drum up conservative indignation. And in a generation, it'll be the norm and the vast majority (instead of the simple majority, as is now) will support the decision."
csji4g8,Gonzzzo,"Yea, I find it pretty interesting how Robert calls marriage a ""fundamental right"" in his dissent...and then says there's no right to change states' definition of marriage (that denied a fundamental right to a substantial portion of Americans)"
csji5j0,Gata_Melata,"Yeah, it's certainly a weird point of view. Obviously the goal of supporters of same sex marriage was always for something to happen on the legislative end of things--the whole point is no one should have to ""persuade"" others that they deserve to be treated as equals. It shouldn't stay an underground social movement, that's not what equality is about."
csjibh5,aelendel,"> rationalIt really isn't. >And a State's decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational. This is completely false. It is embarassing that he couldn't do the basic research required to discover this is false. In fact, I'm sure it was presented to him. Embarassing. Not rational. Willful ignorance of evidence."
csjidek,corey_m_snow,"> Roberts' dissent is rationalNot really. It has at its core an assumption that the definition of marriage has always been what he says it is, and that is simply not true.The rest of the argument proceeds from this flawed and incorrect assertion, making the entire argument irrational."
csjihg8,,"Because some states' definition of marriage is only heterosexual marriage. For them, there is no heterosexual marriage nor homosexual marriage, just marriage, which is defined as a male/female union.This argument isn't without merit. After all, even with the extension to gay marriage, there is still a ""definition"" of marriage that is a person/person union. Meanwhile there are people who would support a definition of marriage that includes more than 2 people, but the majority doesn't agree with that. So it's not like the Supreme Court has enforced ""equality,"" they have only enforced a certain definition of marriage which includes 2-person heterosexual and homosexual unions.There is only one reason that gay marriage is now allowed and polygamy is not, and it's that public opinion favors the former. All the arguments can apply to the latter, but they will not be heard because no one cares."
csjihtj,ubnoxious1,"Here is where I get lost in his argument:""But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority's approach is deeply disheartening""The thing is, marriage IS an invention of men (as are laws). If there are legal protections for one kind of marriage but not another; that is discrimination."
csjirde,jpfarre,"He's definitely wrong. Marriage grants lawful protections from both the federal and state level. In order for a state to declare, lawfully, that they do not recognize gay marriage they would simultaneously be required to strip any legal benefit from straight marriages. To do otherwise would be affording one class of people a right over another class of people."
csjj9of,,I don't see how the fourteenth amendment applies.
csjjcwx,robodrew,"It's really not totally rational though, for he says ""And a State's decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational."" when it is clearly not true that the modern definition of marriage has not been held the same in every culture *throughout human history*. History used to be full of marriages for property, marriages between heads of state for political reasons, arranged marriages, and a long history of polygamy, concubines, harems, etc."
csjjd82,substandardgaussian,"His dissent isn't rational, it's merely articulate. The premise that marriage is being ""redefined"" from a definition that has existed in **all** cultures for centuries is incorrect, and is a typical example of cultural erasure.It's convenient for a member of an unelected body to say that they shouldn't make a ruling due to being unelected when that ruling happens to be against his personal beliefs. Considering the extreme overreaching the SCOTUS has been involved with where he was in the majority, his position is simply comical."
csjjg80,,"they played soft for a while, now most people approve of this, and you know what, fuck the holdouts. There are still some holdouts who hate blacks and always will and don't think that every race is equal. There are still some holdouts that think women shouldn't vote or be in the workplace.Fuck them. We have to push forward and drag them behind us whining, kicking, and screaming all the way with their little tiny pea brains and their big fat noisy mouths."
csjjmex,Chrispy_Bites,"Except that his primary argument is legally incorrect. To wit, ""The fundamental right to marry does not include a right to make a State change its definition of marriage.""That precedent was set in Loving v. Virginia, when the Supreme Court ruled that Virginia's anti-miscegenation law was unconstitutional. That law *defined* marriage for the state of Virginia.I mean, without dipping into how this whole thing gets politicized, and relying on legal precedent alone, the court has always had the power to overturn state laws that were unconstitutional."
csjk3qf,Sky_Light,"He also claims that the democratic process is responsible for most of the states that legalized gay marriage, when it was the courts, not voters, that struck down most of the laws. [26 court based, 11 vote based](http://gaymarriage.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004857)"
csjk65z,,">Roberts is articulate, calm, and compassionate. But he's also wrong.I couldn't agree more. No matter what you think about gays, allowing gays to marry *is* provided by the 14th amendment. Its states that everybody is allowed to marry, or no one is. The law itself doesn't allow us to pick and choose who."
csjkmgv,PandaLover42,"Yea, so this really makes me wonder why Roberts dissented. He's smart enough to know that being gay isn't a choice, and that state bans on gay marriage fly in the face of the 14th amendment. And he's smart enough to know that our government is more than just ""democratic process"", and that minority rights are just as important. It's not like he needs to appeal to conservative voters... So why did he do it?"
csjks0t,kelustu,"Yeah, his entire section about how the arguments don't require a mandate of legal change in the States that choose wanted to remain straight-only in their marriages neglects the simple fact that ""the fundamental right to marry"" clearly means what he says it doesn't."
csjkv64,get_go,"He is wrong because, this gradual acceptance may not happen in gerrymandered red states where the majority will deny these rights to the minority. Something these traditional marriage supporter have yet to explain. How does gay marriage hurt you?"
csjlop4,Archr5,"> Roberts is articulate, calm, and compassionate. But he's also wrong.Agreed. It's almost like he's a human being or something :)"
csjlua0,Khatib,">But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority's approach is deeply disheartening.I don't think that part is rational.If you believe in a government of laws, you will see that modern marriage is a purely *legal* construct, enacted by the LAW (sometimes through ministers) with clearly legal benefits. It can also be *dissolved* through the law, which is clearly in violation of most religious definitions of it.This makes it a LEGAL issue, and in a government of law, that legal right needs to be extended to all citizens. People blocking it are doing so on an emotional and religious ground, not a legal one. He's trying to twist opposition into being about the law, but it is clearly not."
csjoj53,belunos,"He also said the federal government shouldn't be forcing the states to change their definition of marriage. I find this erroneous, as it's obviously also defined at the federal level."
csjotgf,Oranges13,"He also said this which is confusing:> The fundamental right to marry does not include a right to make a State change its definition of marriage. And a State's decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational*Every culture*? Really? I would argue that Every culture is different. Perhaps he meant Every religion? Because *some* cultures allow men to marry MULTIPLE women, or women to marry multiple men, or men to marry their daughters. WTF. He's delusional."
csjpljd,Frostiken,"The entire drama about gay marriage has been because marriage is in such a weird gray area as far as the government is concerned. It's seen as both a private and public ""institution"".If we had done the not-retarded thing long ago and set up a 'life partnership' you could enter into with any one single other person and dissolved the notion that religious 'marriages' hold any weight, it would've been a slam-dunk Constitutional victory. Marriage should be treated as nothing more than a corporation... a partnership. Honestly if it were structured in that way from the get-go, I seriously doubt as many Republicans would have any reason to complain about it."
csjpr3m,iongantas,"His argument is not rational. It is an appeal to tradition, that is all."
csjqcu0,DorkJedi,"> nd the very same argument was made by ""reasonable"" opponents of the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s, who said pretty much exactly the same thingI have long noted that the vast majority of the arguments against gay marriage are identical to the ones against interracial marriage."
csjql35,RemingtonSnatch,"He's also wrong because the philosophy behind his reasoning could be leveraged to uphold plenty of historically common social wrongs.""What's wrong with slavery? It's always BEEN a thing in virtually every culture in human history!""What WAS has no weight in the discussion of what should be.At least Roberts tried sounding reasonable, though, as opposed to Scalia's spit-riddled derp salad of cognitive dissonance and general stupidity:""To allow the policy question of same-sex marriage to be considered and resolved by a select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine is to violate a principle even more fundamental than no taxation without representation: no social transformation without representation""No, Scalia, you stupid asshole, that's not a violation of anything. That's why the Supreme Court EXISTS...to among other things help, along with the Constitution, prevent common popular idiocy from running rampant over what is just. There is nothing anywhere promising ""no social transformation without representation"". Fucking jackass, that guy..."
csjs357,irishwolfbitch,"The Civil Rights Act was passed through legislative means, voted on by the representatives of the people. The ruling here is through the Supreme Court, and when you put that arbitrary overstep of the people's say, that's when Roberts' statement makes sense."
csjsaes,cahutchins,"The Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964. But the Supreme Court ruled on Brown vs. Board of Education in 1954, ruling against states which had laws segregating black and white public schools and universities. Southern states lost their minds over this. George Wallace, the governor of Mississippi, stood in the doorway of a public university to prevent a black woman from registering for classes. The National Guard had to be called in to escort black children to school without being beaten by angry mobs.Do you believe that was an ""arbitrary overstep of the people's say""?"
csjuuh9,irishwolfbitch,"You're gonna call me a racist for thinking that states should be able to decide on social legislation? Just because something is progressive and ""the right thing to do"" doesn't set any worse of a precedent for anything else. An imbalance between federal and state authority always sews the seeds of unrest."
csjva28,cahutchins,"I'm not calling you anything, I'm simply saying that the supreme court has intervened on ""state issues"" against popular opinion or state legislation at multiple points in history. If one has a problem with the court intervening in how states define marriage, then one has to rationalize how that is different from the court intervening in how states defined who had access to public services and facilities."
csjwpqq,irishwolfbitch,"Ok, all you did was restate your point. It doesn't change the precedent that this decision is setting. If 4 of the justices state their issue is that this is not a court matter, then I have a problem with the decision, if a large minority doesn't think it should be settle there."

csjvdoa,TheDerkman,It's the Confederate-Republican ideal of State's rights trumping Federal law. The only problem though is throughout history it has almost exclusively been used as a tool to promote hate and bigotry.The one instance in which it hasn't would have to be States legalizing Marijuana while it is still illegal on a Federal level.
csjwm0p,wsdmskr,Except that marriage is not a governmental institution.
csjwx5m,cahutchins,"Marriage as most modern societies define it are two things simultaneously:* A religious institution which primarily concerns two people and the religious community they choose to associate with.* A legal institution which primarily concerns two people and the governments they live under, and which provides a variety of legal privileges and obligations, like tax breaks, rights of inheritance, legal authority in medical decisions, etc.At a certain point in the 90's and 00's, gay rights advocates argued that those two institutions should be made separate, that the government should recognize ""civil unions"" between both hetro- and homosexual adult couples, and that ""marriages"" should have no legal bearing whatsoever, and could be defined by different religious communities in any way they wished.It was conservative Christians who originally opposed the concept of civil unions, and demanded that marriage should continue to include legal rights and protections. By doing that, they guaranteed that eventually the institution of marriage would fall under the scrutiny of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, and ultimately opened to same sex couples.Had conservatives embraced the idea of decoupling ""legal marriage,"" from ""religious marriage,"" we wouldn't be where we are today."

Then again, I'm a layman and hate reading wordy passages the government loves to write."

csjfu90,walk_through_this,"You know, I have to disagree with the principle put forward here. I have gone back and forth on this issue personally, for reasons rooted in my faith. But there's a couple of things that's made me realize:1. I can't really force my faith on others, that doesn't work on any level.2. I really disagree with the 'democratic' approach to a question of human rights. To quote (then) Cardinal Ratzinger, (who is now... anyone... anyone? you at the back? Pope Benedict, that's correct) ""**Truth cannot be decided by popular vote.**"" It should not be left up to the masses to decide who should have what rights and who shouldn't. This decision does belong with the courts, not the ballot boxes."
csjfy7o,walk_through_this,"And for the record, in the final analysis, I am happy with the decision.

That's on me, not the courts or the LGBT community."
csjg445,moorsonthecoast,"Other obligations to the Catholic include: 1. Being robustly involved in the political process. 2. Never being satisfied with falsehood. 3. Holding that the rule of law should be founded in eternal divine law. The state made the wrong decision. Then again, the state is a post-Protestant nation, and is mission territory.

Luckily this country has checks and balances and a separation of powers just for this very reason. You would think the dissenters would be aware of that.
csjjg03,,"Actually, states rights arguments do sometimes involve enacting more liberal standards than federal law.Example: Weed, gunsI'm sure there's more, but honestly supreme court decisions have eviscerated the 10th amendment, there really isn't much states *can* do anymore due to ridiculous decisions such as: All trade anywhere falls under federal authority, which makes the above (good things in my opinion) fruitless arguments."

csjgsmg,eatgoodneighborhood,"When it comes to discrimination, fuck states rights. And I'm big on states rights."

csjgqai,rackcs,"I agree. It sounds good in theory and would ideally be the method we use.

csjff3r,pyrosol08,"The rights of minorities should not be subject to the opinion of the majority. <--- Don't hate me, but in reading the justice's dissent, this argument you're making works both ways.... that one state that hasn't legalized it would be pushed by the majority who had to legalize it, but that change could happen with the people more so than simply federally demanding the state legalize... it's a very complicated issue. I for one am very happy for the win today for the gay community, it's pretty awesome to be alive in a time where this is happening, but (at this this dissenting opinion) the judge's opinion does make a lot of sense"
csjfvmm,ozzimark,">this argument you're making works both waysBut not really, because the state itself doesn't care if gay people can be married or not. The residents of that state do.

csjh6ln,Ownerjfa,"That's exactly it. To the state, marriage is a legal contract, nothing more. If an individual (such a church group) doesn't want to perform a marriage ceremony for a gay couple, that's fine. They don't have to.

I've told people that it's not like their churches are now being forced to perform marriages. they can still pick and choose based on religion, church membership, or moral standings. the day that churches are forced to perform marriages is the day I stand with them in protest, even as a non-churchgoer. you cannot infringe on someones religion and it's not happening here.

And a State's decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational. This may be carefully worded, but ultimately the phrase ""the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history"" is disingenuous at best, and a complete fallacy at worst.

Even ignoring the more philosophical angle that _right now_ is part of human history, there's a lengthy and complex tale of various kinds of marriage and various aspects of the extant kinds of marriage changing over time. Even this ""traditional meaning of marriage"" he intends to refer to has been altered dramatically over the 19th and 20th century: it was once plain and common knowledge that the definition of marriage included [coverture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverture), and you better believe that _that_ was irrational. The purpose and goal of the Supreme Court isn't to ""show whether the people of the country are supportive or not"" on a given topic. It's to rule as to the effect of the law, which can have considerable nuance, especially with regard to the Constitution as applied on the federal level. They did their job."
csjhvb5,bcdm,"Let alone the part where *Loving v. Virginia* has already changed the definition of marriage in several states 50 years ago, and that argument has no leg to stand on in just America, much less ""every culture throughout human history""."
csjfxu0,TrynnaFindaBalance,"*Loving v Virginia* struck down anti-""race mixing"" laws in 17 states that had not yet repealed them (all of the former Confederacy plus Oklahoma). Was that too soon? Given that it took states like South Carolina and Alabama over 30 years after that to officially amend their Constitutions - and even then ~40% of their population voted against interracial marriage - is it more ""meaningful"" to make people who are disadvantaged under discriminatory laws wait decades for every single state legislature to change their mind?Someone my age in Mississippi or Louisiana could be waiting til age 50 or 60 to have an officially recognized marriage in their state, along with all the benefits that come with one. Is that just?"
csjgewx,SCM1992,"Not to the minority, no. But the point of democracy is to represent the interests of the many, not the few. And only the interests of those in the state, not other states. My point is that forcing a state to comply with something against their will is immoral, despite what is being forced. Let them reap what they sow. While the rest if us bathe in weed and gay money they can have their religiosity, if thats what most people in that state want."
csjhu62,FarashaSilver,"But the US is not a democracy in the fashion that you are arguing. The US is a Constitutional Republic, which means two things:1. The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and all other laws must conform with the Constutition and2. Rule of law is written by Congress, defined by the Supreme Court, and enforced by the office of the President. The ""people's majority"" does not enter into that process except when electing representatives.The court's decision here didn't say ""same sex marriage is legal."" What the court's decision stated was that, under the equal protections clause of the 14th amendment, it was unconstitutional to *deny* a benefit to some people which was extended to other people. They are striking down a group of unconstitutional laws, not legislating from the bench. The only thing they are ""forcing"" the state to do is apply marriage benefits equally across all couples regardless."
csji77n,chocoholicsoxfan,"So by that logic, polygamy should absolutely be next because the benefits of polyamorous people are being denied, right? It's ok if you think yes, I'm not saying polygamy is bad.But if you think the 14th amendment upholds gay marriage and not polygamous marriage based on denial of rights, you're a hypocrite. And I doubt the Supreme Court would vote the same way as they did today, though I might be wrong.Pretending that good feelings didn't play a role in their decision is disingenuous."
csjj44t,TrynnaFindaBalance,"Ah, the good old slippery slope argument. Knew that would come out somewhere."
csjjsp9,chocoholicsoxfan,"It's not a slippery slope because *I* don't think there's anything wrong with legalizing polygamous marriages. I would just hope that the SCOTUS feels the same, for the sake of consistency in their decisions and constitutionality. It was just a little thought experiment, is all.Actually, you're coming off as pretty judgmental of polygamous people here by implying there's a slope to slide down. It's not like I'm advocating for that woman who married the Berlin Wall."
csjihri,FarashaSilver,"I don't see any reason why marriage benefits can't apply to more than two people. There's no legal reason why not, besides it being a pain in the ass when it comes to divorce/dissolution of the union or child custody. But something being a pain in the ass is no reason to make it illegal.> Pretending that good feelings didn't play a role in their decision is disingenuous.I don't see why this is a problem? *Brown v. Board*, *Loving v. Virginia*, *Tinker v. Des Moines* all involved an emotional component about what liberty and the protection of it means. Regardless of the emotional language in the majority opinion, though, the fact remains that this was a decision based on the Constitution and it upheld equal protection."
csjfcg0,RoboChrist,"It would be more meaningful, but it is an injustice to ban same sex marriage anywhere. Gay couples who are unable to marry should not be a sacrifice on the altar of ""meaningful progress"".Justice today is more important than waiting for the rest of society to catch up with the modern world."
csjqutz,palfas,Justice delayed is justice denied
csjf75q,peppermint-kiss,And how many people would have suffered immeasurably in the waiting?
csjfo7g,hsahj,"People have died and watched their loved ones die waiting for this. There have been plenty of cases where couples living together for decades are unable to see each other at the hospital as one lay dying because they weren't technically married. And they wre not afforded the protection of their assets when they died so their partners dealt with additional shit that married couples get for granted. I think people keep forgetting that marriage is not just a feel good institutuon, it is a legal one, with a huge slough of legal bemefits."
csjfxg4,peppermint-kiss,My point exactly.
csjgw9d,SCM1992,You obviously have never been married... /sAnecdotal evidence is not reason enough to change national policy based on societal whims.
csjfop9,Kronos9898,"And will they not suffer now? Do you think that the supreme court waving its hand will make all the homophobes suddenly stop? Look at abortion, look at how it restricted. Instead of something that would probably have been resolved in the next 10 years, this will start another culture war that will last for 50, mark my words."
csjgbet,DJSlambert,It's not about haters hating. Haters gonna hate. It's about fairly getting the benefits that marriage offers.
csjg29v,peppermint-kiss,"Opposition to both abortion and gay marriage came from the same place: hyper-funding of conservative think tanks to find issues that rile people up and distract them from issues they actually care about, like the economy and foreign wars. If we keep people focused on wedge issues, we can essentially work for corporations and no one will be the wiser. Before these think tanks started developing that data, conservatism was dying in the US.There are very compelling reasons to suspect that the culture wars are in the last throes, and will vanish within the next decade or so. Then we can expect another ~20 years of relative political harmony focused on increasingly strong beneficial institutions like we experienced in the late 40s, 50s, and early 60s. After that we can expect a new resurgence of political rebellion akin to the civil rights movement, although what topic will drive it is yet to be seen."
csjfjz5,i_hate_yams,It doesn't matter you can't just break all the rules because a few will suffer. This kinda thinking would be disastrous in the long run.
csjfwyl,peppermint-kiss,What rules did they break???
csjg2g6,i_hate_yams,I'm not saying they did in this particular instance. I'm just saying the court (along with the other branches) can't over step their bounds just because some people are going to suffer. That would completely destroy the balance of powers.
csjg486,peppermint-kiss,"I do agree with you on that, I just don't think the argument ""well we should just wait until everyone gets onboard emotionally before we uphold the rights of minorities"" holds water."
csjg738,i_hate_yams,"I don't think that was the point he was trying to make I read it as just because minorities are being ""discriminated"" against we can't step in because marriage laws aren't within our jurisdiction. Therefor it needs to wait until the states uphold said rights since that is their power not ours. (aka when they get on board)"
csjgh1l,peppermint-kiss,"But any law made within the United States has to abide by the Equal Protection clause, and it's the Supreme Court's job to evaluate whether individual laws do or not. They've decided that banning marriage between any two consenting adults does not abide by the Equal Protection clause, which is perfectly within their rights to do so."
csjglaj,i_hate_yams,Marriage isn't a law it is an reorganization of a relationship by a state.
csjhe74,peppermint-kiss,"Not true, marriage is a legal contract. Laws banning two citizens from both voluntarily entering into the contract violate the constitution, according to this supreme court ruling."
csjhhyy,i_hate_yams,Yea meant to say recognition but same thing. I agree with the ruling I just see the merit in the other opinion.
csjhrh5,Stardustchaser,The latest example of activism vs. restraint in learning the concept.
csjfcjz,Valendr0s,To doubt that this is a federal issue is just naive. The examples provided in the court's opinion are a small subset of the numerous ways that the states variegated laws on this issue were causing real harm.
csjflmp,Ah_Q,"> it doesn't do anything to show that the people of this country are any more supportive of equalityWhile that may be true, it's also somewhat beside the point."
csjfma1,sveitthrone,"No, regular polling shows that people in this country are more supportive of gay marriage."
csjgh7v,SCM1992,"But not all, and those dissenting are probably in the holdout states."
csjh9dd,sveitthrone,"This is the purpose of the Supreme Court, though. It's no different than any other case the Supreme Court has ruled on. Acting as if this is some sort of power grab by SCOTUS is disingenuous. This isn't an issue of whether or not beer growlers are a fundamental right, or if one city can enact a ban on loud music. This is an issue that effects the status of a large section of the population, from basic decency to something as trivial as insurance payouts. There was no way this wasn't going to go to SCOTUS."
csjfo5y,SaxifrageRussel,"The only example I could point to off the top of my head is Switzerland, where voting rights were decided by canton (state). The final barrier to women voting was brought down in... 1990, after over 100 of arguing. So maybe not the best idea."
csjggmn,SCM1992,But does anyone still think it's a bad idea?
csjhh0c,SaxifrageRussel,"I mean, it's not a third world hellhole because women couldn't vote in a few cantons for 100 years. The Swiss would rather something take longer and be done the right way, that's for sure.Edit: Also, they voted down women's suffrage nationally at least once."
csjg2lu,Yellow_Odd_Fellow,"> While this achieves that goal rapidly, it doesn't do anything to show that the people of this country are any more supportive of equality.Would you have been okay had the SCOTUS NOT enforced and mandated de-segregation? I mean, surely the south would have eventually (maybe in 2010) allowed blacks to use the same restrooms as whites?This was needed. Just like de-segregation was needed to be a decision by SCOTUS>"
csjg7qg,Goldar85,I think the gay couples who can now marry their partners of 50 years care a little more more about that than exactly how their right came to be.
csjg930,UrukHaiGuyz,"This is the same terrible argument used by those wanted to delay and fight desegregation. At some point, if there exists blatant inequality of the law, it is far better to move the country forward than to wait for the last stragglers to come to their senses."
csjgn7j,Ownerjfa,"Roberts is forgetting the fact that this court case was originally brought to the Supreme Court by people Opposing gay marriage.http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_6j37.pdfIf memory serves, they were the ones to try to force people who were gay not get married by using the Supreme Court, not the other way around. So though I agree with Roberts in what he said, he did skew the facts as to who's attempt it was to utilize the Supreme Court."
csjh0h7,boxer_rebel,how much longer do you think segregation would have lasted had Brown v Board of Education been ruled in favor of state's rights?
csjhfbu,SCM1992,I dunno. But we might not have this barely hidden racist bullshit still floating around.

csjfgqd,EdMcMuffin,People's equality or rights shouldn't hinge on the votes of other people. You're either equal or not. You either have a right or you don't. It should not be up to others if you do or do not. If that was the case we would still have slavery because most Americans approved of it. Segregation would still exist. Interracial marriages would still be illegal and so on.
csjgrwr,SCM1992,"You're right. But since thats not how our country has been we need to vote to change those laws. And a states interests should be representative of their constituencies, not national sentiment. If a backwards state doesn't want to allow ssm, so he it and fuck them. They'll lose out on business and innovators and pay a pretty high price for it."
csjh4l1,EdMcMuffin,"That's one of the jobs of the Supreme Court. They rule on laws to make sure they are constitutional. That's what they did here, as they have done before. They ruled that bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional. The system worked as it's supposed to."
csjg041,Azthioth,"Very much agree. I know it is a beat to death horse, but this argument from Kennedy could be said for any passionate person towards any other semi sentient being, including a 15 year old. When we make a sweeping law such as this, we open doors. You can deny it and say it won't happen, but it will.Using societies approval of same sex marriage to sway state law would be far more effective than forcing it down their throats. It would give time for acceptance and normalcy, now, anyone and everyone can fight for a ""marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death.""We have let out agendas get in the way of sense."

If a same-sex couple has the constitutional right to marry because their children would otherwise “suffer the stigma of knowing their families are somehow lesser,” ante, at 15, why wouldn't the same reasoning apply to a family of three or more persons raising children? If not having the opportunity to marry “serves to disrespect and subordinate” gay and lesbian couples, why wouldn't the same “imposition of this disability,” ante, at 22, serve to disrespect and subordinate people who find fulfillment in polyamorous relationships?"

csjrewe,iamagainstit,how does this opinion square with Loving V. Virginia?
csjtj8l,moorsonthecoast,"From the same dissent. **TL, DR:** Not germane. **Slightly longer:** ""None of the laws at issue in those cases purported tochange the core definition of marriage as the union of aman and a woman."" > This Court's precedents have repeatedly describedmarriage in ways that are consistent only with its traditionalmeaning. Early cases on the subject referred tomarriage as “the union for life of one man and one woman,”Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 U. S. 15, 45 (1885), whichforms “the foundation of the family and of society, withoutwhich there would be neither civilization nor progress,”Maynard v. Hill, 125 U. S. 190, 211 (1888). We laterdescribed marriage as “fundamental to our very existenceand survival,” an understanding that necessarily implies aprocreative component. Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 12(1967); see Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316U. S. 535, 541 (1942). More recent cases have directlyconnected the right to marry with the “right to procreate.”Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U. S. 374, 386 (1978). ...>As the majority notes, some aspects of marriage havechanged over time. Arranged marriages have largelygiven way to pairings based on romantic love. States havereplaced coverture, the doctrine by which a married manand woman became a single legal entity, with laws thatrespect each participant's separate status. Racial restrictionson marriage, which “arose as an incident toslavery” to promote “White Supremacy,” were repealed bymany States and ultimately struck down by this Court. Loving, 388 U. S., at 6–7. >The majority observes that these developments “werenot mere superficial changes” in marriage, but rather“worked deep transformations in its structure.” Ante, at6–7. They did not, however, work any transformation inthe core structure of marriage as the union between a manand a woman. If you had asked a person on the street howmarriage was defined, no one would ever have said, “Marriageis the union of a man and a woman, where the womanis subject to coverture.” The majority may be right thatthe “history of marriage is one of both continuity andchange,” but the core meaning of marriage has endured.Ante, at 6.>B>Shortly after this Court struck down racial restrictionson marriage in Loving, a gay couple in Minnesota sought amarriage license. They argued that the Constitutionrequired States to allow marriage between people of thesame sex for the same reasons that it requires States toallow marriage between people of different races. TheMinnesota Supreme Court rejected their analogy to Loving,and this Court summarily dismissed an appeal.Baker v. Nelson, 409 U. S. 810 (1972).>When the majority turns to the law, it relies primarilyon precedents discussing the fundamental “right to marry.”Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 95 (1987); Zablocki,434 U. S., at 383; see Loving, 388 U. S., at 12. These cases do not hold, of course, that anyone who wants to get marriedhas a constitutional right to do so. They insteadrequire a State to justify barriers to marriage as thatinstitution has always been understood. In Loving, theCourt held that racial restrictions on the right to marrylacked a compelling justification. In Zablocki, restrictionsbased on child support debts did not suffice. In Turner,restrictions based on status as a prisoner were deemedimpermissible.>None of the laws at issue in those cases purported tochange the core definition of marriage as the union of aman and a woman. The laws challenged in Zablocki andTurner did not define marriage as “the union of a man anda woman, where neither party owes child support or is inprison.” Nor did the interracial marriage ban at issue inLoving define marriage as “the union of a man and awoman of the same race.” See Tragen, Comment, StatutoryProhibitions Against Interracial Marriage, 32 Cal.L. Rev. 269 (1944) (“at common law there was no ban oninterracial marriage”); post, at 11–12, n. 5 (THOMAS, J.,dissenting). Removing racial barriers to marriage thereforedid not change what a marriage was any more thanintegrating schools changed what a school was. As themajority admits, the institution of “marriage” discussed inevery one of these cases “presumed a relationship involvingopposite-sex partners.” Ante, at 11.>In short, the “right to marry” cases stand for the importantbut limited proposition that particular restrictionson access to marriage as traditionally defined violate dueprocess. These precedents say nothing at all about a rightto make a State change its definition of marriage, which isthe right petitioners actually seek here. See Windsor, 570U. S., at ___ (ALITO, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 8) (“WhatWindsor and the United States seek . . . is not the protectionof a deeply rooted right but the recognition of a verynew right.”). Neither petitioners nor the majority cites a single case or other legal source providing any basis forsuch a constitutional right. None exists, and that isenough to foreclose their claim."

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"
csjnums,LeeHyori,"That doesn't change anything, really, because it would just be equal protections of gay marriage between men and women. It would only be in violation of equal protections, in their view, if some men and women were not allowed to get married and some were.The point is whether the states have the right, by democratic process, to determine the definition of ""marriage"" within their boundaries. The dissenting opinion holds that, even though they might personally agree that every state should include gay marriage in their definition of marriage, the Supreme Court has no right to decide on that definition for the states. In the dissenting opinion, the justices go over examples that show that the court is not supposed to apply any substantive interpretation to what it means for there to be equal protection, etc. They just have to take the laws that exist within their given definitions, whether they be rights enumerated in the Constitution or in the constitutions/laws of individual states, and determine whether they are being applied uniformly according to their definitions. And, again, the definitions of marriage were only between man and woman in many of these states. Forcing a definition change, then, would represent a ""substantive"" move on part of the court, and they take it that this is not within the power of the court to do (even if they may personally agree with the substance of the change). These substantive changes in definition, on the dissent's view, is up to the people of each state, and is to be determined by a democratic process."
csjp11d,Karl_Marxxx,Thank you for this informed comment.
csjzmij,athennna,"Yes, but that wasn't relevant to the case at hand, right? I didn't think they were arguing equal protection.It does seem that this is an instance where the Court decides to ""legislate from the bench"", which is pretty bad in the eyes of the law. However, it's tough to fault them because it's obviously an issue that needed to be addressed and precedent set. It just sucks that this couldn't come from Congress like it's supposed to because they're fucking incapable of getting things done."
csjzs8e,tempest_87,"The 14th amendment is what the majority used for this ruling. Which is the equal protection clause. Therefore, the majority deemed this *was* about equal protection under the law. The dissenting side disagreed and thought it was judicial overreach. But as I see no conditionals (""except for..."") in the 14th amendment, I disagree with their stance. The law says equal protections with no qualifiers. Marriage is a state recognized union that grants rights and protections to those in that union. By denying the marriage of two people of the same sex, the state was not providing equal protections and thus violating the 14th amendment."

csjmma4,brgerd,From a purely legal viewpoint that would make sense to me. I think equal protection mandates that any benefits or detriments that occur legally through the process of traditional marriage definitions must also be applied to gay marriage to avoid discrimination. But if theoretically state and federal governments completely ignored marriage as a factor altering status I don't know what the claim would be for equal protection and would think that have distinctions between marriages and civil unions may be considered permissible.
csjj708,PM_ME_OR_PM_ME,"Different scenario because race is a clear suspect class. In this case, homosexuality has been assumed but not proven to fit criteria."
csjfsgy,psychosus,He's not correct. Previous federal case precedent has superseded the right of a state in instances where the state is discriminating against a group. The majority does not get to vote to violate the rights of a minority just because of states' rights.

csjmnsr,psychosus,"Neither one of us is a constitutional lawyer, so *neener-neener* to your buffoon remark. Seems like some (many) people with a constitutional law background disagree with you on the scrutiny issue. Especially since the Windsor ruling. Oh, and after today's ruling."
csjfqf6,Lucretiel,"Okay, but the SCOTUS *does* have a history of preventing tyranny of the majority, by ruling on racial and gender equality cases. How is this different than any civil rights ruling?"
csjfx5q,DrunkenOni,"I'm not a legal scholar but most of those rulings are made based on the 14th amendment I believe, which makes it constitutional and within the realm of the federal government. Which is the argument used here."
csjh15f,psychosus,If you're not a legal scholar then why be so confident in Roberts' dissent being completely correct? You don't have to be a legal scholar to see that it's totally wrong and flies in the face of previous case law.
csjfzhl,rocketvat,"I don't think either of you actually articulated a reason why we should allow states to discriminate against couples applying for the legal protections of marriage. Stopping states from discriminating IS in the purview of the supreme court, and being bigoted has never been a valid ""state right""."
csjjfey,Mic_Check_One_Two,"Marriage is a state's right, but this issue was about the 14th amendment, which basically says that every citizen should be treated equally. The opposition basically argued ""yeah, every person should be treated equally *except* for marriage."" The SCOTUS rolled their eyes at that, because it's the exact same argument that had been used to discriminate against other groups in the past. And if you read the dissenting opinions, *they don't counter the argument that the 14th amendment is universal, and applies to things like marriage*. They simply gripe about things like ""it isn't the SCOTUS's place to decide this"" and ""the majority justices are egotistical."" They *know* that they can't counter that argument, so they resort to deflecting the issue and personal attacks instead."
csjfqxe,masterelmo,"Once marriage became somewhat of a federal institution, states kinda lost the right to dictate all over it."
csjg6yt,wmlloydfloyd,But equal protection *is* enumerated in the Constitution. This decision simply says that the need for equal protection trumps the state's right to define marriage however it wants. It's only a federalism issue insofar as the Constitution prevents the States from infringing on the rights of the individual.
csjgma9,InvalidFileInput,"The Constitution currently provides for Income taxation as a Federal authority, and under that authority, Congress has established rules predicated on marriage. That firmly places decisions about marriage (and the subsequent application of those rules) at the Federal level so long as that authority and those rules remain in place and legally binding."
csjm8u2,demontaoist,"Well it's wrong about the universality of heterosexual marriage. >The supreme court seems to pick and choose when it likes to apply state's rights or not (and to be fair, has done so for a long time).Isn't that how the supreme court works? Isn't that a major part of its purpose? States cannot have absolute authority over rights. That is the opposite of how rights work. The USA doesn't even have authority to dictate rights, theoretically. Which is ironic, because the USA absolutely has the power the dictate rights. Which is doubly ironic because we control the human rights regime, but we make sure basically nothing in international law applies to us. Anyway...."

csjgkva,,"States don't have the right to discriminate, that has been established for a long time. The majority decision stated that states are violating the liberty of gay people by not allowing them to marry."
csjgur2,FireHazard11,The states aren't allowed to violate the 14th amendment. The 14th guarantees equal protections for every person. The Supreme Court has used this exact same logic to strike down bans on interracial marriages in the past. Using it to strike down bans on same sex marriage isn't any different.
csjfr0b,terrymr,States are still bound by the constitution which requires equal treatment for all.

csjh89x,,"Exactly my point. Also, the Fourteenth Amendment seems to plainly allow for gay marriage. It was always blind prejudice, not jurisprudence, that prevented this outcome from happening sooner."
csjhqso,scottcmu,"Marriage is not defined in the constitution, and therefore I believe the states should have the right to define marriage for themselves. The law can then be applied equally. Realistically though, I don't think the government should be defining marriage at any level. It should be a private institution."
csjisee,bananasluggers,"Where do you draw the line regarding equal vs. state rights. In other words, how unfair would a state law have to be for you to agree with a Supreme Court intervention?"
csjiwf6,scottcmu,"Good point. Still, I don't think the government should be defining marriage."
csjhmon,TezzMuffins,"It doesn't really make sense in the context of Loving, though. What makes interracial marriage any different from gay marriage? Although running after children this morning made it so I couldn't read the full dissent, maybe he covered it."

csjfshd,tempest_87,"The reason you disagree with it is because while change to laws should be done through legislature as he mentions (and most people agree with), gay marriage is an application of the equal protection clauses, not a change of law.It's really that simple. As marriage is a state recognized union with benefits, responsibilities, and protections, one state cannot be different than another. And as the constitution makes not definition of marriage, it must apply equally to all who are at the age of consent."
csjf7z7,i_hate_yams,Honestly the first part makes sense the last bit is stupid
csjex25,DrOddcat,"What condescending garbage. Calling his colleagues on the court ""five lawyers"""
csjf2c4,moorsonthecoast,"Well, if you're in the habit of reading things in the worst possible light, you can come to that conclusion. I think, though, that it would be in character for Roberts to describe the dissenters as ""four lawyers."" It's more like, ""what are we all to be worthy to presume to wield such power as to ignore precedent"" and less ""these five unworthies dare to disagree with me."" EDIT: As a matter of fact, Scalia says exactly ""nine lawyers"" in his dissent. >Today's decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court."
csjfjwm,majinspy,"I agree. But those are the 9 lawyers we appointed via our presidents to figure this shit out for us. I think is opinion is very valid, I also think the idea if an expanding and adapting 14th amendment is also valid. Court cases like brown v board and Lawrence v Texas are not seen as mistakes. This one won't either."
csjhson,TezzMuffins,"He says ""lawyers"" to strengthen the rhetorical image he is trying to present. It would be fair to say he would call himself a 'lawyer' as well, because he is painting a picture that the court has no right to subvert the will of the states and the people in them, and downplaying the gravity of his profession helps strengthen the thrust of his argument.In full disclosure, I don't agree with his argument because I don't see how he can get that to mesh with Loving, but he is not trying to insult the majority."

csjfhoj,moorsonthecoast,"This ain't Scalia we're talking about, you know. Roberts has more class than that, and is more dispassionate."
csjf7fu,Moruitelda,"That's what they are. Very well read lawyers, very experienced lawyers, very bright lawyers, and very powerful lawyers, but still... it was five lawyers who decided it."
csjfg3p,ColombianHugLord,"I haven't read many Supreme Court decisions and dissents, but from the few I have read this is pretty common language."
csjhop3,dgrant92,"Well its law they are deciding on. Who would you rather have, Doctors? Engineers? IT folk? This IS law they are deciding on, the proper interpretation of the most import law we have, the US Constitution. And you need lawyers for that job."
csjideq,Moruitelda,"Well, I mean, I am a lawyer so you're kind of preaching to the choir here. But his argument is more along the lines that when five individuals substitute their judgment for the electorate, we become a less democratic nation. That's an important reason for SCOTUS to exercise judicial restraint... although I think their ruling was important, here."
csjl0a5,dgrant92,"Yes, I feel this is about basic civil rights guaranteed everyone by our Constitution and should not be subjected to a popular vote or any individual states political opinion and resulting laws against these basic human rights. The SCOTUS needed to get this set straight once and for all. This isn't being an activist court imo, this is the court defining and defending our constitution and what it promises every single one of us."
csjf7y3,fireinthesky7,"I don't see it that way. He does make a good point, even if I do disagree with it; proponents of classical small government and states' rights would be outraged by any decision that allowed the federal government to mandate something like this. The argument for letting democracy run its course is a good one, but we all know there are a number of states where that was never going to happen. However, I, and apparently the five justices in the majority, are of the belief that human rights trump states' rights."
csjfcl0,lolmonger,"The dissent exists because Roberts is calling out the use and expected function of the Supreme Court to be a trump card of policy making, whereby so long as the balance of Executives control the Circuit spread and tilt of the Supremes, you can totally subvert the entire Legislative process by deciding issues in terms of rulings on Constitutionality.>Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebrationHe's not saying "", *because I join with them in it*"", but he's not exactly being subtle here, either.His problem isn't with same sex marriage - - his problem is with five unelected people in Judiciary having the power to assume such a fundamental function of Legislative branch.That's his gripe, and it's hardly an unimportant one."
csjfbq6,PenguinHero,It's actually quite intentional and fair. He's using that phrase to show how ridiculous he thinks it is that 5 human beings are making a decision to enforce change upon millions. That's hardly democratic and that's his core point. You don't have to agree with someone to at least try and understand their point of view you know.
csjfom3,faue,"I mean, isn't that sort of the job of the Supreme Court? To rule in cases of dispute which often affect the entire country?"
csjfylr,PenguinHero,"Well disputes relating to Laws of the country, yes. In this case the dissenting Justices have basically said the Constitution did not specify marriage in any way and it's not their job to decide it for the country. The States then have every right to decide whatever the people want and that democratic process should have been allowed to continue.At least that's if I'm understanding their dissent accurately. I stand to be corrected."
csjgecm,faue,"I suppose that's understandable. It just comes off as incredibly whiny, even within the context, which surprises me since Roberts' opinions are usually written in neutral terms, but perhaps I'm reading his tone incorrectly."
csjfa3u,nyurf_nyorf,"I 100% support gay marriage and have even offered to marry a few after I got ordained, but he does have a point when he talks about the end of the democratic process to change the law. It was inevitable that the law would naturally change as differing views (literally) died and a more liberal view took its place. It was great to see polls creep up and acceptance become more the norm, but now I fear there's going to a backlash. Not one that will reverse the law or decision, but a backlash nonetheless. However, that in no way means I think the court did something wrong. It's a fantastic day."
csjflwu,i_hate_yams,They are all lawyers. Most all of the nine have immense respect for each other.

We want gay marriage legal and now its legal right? What happens when we have new justices who interpret the constitution differently?"

Not to say equal rights isn't a real issue, because it is. My point is more, I'd like the ""conservative side"" that I suppose I begrudgingly *align* myself with I suppose to quit bitching about this and making it this platform piece to try and rally the nuts who get all riled up about it. This shouldn't have been an issue for as long as it was. Ok, I'm a conservative, whatever that may mean with respect to gay rights. Who am I to try and dictate, via legislation, what others do in their own private lives. Conservatives and liberals both need to quit arguing on these party lines because that's the problem, there are problems with both political parties and we all need to realize that compromises need to be made by both sides and on even larger issues so that something truly meaningful can be accomplished in many different arenas. So I'm glad that this was able to happen and I hope that other similar things can happen to actually effect change in our government.Maybe now that this has been rightfully decided, we can put this issue to bed and move on to running this country and fixing issues that are potentially more impactful people on both sides of this argument like the economy and corporate and government corruption and abuse of power."

I could use the word bigot as a replacement however I didn't want to go that far yet here we are. Thank you.People I called idiots are the ones in the streets holding up signs, chanting hateful words, physically assaulting or intimidating people, or making backhanded remarks that affect others around them. Those people are idiots and they will call me an idiot for supporting equality. It's their right to do that just like its my right to call them idiots.As for experiences, I have seen plenty of times where gay couples couldn't see each others in hospitals, get insurance, paying more in taxes, or couldnt get life insurance policies.Having to comfort to someone because they couldn't see their dying partner (because the hospital refused entry) then hearing that they had pass away when we were in the lobby is something no human should ever have to experience. People who support that are bigots, assholes, and idiots. And the fact that you have taken time to call me 'naive' / 'idiot' (most likely to get this kind of reaction out of me) makes you a horrible human being.I will end my argument with this... I personally don't care you think I am stupid / an idiot. I watched a major event that directly impacts me and my family for the better, gives closure to my friends, and promotes equality. That is good enough for me. Have fun with your hatefill / narrow minded response in which you try to insult me again."

Gay couples may be getting equal dignity, compared to hetero *couples*. However, some of the laws are not fair to singles, e.g., taxes. They should of taken the law out of marriage if they cared for justice and rights. You don't need the law to love someone. If that's not bad enough, the Constitution has not, does not, and cannot grant rights. To say that it does completely misses the equal and just nature of rights. It can acknowledge and seek to protect rights, but cannot ever grant them. Can you grant equality or fairness? No! The best you can do is define and effect conditions such that those result."

csjgvmk,-bojangles,"Im a Christian, and I try my best to find love for everyone whether they've done wrong to me or not. Christianity is a religion, as taught by Christ (not the Crusaders and inquisition), of love and acceptance.What this means to me is that NO ONE is without sin as it is defined in the bible....and no sin is greater than another in the eyes of God. Gay marriage is an extremely grey area for me, as I understand homosexuality to be a sin in the eyes of God, but so is being a liar, and an adulterer. It seems to me that homosexuality in the Christian religion has been the most chastised sin of all, while some others have been overlooked or even ignored and allowed to carry on with little to no consequence.Liars, adulterers, murderers and idolaters are married everyday. Who am I, a sinner in my own right, to explicitly deny another the right to marry? Their judgment, if they are indeed Christian, is ultimately between them and God. My job as a Christian, as defined by Christ, is to spread the Gospel, study his word and treat all as children of God.Me and several other from my local church have a bible study once a week. There is an active Gay man in our group and he is treated no differently than anyone else. I love him as a brother and would defend his right to live his life.I know this post may be down voted to oblivion because I have defined homosexuality as a sin, but this is not my definition, it's the definition my religion teaches, and It's the religion I follow.This decision by SCOTUS is a huge step in human rights here in the U.S."

csjhj9j,-bojangles,"Did I say somewhere at I didn't follow its guidelines? I follow the guidelines of my religion as depicted by Christ, not the church I attend or anyone else."
csjhouf,Jfreak7,"No, but you said that you didn't make the definition, you just follow. So it's a ""I didn't make the rules, I just have to follow them"" sort of thing? If you define homosexuality as a sin, I would assume you agree with the definition. I guess what you are also saying is that, it doesn't really matter how you would define it, the rules have been set. The universe isn't a Democracy. We can't petition and vote to change the rules sort of thing...Is that right?"
csji0y1,-bojangles,"I'm not sure where you're going with this, but I'm guessing you're asking me if I just blindly follow directions? The answer is no. I believe what Christ came to teach us is that sin is part of the human definition. We are sinful by nature in every way the Bible depicts what a sin is. The difference? Christ accepted these sins and came to spread the message of forgiveness and mercy, and was a sacrifice for or sins.To me, that means that as a Christian, I recognize all the sins as they are outlined I. The bible, and I try my best to forgive and accept everyone regardless of their sin."
csjkq8f,Jfreak7,"Not really, but sort of I guess? If God told you to do something, you would follow it, right? Even blindly. Rightfully so, I believe. God created these definitions, so we should follow suit and follow them.My initial question was that I didn't understand the comment about defining homosexuality as a sin but then making the comment ""It's not my definition, it's God's definition"". To me it implied that you held a different definition than the one you follow, which seemed...weird. I don't think that's the case.I'm not sure I agree that sin is part of our definition. There is no doubt that we need Jesus, but when we were created, we weren't sinful. Anyway, I guess that's a completely different discussion. >""To me, that means that as a Christian, I recognize all the sins as they are outlined I.

csjutto,za3keaxi,The problem is that all religious thoughts and beliefs are harmful.
csjxkje,jburn09,"Love Thy Neighbor is a harmful thought? I will echo foulrot here. Those that use religion as an excuse to control/harm others should be condemned. However, lumping every religious belief/thought as harmful or treating the religious people for simply associating with them as bad human beings makes you no better than the people who condemn someone for their sexual orientation"
csjyfyr,za3keaxi,"Religious belief is the belief in the reality of the mythological, supernatural, or spiritual aspects of a religion. ""Love they neighbor"" is not a religious belief. A religious belief is that ""I should only treat other people well because God told me to"", because it could lead to similarly-insane logic being applied to an unethical position (e.g. ""I hate gay people and/or their actions because God told me to"").To be clear, all religious beliefs are evil. This sounds blunt, but [I am not alone or extreme in believing this is the case.](http://www.amazon.com/God-Is-Not-Great-Everything/dp/0446697966)"
csk301y,jburn09,"Love thy neighbor is very much a religious belief/teaching/thought. You said nothing that proves otherwise. The $8 book you linked from Amazon does not make your statements anything other the broad generalizations that you are unjustly applying to many good people. I am not a religious man, but I follow a simple rule: don't be shitty to others. Your treatment and attitude towards people of faith is incredibly hypocritical. I wish you the best of luck on your journey; it won't be any easier if you assume an entire group of people are horrible without merit"
csk37vd,za3keaxi,"Love thy neighbor is an obvious ethical viewpoint that stems from an innate sense of fair play that not predates the Bible, but is also displayed in animals, and most importantly it does not fit the definition of a religious belief. It simply has no spiritual or supernatural component (unlike a belief in Heaven or reincarnation, for example).Who said people are horrible? I said all religious beliefs are poisonous and dangerous. I cited a book of evidence. I am still awaiting any refutation -- your character assassination doesn't count as one. If I was an abolitionist in 1860 stating that all slavery is bad, you wouldn't accuse me of treating plantation owners badly and having a bad attitude toward them. You would realize that I simply have a correct opinion that is impossible to state in a way that wouldn't offend a slave owner. There's no point in mincing words."

Those are simply good practices that a religion has suggested its followers live by (i.e. religious practices). There are plenty of good life tips that are passed down as part of a religion (e.g. meditation, mindfulness, etc.). But all of those can be followed with zero religious influence. To the extent that they are advised to be followed because a past holy person or deity advised it... well, that becomes a dangerous path. But a practice that is based on ethics or science (not deities or spirituality) is not inherently religious."
csk00px,,[deleted]
csk2fyl,za3keaxi,"> explain how the Buddhist belief of rebirth is evil or harmful. Because it's not based on facts or evidence. It cannot be measured or tested with any sort of rational process. The Flying Spaghetti Monster is just as provable/believable as the Buddhist belief of rebirth. And once you start accepting random spiritual beliefs without any standard for assessing them, then you are teaching yourself and others around you that it's okay to just believe random stuff with no standard whatsoever -- including made-up sets of morals and ethics based on what a person ""believes is right for them and the world"". This is dangerous. And you see it with many religious people who all make up their own whack-ass interpretation of their religion based on what's convenient for their world-view. And guess what? No one can refute it, because it's no more or less (measurably) valid than something made-up out of thin air or written in some ancient text like ""rebirth"".Is it good that Buddhism embraces scientific knowledge? Of course. But I don't need to be Buddhist to recognize that obvious value in scientific knowledge. Again, that's not a religious belief -- and surprise, it's a good practice to follow. The point is that you can tease all of the useful practices out of a religion, leave all of the *actual* religious/spiritual content at the curb, and you'd be better off 100% of the time.I believe that hateful beliefs poison society. They influence how people vote and they influences what rights people are granted (e.g. gay marriage has been banned by tens of states in the last decade out of fear from these alleged ""Christians who just have their private beliefs and aren't hurting anyone""). Clearly, that logic doesn't hold up. It's no different from racism or sexism -- the defense that ""people just want to sit in their homes and private believe black people are inferior. That's ok! We should accept that. They aren't hurting anyone!"" is, in practice, total BS.The existence or spread of any religious belief begets the dangerous practice of believing other improvable, fallacious arguments and those beliefs do influence behaviors and encourage the spread of other religious beliefs. Therefore, they are all inherently dangerous, just like belief *any* form of pseudoscience. It is a scourge upon society and adds no value whatsoever. All of the good things that you could identify or list (like churches running after-school basketball programs for troubled youths) would be entirely good and fine (and better) without any church (or religious dogma) associated with it."
csjpbvt,cough_cough_harrumph,"But the act of marriage between a gay couple is a sin per the Bible, correct? I mean, I know we allow marriage between adulterers and liars, etc. to happen every day, but that act of marriage in those cases are not sins in and of themselves - the act of gay marriage is. If all sins are equal, saying you are OK with gay marriage and you should not be against it is equivalent to saying you should not try to stop your married friend from committing adultery, and instead just love and accept him the way he is (at least from a Christan perspective). Granted, not saying we as Christians should not love everyone, but I am just interested in understanding your viewpoint with what you said."
csjybm8,,[deleted]
csk4c9u,cough_cough_harrumph,"As /u/black_fire said, I kind of assumed by saying the act of sex was wrong, then by extension the marriage was a sin, too. I mean, if I recall correctly the Bible states the physical union from sex being a key part of marriage and all that, so I do not think it is saying gay couples being married is fine like some loophole. But I am no Biblical scholar so maybe I am wrong."
csk2uld,black_fire,"I think this is a bit pedantic here (no offense) because the Bible makes strong connections between marriage and sex, so a gay marriage could be considered an...implicit sin? I'm not sure how to define it, but I think you understand my point"
csjg2bs,Kaique94,Now that I can I'm getting married in november and you're all invited.
csjfp2f,,"Exactly this. When I got married, as a straight couple, I have the option to include God or exclude, as is our right, and we chose to have a non-denominational ceremony. We are still recognized legally, religion has nothing to do with anything regarding our marriage being recognized by the State. The argument against gay marriage was always based on religious grounds and ideally, our country cannot make laws that favor one religion, or any religion, because it violates our constitution. They tried to go around this but the argument was weak. I'm so glad the SCOTUS ruled for equality because legally, it makes no sense to deny gay couples a right that we straight couples have. This isn't about the Church. This is about being legally recognized, getting the same legal protections and privledges that straight couples get. Religion with marriage is an afterthought. Since I can get married without God, it should be common sense that gay couples can get married, whether God is included in that ceremony has nothing to do with the legality of that marriage."
csji32g,greenearrow,"The problem is the ""ordinary people"" part of your statement. I agree with you, LGBTQ individuals are ordinary people who deserve all the rights and happiness of straight people. Not terribly long ago, sodomy laws were still on the books, and Scalia argued that ""ordinary people"" had a right to not employ, house, or serve LGBTQ individuals. i.e., a sitting justice does, or at least recently did, not consider those individuals to be ""ordinary people"". Once that ridiculous law was struck down, now they had to find ways to treat these ordinary people differently, and started to make the argument about the ""traditional definition"" of marriage. This of course was bullshit, because the ""traditional definition"" of marriage was that the control of a woman was passed from her father to her husband, and until last century, those women subsequently lost all rights to their property and had no voice in society."

To thecontrary, it is the enduring importance of marriage thatunderlies the petitioners' contentions. This, they say, istheir whole point. Far from seeking to devalue marriage,the petitioners seek it for themselves because of theirrespect—and need—for its privileges and responsibilities.And their immutable nature dictates that same-sex marriageis their only real path to this profound commitment.> Recounting the circumstances of three of these casesillustrates the urgency of the petitioners' cause from theirperspective.

In 2011, however, Arthur wasdiagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS.This debilitating disease is progressive, with no knowncure. Two years ago, Obergefell and Arthur decided tocommit to one another, resolving to marry before Arthurdied. To fulfill their mutual promise, they traveled from Ohio to Maryland, where same-sex marriage was legal. Itwas difficult for Arthur to move, and so the couple werewed inside a medical transport plane as it remained on thetarmac in Baltimore. Three months later, Arthur died.Ohio law does not permit Obergefell to be listed as thesurviving spouse on Arthur's death certificate. By statute,they must remain strangers even in death, a stateimposedseparation Obergefell deems “hurtful for the restof time.” App. in No. 14–556 etc., p. 38. He brought suitto be shown as the surviving spouse on Arthur's deathcertificate.> April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse are co-plaintiffs in thecase from Michigan. They celebrated a commitment ceremonyto honor their permanent relation in 2007. Theyboth work as nurses, DeBoer in a neonatal unit and Rowsein an emergency unit. In 2009, DeBoer and Rowse fosteredand then adopted a baby boy. Later that same year,they welcomed another son into their family. The newbaby, born prematurely and abandoned by his biologicalmother, required around-the-clock care. The next year, ababy girl with special needs joined their family. Michigan,however, permits only opposite-sex married couples orsingle individuals to adopt, so each child can have only onewoman as his or her legal parent. If an emergency were toarise, schools and hospitals may treat the three childrenas if they had only one parent. And, were tragedy to befalleither DeBoer or Rowse, the other would have no legalrights over the children she had not been permitted toadopt. This couple seeks relief from the continuing uncertaintytheir unmarried status creates in their lives.> Army Reserve Sergeant First Class Ijpe DeKoe and hispartner Thomas Kostura, co-plaintiffs in the Tennesseecase, fell in love. In 2011, DeKoe received orders to deployto Afghanistan. Before leaving, he and Kostura marriedin New York. A week later, DeKoe began his deployment,which lasted for almost a year. When he returned, the two settled in Tennessee, where DeKoe works full-time for theArmy Reserve. Their lawful marriage is stripped fromthem whenever they reside in Tennessee, returning anddisappearing as they travel across state lines. DeKoe, whoserved this Nation to preserve the freedom the Constitutionprotects, must endure a substantial burden.The cases now before the Court involve other petitionersas well, each with their own experiences. Their storiesreveal that they seek not to denigrate marriage but ratherto live their lives, or honor their spouses' memory, joinedby its bond."

Marriage is at once a deeply personal commitment to another human being and a highly public celebration of the ideals of mutuality, companionship, intimacy, fidelity, and family. Because it fulfils yearnings for security, safe haven, and connection that express our common humanity, ... marriage is an esteemed institution, and the decision whether and whom to marry is among life's momentous acts of self-definition.""(This was a reading my wife and I used at our wedding.)"

csjoad6,Medic-chan,"S.O? Come on dude, on this landmark day go ahead and specify WIFE!"
csjlyxo,misspeelled,"Thank you kindly, I really appreciate all the kind words here today! You guys rock and I love this state, even if sometimes I don't love what some people in it do."
csjnfhh,Card182,Other fellow Texan here. I'm disappointed in our city's response. I had a big bowl of popcorn and pitcher of ice cold kool-aid ready to watch the apocalypse happening. Instead here I am watching soap operas cause I can't find the remote.
csjqoyr,misspeelled,"Where are you at? Harris county's clerk is being a gigantic dillhole about all of it and they are making people wait for some mythical ""updated form"". Never mind that Austin and Dallas they're just scribbling out bride/groom and writing it in."
csjr712,Card182,I'm in Collin where apparently they're speaking with county attorneys before acting. Although it seems like in the Denton and the Colony counties they're just refusing people.
csjrniy,arcticphoenix81,I'm in Collin County too. I want to take my marriage certificate from Canada down to the courthouse and shove it in their faces.
csjskcu,misspeelled,"That's what they did here, but I guess the latest is that they're issuing starting at 3pm today. That sucks about Collin County though. I guess if people were desperate they could head down to Dallas, but they shouldn't have to. I knew that some counties/government offices would drag their feet, but I was hoping I was wrong."
csju0v7,gamer_6,"Unfortunately, homophobia isn't an ideology. Certain ideologies *support* certain biases, they don't create them."
csjj20z,tylerdurden801,"Odd choice for your new name, but who am I to judge. Congrats, Suck It."
csjk0i2,,*Holds glass to the sky*Here's to the Suck Its!
csjjzoo,Neoncow,That's Mrs. Suck it.
csjluk7,misspeelled,Now I have to wonder if they'd let me change it to that...
csjoviu,chickenmagic,"Last name Texas, first name Suck. Middle name It."
csji1vc,McPantaloons,How'd you come to a decision on name taking? Did your wife just have a cooler last name?
csjlt22,misspeelled,"When I was 19 I got married to a guy and took his last name, which suited me fine because my maiden name is *awful*. Anyway, once I figured myself out and came out a couple of years later, we got a divorce (as you do). I just kept his last name, honestly, because it was easier and I hated my maiden one so badly. So I'm eager to get rid of the one I have and take hers. Plus as soon as I mentioned it as a possibility, she freaked out in excitement - so the choice was easy! We did think about coming up with our own new one, but in the end we decided me taking hers was the right move for us :) Thanks for asking though!"
csjnxhu,McPantaloons,"Cool, thanks for sharing and congratulations! I never really thought about name taking in same sex marriages. It would be interesting to see statistics on how often it happens."
csjqnjd,misspeelled,"It's different for everyone and not anything anyone really prepared me for growing up, you know?"
csjqusz,McPantaloons,"Yeah it's different for everyone, but I just think it would be interesting to see stats on how many people choose to take someone else's name without the pressure of tradition that's in hetero marriage."
csjj2eu,BirdFloozy,maybe they're switching last names! :)
csjj4bz,2boredtocare,"And technically, anyone can change their name to whatever they want at any time. :)"
csjk52x,qwicksilfer,Princess Consuela Banana-Hammock
csjmof3,SmolderingDesigns,"Crap Bag. First name: Crap, last name: Bag."
csjmt91,qwicksilfer,That's a great name! I love Crap!
csjj0on,ArandomKodama,yay! congratulations.
csjjm7f,cleaver_username,"I'm so excited for you! Not only are you married, but now EVERYONE has to recognize it :)"
csjk0wm,KeptSayingTryAnother,Congratulations. I'm very happy for you. I'm a Californian. Stay. We love you!
csjlxrk,misspeelled,"I left California to be with the wife! But trust me, we're coming back some day."
csjmliw,BeatsWheats,"This issue was, to me, one of the few things wrong in Texas. Now Texas is even closer to being as awesome as it can be!"
csjq87t,rchalico,"Congrats, I really feel SO happy for people like you who have been having a hard time for years."
csjqjpk,misspeelled,"I'm not quite 40 yet and let me tell you, I never imagined I'd see this day in my life. Thanks for the warm fuzzies!"
csjje1f,Bacon_Bitz,Whoa whoa whoa no need to be so harsh to Texas; there are many natives that support you. Now we are 10x freer than the other 49!
csjlwk6,misspeelled,"I love Texas, not to worry. And I love Texans, even if some of them...don't love me so much."
csjj32i,idevxy,"California here. Glad we could help, and welcome to the party. =)"
csjlvn6,misspeelled,"I'm a native Californian, so it was like coming home. Nice party you got there though!"
csjnglg,idevxy,"Yeah, it's pretty rockin'. Too bad nobody brought water. =/"
csjlwer,nacho-bitch,hugs and congratulations.
csjp2ph,paddledog,"Happy for you, this is LONG time in coming!!!"
csjpi76,,">Time to go get my name changed, suck it Texas.Oh, so you still want to adopt the oppressive traditions of patriarchy?j/k"
csjpunj,Schokoladekuchen,Make sure you spell it right!! Hhahaha! No but really congrats!
csjq7zi,jeffpewpewdash,Congratulations! It was a decision long overdue.
csjqcgn,kisschicken,"I read you started cycling to work and I was thinking, ""Good on ya, mate."""
csjqiol,misspeelled,"Oh man I totally would too, but unfortunately my city is a death trap for cyclists."
csjrw36,k3nd0,"As a fellow Texan, I'm very happy for you. Make sure you get all of your IDs in order so that you're not [disenfranchised](http://www.npr.org/2013/10/30/241891800/texas-voter-id-law-creates-a-problem-for-some-women) come next election."
csjsl2u,Indie__Guy,Im so happy for you gals.
csjtgke,,"Fuck yeah, congratulations!"
csjw9hv,JaviAir,Another fellow Texan... CONGRATULATIONS!
csjwu9p,HPRedditAccount,Just a heads up; Texas has no LGBT employment protection. So your work can fire you for being gay.
csjwwne,misspeelled,"Definitely appreciate the heads-up! It's okay though, I only work here 3 more weeks before I head back to school :)"
csjv2gi,koke84,"Austinite here, that's awesome just remember not all of Texas is lame"
csjv6mh,xenthum,"> Time to go get my name changedKeep that documentation forever. If you ever move or apply for fucking anything they want that original document of name change. Keep old IDs, credit cards, etc also, and contact everyone you need to promptly to have them changed.Name changes are such legal bullshit but if you want to enjoy that tradition, I encourage you to be diligent with your paperwork. It *will* be a problem in your future."
csjx0st,,Reading this just made me start tearing up at work as well. I am so happy for you two!!! I can't believe this took so long...
csjz5zg,ryanisawesomish,I'd upvote you but you're at 1776 karma... congrats though!
csk04rg,lettucent,I'm straight and I'm crying. I love happiness and this was a huge net gain in it.
csk3yfu,Slammybutt,"As a Texan, this makes me happy. Congrats"
csk4x2q,InvincibleSummer1066,I am so happy for you. Congratulations. So sincerely.
csjj1iv,ilikeuasafriend,Make sure you don't misspeell it
csjjhlt,Tesabella,"Texas needs to suck a lot of things, but at least they get this one first."
csjjm0y,VikingCoder,"I was scanning the dissenting opinions, and I haven't seen them address this point at all...?Can anyone quote them on this part?"
csjtyjl,gamer_6,The very notion that certain couples require 'protection' is sickening.Just be aware that the law doesn't change the way some people feel and you will still be hated by them no matter what.
csjwamx,Babyd0llx420,wait? wife? are you a guy?

csjll0v,octopoddle,"This is an excellent question, actually. WHERE?"
csjyem4,FMJ48,Don't fall for it. This guy is a sys admin. He creates bash scripts and executes them on gay people.

csjeqyv,BlueTeamTV,"I'm going to stay away from Facebook today.... Edit: imma answer some questions because of all these comments I'm gettin here. 1. No I'm not a bigot just because I have some ignorant friends and older family friends. 2. My time line has been very positive! Although, there are some young kids preaching how this law is illegal, anti God, etc. 3. This post was meant to be kinda of a joke anyways. Yes, there will be some ignorant folks on my Facebook time line, but the majority have been praising this decision"
csjflh7,CrazyAsian,"I used to live in a city that was mostly conservative before I moved to a liberal campus (and then liberal city for my job). By now, most of my conservative ""friends"" have defriended me for being too pro-LGBT. WELL FUCK THEM. TODAY IS A GOOD DAY. MY ENTIRE FACEBOOK WALL IS RAINBOWS AND I FUCKING LOVE IT."

csjiix7,mormotomyia,life is fabulous
csjpm2j,curiousbydesign,I am actually hoping this happens to me as well. I do not want negative people in my life. Such an easy filter to apply. I want more positive. Bring on the rainbows!
csjuwub,bigtuck54,I got unfollowed by 10 people on Twitter today lmao
csjjq3h,chron67,I live in Mississippi. I have a good many friends scattered around the US though. My facebook newsfeed is this weird mix of joy/love/hate/dismay. Between the people saying the civil war had nothing to do with slavery and now the people saying our country deserves to burn I think I will be avoiding Facespace a while...
csjh6qt,yuube,"Just come out of the closet, we all know about your ""friends""."

csjsypn,Sdubya78,"I'm a conservative-leaning libertarian and I think the decision was a good one. Whether you are gay yourself or you feel that homosexuality is an abomination, the words ""All men are created equal"" are set in stone and cannot be ignored.There are other things to argue and consider here, but one thing is very clear. As long as the government is allowed to issue licenses to people for something they call ""marriage,"" gay people are people too and have every right to that license.It doesn't get any more clear."
csjiuzo,Mega_Khajit,I can see the second paragraph of your comment being a part of John Oliver's script
csjfnx3,SUSAN_IS_A_BITCH,Mine is nothing but rainbows and love right now. Are your friends that batshit that your Facebook has turned into a hate parade?
csjfpav,BlueTeamTV,I grew up in a religious household. Lots of older family friends on Facebook. It'll be fun to see what they say
csjg9qz,Phaelin,"Deep South here, my friends are great but their beliefs make them batshit crazy when stuff like this happens. Facebook is going to be strange today.Update: None of the ones that would be angry about it have said anything so far, probably out mourning the loss of their country. Love and support from everyone else."
csjgzyh,manslayer22,Same. Friend already said they are going to church to save their souls from immoral America. He is also someone who in his apartment has a sign that said God's last name isn't Damn It and gets mad at people for saying God Damn It.
csjjii1,ilessthan3math,I *only* use the word 'god' if it's followed by 'damnit'.
csjksif,manslayer22,Or while getting a blowjob or sex.
csjh6bj,Phaelin,"Yeah, mine have been going on and on for the past week about how great the Confederate flag is and how no one is taking away their freedom. Of course, banning the flag is a totally different beast than legalizing gay marriage, but it's all the same level of evil to them."
csjiv6j,Langston_huge,Deep south here. I saw one slightly negative comment. Otherwise it is all rainbows and love or nothing.
csjj51k,Phaelin,"That's awesome, you have good friends 😀"
csjgn57,FugaFeels,Same and live in the Bible belt...my FB is all over the spectrum. I'm putting on my rainbow cape and jumping straight in there though!
csjmatu,waspocracy,Ditto. I either unfriend or unfollow the ignorant.
csjgh4u,superslothwaffle,There are always the 2 or 3 that post a lot and clog up the love
csjghg0,calfan5,"Maybe he just wants to see updates about friends' lives, not 100 of the same basic news articles with rainbow pictures with the caption ""finally!"".

csjh4nk,yuube,"You're only supposed to downvote on reddit if it doesn't relate to the discussion, not because you disagree."
csjg5ew,treyson,I like spending time on Facebook on days like today. I'm usually able to unfriend a few assholes
csjgaqr,BlueTeamTV,We should have a mega post with all the over dramatic comments and posts.
csjg3jt,kinkyslinky,I'm from West Texas. Yes it will be a cesspool all week.

csjhu4g,ClassyJacket,"If anyone on my Facebook thinks this is a bad thing I'll just instantly delete them.I've only had to delete one person over stuff like this, and strangely enough he was gay. A sad, confused gay man, filled with hate for everyone, including himself."
csjghc3,jedispyder,I only have to worry about 4 people making shitting comments about it. I already hid 2 of the 4 because I was tired of them only posting shitty religious items. The rest of my friends are overtly excited over the ruling.

George Takei is flipping his shit (in a good way). My pastor is SUPER excited because she's been fighting for this for a long time.Maybe my family isn't up yet to see this (west coast). I may be in for some stupid posts I have to resist responding to later on."
csjic9s,nintynineninjas,That's the one place I'm headed. Can't wait to see the sea of salty tears.
csjignz,BigDiggerNick74,"Live in the south. I should do the same, but the irony coming from unwed single mothers I know posting about how this goes against the bible is too good. Edit: not saying single mothers are bad, but you can't attack gay marriage as a sin and act like the Bible doesn't say anything about fornication."
csjijoc,maytagem,Most of my friends are from South Carolina and things are incredibly positive on there

csjls67,violbabe,I have too much family on Facebook that is probably anti everything I can think of but eh who cares. I'm spreading the love and support to the people that deserved to have in their lives for such a long time- but it's finally happened so now I can just silently celebrate. I'm so ecstatic for them and hope everyone has happy marriages!!
csjmk47,fruit_flyy,"Are you me? No but seriously, I made the mistake of checking Facebook before reddit. Saw everything you've been describing. It made me a bit sad despite the overwhelming positivity I'd been seeing. But now reddit has reversed the effect C:"

csji4jj,Mochigood,"I have a cuckoo uncle who, during one Christmas dinner, warned me and my cousins that if we weren't wary and careful, when gay marriage passed, we would all be forced to have a ""homosexual experience"". One of my cousins laughed, thinking it was a joke. He hasn't talked to her since. The funny thing is, the son of that uncle insists that he's closeted."
csjipe5,TheCSquad,I guess he wasn't wary and careful...
csjlevf,wormspeaker,"It's not that it's funny, it actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it. These people who are very vocally anti-gay talk like it's just one slip up and everyone will be forced to be gay. They talk like this because they have deep feelings of attraction to the same sex, but have been told it is wrong for their whole life. So they need to be on guard to protect themselves from this gay feeling which is what they think the gays want to exploit. Since they are themselves gay or bisexual they don't understand that straight people don't actually feel sexual attraction to the same sex.So all this guilt and confusing feelings that they don't understand are not present in most people leads to this."
csjlsff,,I never thought of it like this! I always wondered just how some people could be so scared. This sums it up entirely. Wow.

csjspny,Bowbreaker,They can and normally do. Just as a straight man who is into both white and black women doesn't need both to be happy.
csjss3o,growlingbear,"Ok, so it's an attraction, not obsession."
csjtpxr,Bowbreaker,Yes. Just like heterosexuality pretty much. Except for the limitation to only ~50% of the population.
csjmox3,beevaubee,"This.Given that there are supposed to be more bisexuals (Kinsey scale 1s to 5s) than homosexuals (Kinsey scale 6s), that makes sense. These people's thoughts go basically: 'That same-sex person over there is really fuckable' - (in case of religiosity) 'OMG that must be God testing me if I can withstand the temptation!'/(in case of general 'anything gay is icky'ness) 'WTF I better not fall for the inherent evil temptation that these bad gays have!' ... 'Yay! Wasn't so hard, was it?' (while not admitting to themselves that these feelings of attraction aren't really gone/need to be suppressed by booze or other vices) ... 'Again these evil gays who are just out to tempt everyone, like this seriously cute/handsome/beautiful other same-sex person who I can't help ogling...' Repeat ad nauseum with faulty logic. -.-"
csjn9yv,wormspeaker,It might be made worse when straight guys like me make jokes about sucking dick for $20 or how we're totally straight but would go gay for [insert name of manly actor].
csjny2r,beevaubee,"Huh, right. I hadn't thought of that as a straight woman myself. Women generally don't say these things, at least not amongst my (more or less straight) female acquaintances. But yeah, to these people this might be just more proof that same-sex attraction is ""inevitable"" and that you could be strong enough to actually joke about it and still be righteously hetero."

csjmhgy,Mochigood,"It's not laughably funny, and if true, sad, even though he loves his wife and children dearly and probably wouldn't trade them for the world. I just meant funny, as in strangely or curiously, or maybe even ironically."

csjoy9s,wormspeaker,But if you do that then you will be sentenced to hell fire where Satan will fuck you in the ass for the rest of eternity. Whoa... now that I say it that way.... BRB going to find a dick to suck.
csjpf2j,cold_iron_76,"Classic repression and projection. Although, I wouldn't necessarily say they all have homosexual attraction buried, the gays are also a good projection point for repressed straight desires. Prostitutes are another easy projection point which is why these do gooders often rail on that too."
csk4uqd,Ssutuanjoe,"> Classic repression and projection.Repression and *reaction formation*. Projection is attritbuting ones feelings onto others (e.g. me accusing you of craving pizza when, in fact, I'm the one who's craving pizza). Hehe but it's really only important to know the difference if you care about the semantics of it ;)"
csk9fhd,cold_iron_76,"> reaction formationI tend to think of reaction formation to repressed homosexuality as typically resulting in expression of the opposite ""effeminate"" traits typically assigned to homosexuals resulting in attempts at hyper-masculinity. Criticism of gays would certainly be a part, but a true reaction formation should result in over expression of the opposite traits of that thing they are repressing. I tend to think more of Projection in a lot of the anti-gay stuff because the visceral nastiness is so directed outright that there doesn't seem to be as much obvious RF. It's more like their inner feelings begin to bubble up, so they redirect to fighting it to refocus attention away from them and onto others. But, you're right in that it could be an RF. Many of the Defense Mechanisms are so similar to each other and even overlapping in so many ways that it is hard to discern at times just what is making that person's outward expression manifest."

csjumrs,wormspeaker,"Yes, I'd say the most vocal and outspoken ones are. If you want some proof then just google ""Republican Senator/Representative Gay Scandal"" or ""Christian Pastor Gay Scandal"" and you will find many vocally anti-gay Senators, Representatives, and Pastors have actually been outed as gay or at least engaging in gay sex.

csjefnf,Wrong_on_Internet,"Full opinion:http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf**Highlights from the Majority**> * The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution's central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed> * Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here. But when that sincere, personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied. > * No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.**Highlights from the Roberts Dissent**> * When decisions are reached through democratic means, some people will inevitably be disappointed with the results. But those whose views do not prevail at least know that they have had their say, and accordingly are—in the tradition of our political culture—reconciled to the result of a fair and honest debate. ... But today the Court puts a stop to all that. By deciding this question under the Constitution, the Court removes it from the realm of democratic decision. There will be consequences to shutting down the political process on an issue of such profound public significance. Closing debate tends to close minds. People denied a voice are less likely to accept the ruling of a court on an issue that does not seem to be the sort of thing courts usually decide.> * If you are among the many Americans—of whatever sexual orientation—who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today's decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it.**Highlights from the Scalia Dissent**> * This is a naked judicial claim to legislative—indeed, super-legislative—power; a claim fundamentally at odds with our system of government.> * But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today's judicial Putsch.> * If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: ""The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,"" I would hide my head in a bag. The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie.**Highlights from the Alito Dissent**> * By imposing its own views on the entire country, the majority facilitates the marginalization of the many Americans who have traditional ideas. Recalling the harsh treatment of gays and lesbians in the past, some may think that turn-about is fair play. But if that sentiment prevails, the Nation will experience bitter and lasting wounds.**Highlights from the Thomas Dissent**> * (LOL, not worth including)"

csjg7xz,GuyForgett,"the funny thing is that every single supreme court decision--and most lower court decisions--always have phrases like that that make you scratch your head and that you have to think about to really understand.

csjgmom,GuyForgett,yeah that's pretty bullshit too. I really wish he could take a step back and realize that being a petulant child in a monumental decision like this makes the court look bad and is bad for the country.
csjgr8t,RememberYoureAWomble,Yeah. I wonder whether he has considered that as future generations read the majority opinion in what will (presumably) be a landmark judgment they will also read his dissent. It may not age that well.

csjgky5,duffmanhb,"Scalia does. It's part of his character. He's the guy that knows he has peaked in life, and can't get fired, so many judges in his position stop caring about being highly formal and professional. Scalia especially, since he likes to mess around in his dissents."

csk7a24,hiS_oWn,"This is completely in character. When he's on the winning side he's almost a savant, whenever he's on the losing side he's a petulant man child."
csjusvv,NameSmurfHere,"He's frustrated and beyond himself. The definition of certain aspects of the constitution has been stretched a ton, arguably overly so.Even agreeing with the end result I personally abhor the method it was accomplished- both the stretching of an outdated document not amended enough and the historic end result of it being a 5-4 SCOTUS decision(which can in turn be remade by a less humanist SCOTUS) rather than constitutional amendment.Can you really not imagine a time 100yrs from now where in another conservative spike this decision cannot be overruled and titled a 'folly of a time which allowed China to overtake USA?' Enshrining this right in the constitution would protect our minorities and make their safety inseparable from the fabric of the great nation."
csjx592,neoweasel,"This one? Not likely. Anti-gay sentiment shows up more often among the older segments of the USAs population. They're not being replaced.

Many(in terms of number, not percentage) Scandanavian youth are in fact flat out racist xenophobes because of certain social and governmental issues. Of course, you won't see much of that sentiment openly on a place like Reddit but it still exists and is visible if you ever happen upon the right r/WorldNews threads. That is just an example. Hope this clarifies why I don't trust something so important to a 5-4 decision that may be revisited under a more clouded lens."
csjgpm8,_manoftheyear_,"In his defense style is crucial in SCOTUS decisions. Pretty much every case the court hears is based around a few words in a law or another courts decision. Look at the healthcare ruling we just got, that whole case basically centered around 5 words in a 900 page law."

csjn0yw,Durbee,On the nose. He even makes fun of the writing style of Kennedy - the guy is having a wall-eyed fit.
csjhazl,1mikeg,He also has to be careful not to put it to official record that he directly opposed a decision that simply granted more freedoms to the citizens of a freedom loving country. Thus he attacks the decision as an abuse of power rather than an idea he opposes.

We just had the SCOTUS do what the legislative should've, and that is never something that should be done- the SCOTUS(once all are appointed) has fewer checks in practice than politicians do, and it overstepping bounds is scary.Is the end result good? Hell yeah. Is there legitimate disconcertion that this was done by SCOTUS? Yes."
csk2vo1,Sir__Hippo,Yet we keep having to revisit this in the same class of societal issues. When the legislative arm stops making laws which restrict and outlaw the rights of Americans I'll stop supporting the SCOTUS when they strike those laws down.

csjnanl,RellenD,They just recognized the previously recognized right to marry.
cska4bz,mrcosmicna,"Yes, this is an extremely common strand of conservative judicial reasoning about judicial activism. Scalia's concerned with the usurpation of congress as democratic representatives, and the fidelity of the Constitution as an entrenched, rigid document with special amendment procedures. The idea that unelected judges can make significant changes to the law, and imply substantive ""rights"" (ie, the ""right to marry""), as an entrenched constitutional right, is antithetical to this conservative and originalist approach to constitutional interpretation."
csjfd1z,Wrong_on_Internet,"No. Scalia has an unusually intemperate, acerbic style."
csjk63d,parlor_tricks,"YeahWhat is constitutional imperative? Define ? How does an ""const. Imp."" - define- anything?

Is it a crayon? A lamp? Does it draw lines or throw a shadow/light which can help me you define ""An urgent liberty"".Ok I give up. Never mind.And all of this stuff gives birth to a right?I mean, I don't get how this works.

csjt242,volcanopele,"If there is one thing I've learned during all my interactions with politicians, reaching the highest echelons of power in this country doesn't magically grant you mental maturity."

csjiyoo,TrappedInThePantry,"Just Scalia. He's a child, and his audience is conservative law students who can read his dissents and jerk off over how cool and dismissive he is."
csjnaf8,,"Yes. Many of his opinions and his dissents in particular are filled with as much hyperbole and politicking as legal reasoning, which is not to say he doesn't have a great legal mind.

csjjlmw,,"Yeah, he's essentially saying the ruling isn't 'mature', but (again) comes off like he's having a hissy fit. Had to google Putsch and it's ""a secretly plotted and suddenly executed attempt to overthrow a government"" according to Merriam-Webster... maybe Scalia is running for something."
csjkz35,Capnboob,"He used the word ""putsch?""When I hear that word I think of Hitler's failed Beer Hall Putsch in the 20s. There has to be a different word Scalia could have used. Or is he really trying to make people think about the Nazis?"

csjghga,,"Well, my opinion on gay marriage is that it should be legal, but I disagree with *this* result because the court is just interpreting the Constitution incorrectly.As to [Citizens United v.

Not necessarily. But if you want a different national law, you should change the law, not legislate from the bench."
csjhbi2,midnight_thunder,"People have been lamenting judicial activism for decades. If you don't believe marriage to be a substantive right under the 14th amendment, which also protects same-sex marriages, do you believe there to be a substantive right to an abortion? Or contraceptives? If so, why not marriage? You see legislating from the bench, I see the enumeration of a substantive right."
csjhfpw,,"> If you don't believe marriage to be a substantive right under the 14th amendment, which also protects same-sex marriages, do you believe there to be a substantive right to an abortion? Or contraceptives? If so, why not marriage? Certainly not; abortion and contraceptives are not addressed in the Constitution, so you would need Constitutional amendments if you wanted to address these issues. Otherwise it's left to the states.I'm curious as to why I'm getting downvoted for this. I'm not trying to be rude, and I don't think I'm expressing a controversial opinion."
csjhu8l,midnight_thunder,"So according to you, states should be free to ban contraceptives, abortion, mixed race marriage (Loving v. Virginia), same sex marriages, or the right to attend a private school?Do not be naive. Sometimes the Court is the only feasible protector of the rights of the oppressed. This principle has been recognized as far back as the Federalist Papers."
csjia2r,,"> So according to you, states should be free to ban contraceptives, abortion, mixed race marriage (Loving v. Virginia), same sex marriages, or the right to attend a private school?* Contraceptives: yes, states should have that ability constitutionally, though I'd support an amendment reversing this. People don't realize how much power is granted to the states. We're essentially supposed to be a somewhat loose association of different states.* Abortion: yes, Roe v. Wade was an absurd reading of the constitution.* Mixed race marriage: no, I believe the 14th Amendment is relevant in this case and the court got it right, morally and legally. ""The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination.""* The right to attend a private school: I have no idea, I'm not aware of this one. Is there some case I don't know about?"
csjik0c,midnight_thunder,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierce_v._Society_of_Sisters
csjr52t,midnight_thunder,"Your acceptance of *Loving*, makes no logical sense. Justice Kennedy puts it perfectly: (important bit at the end of the first paragraph)""Objecting that this does not reflect an appropriate fram- ing of the issue, the respondents refer to Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997), which called for a “ ‘careful description' ” of fundamental rights. They assert the petitioners do not seek to exercise the right to marry but rather a new and nonexistent “right to same-sex mar- riage.” Brief for Respondent in No. 14–556, p. 8. Glucks- berg did insist that liberty under the Due Process Clause must be defined in a most circumscribed manner, with central reference to specific historical practices. Yet while that approach may have been appropriate for the asserted right there involved (physician-assisted suicide), it is inconsistent with the approach this Court has used in discussing other fundamental rights, including marriage and intimacy. Loving did not ask about a “right to inter- racial marriage”; Turner did not ask about a “right of inmates to marry”; and Zablocki did not ask about a “right of fathers with unpaid child support duties to marry.” Rather, each case inquired about the right to marry in its comprehensive sense, asking if there was a sufficient justification for excluding the relevant class from the right. See also Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 752–773 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 789–792 (BREYER, J., concurring in judgments).That principle applies here. If rights were defined by who exercised them in the past, then received practices could serve as their own continued justification and new groups could not invoke rights once denied. This Court has rejected that approach, both with respect to the right to marry and the rights of gays and lesbians. See Loving 388 U. S., at 12; Lawrence, 539 U. S., at 566–567.""TL;DR: I don't have a right to marry someone of a different race. I don't have a right to marry someone of the same sex. I have a right to marry whoever I want. Period. And there is no justification for preventing me from marrying someone of a different race or sex, if this is what I want."
csjreeg,,"""Equal protection under the law"" means interracial couples should have protected marriage rights, sure.In this case, a new right is required, because technically homosexuals already did have the rights to heterosexual marriage.If you want national gay marriage, it should (but obviously doesn't) require a constitutional amendment."
csjj943,Blain,"If you agree with the Loving ruling then you should have no problem with this current one. In both instances, the Court changed the ""definition"" of marriage in certain states. There's nothing specific about race in the 14th Amendment."
csjjbet,,There's a constitutional basis for the Loving ruling: marrying a member of the opposite sex is a privilege that every adult enjoys. Marrying a member of the same sex is a *new* privilege that has to be invented by law.
csjjjrc,Blain,"Yes and before Loving, people in certain states were saying almost exactly the same things you were: ""marrying a member of the opposite sex and of the same race is a privilege that every adult enjoys."" It's hypocritical to be against one ruling and in favor of the other when they're almost identical.Secondly, there are no new laws that are being enacted as a result of this ruling. This is striking down prohibitive laws in certain states, exactly as Loving did."
csjk12k,,"Pretending they're identical, sure...but that's obviously not the case."
csjke7x,Blain,"In both instances there were prohibitive laws that prevented individuals from marrying. In both instances the Supreme Court struck down those laws and in so doing changed the ""definition of marriage"" in those states. Please elaborate on the ""obvious differences"" though. Legally speaking the two rulings are extremely similar"
csjk9qy,Ardarel,Opponents of Same sex marriage were literally using the same arguments against interracial marriage.
csjpac0,Blain,"It's disappointing that this guy just ignores valid responses to his statements. I would love to talk about this ruling with someone who disagrees with it because of something other than religious reasons, but unfortunately he just stops discussion with people who actually challenge his viewpoints, or just writes vapid statments like ""well that's obviously not the case."""
csjgrv1,n0exit,"That's not how it always works though, and that's why the court is there. Much of the civil rights movement was won in the courts, and you're not going to have many purple saying that it was a bad thing now, but you had the same people calling it ""judicial overreach"" then."
csjhd45,,"I don't actually disagree with a lot of what you're saying. The court interprets the Constitution and rules on cases with that interpretation, it's true. If the court upholds civil rights to all people on a Constitutional basis, those are great victories, both morally and legally.In this case, that's not really happening. In order for the case to be won on a Constitutional basis, you have to do a lot of gymnastics: basically, you have to pretend that the Constitution says marriage is a privilege granted to all adult citizens no matter the sex makeup of the marriage. That's the kind of language you'd need to actually supercede states' rights; basically, you'd need a constitutional amendment (this is why some people on the other side wanted a Constitutional amendment defining marriage as between a man and a woman; they also recognized that the Constitution doesn't define ""traditional"" marriage either. Which, again, is why it was properly left to the states, until today.)There are different approaches, of course. Some judges will say that the Constitution ""implies"" certain rights. The problem is that the Constitution itself says ""if it's not covered here, it's left to the states,"" so to say that the Constitution implies something as radically different from the actual text of the 14th Amendment is to gay marriage, you're basically saying you want things to be a certain way, therefore it's law. That's not how the judicial branch was designed, and honestly it's probably a flaw in the Constitution itself that we essentially grant legislative power to these unelected judges."
csjhz64,Pizza_Nova_Prime_69,"Section 1 of the 14th holds up strongly enough that gay marriage should've been declared legal in 1868, if everyone understood what equal protection under the law is about. If it's enough to say a black family can eat in the same restaurant as a white one, it's enough to say homosexual can marry.It really isn't interpretational gymnastics and it's been a long time coming. Unless a marriage specific amendment were added, there's no reason it *shouldn't* have already been legal under the 14th, that's what the conservatives knew."
csjixpt,,"Not exactly. The privilege of ""marry whichever sex you want"" isn't in there, so you have to have a court willing to invent it at a 5-4 decision for it to become legal. The reason interracial marriages should have always been constitutional is that it doesn't require you to invent something new to rule on it."
csjn776,Pizza_Nova_Prime_69,"There's no new invention, though. It really is interpretation, because otherwise, unless specifically touched on by the constituion, marriage is something that's either legal or not, for everyone. Gay and non-white are only so different, legally."
csjnuwc,,"The new invention is saying ""we now define marriage between individuals of the same sex as a privilege under the constitution,"" essentially. Which is, as the argument continues to go, obviously an insertion rather than an interpretation.In the previous case - interracial marriages - there was no new definition of a privilege. The problem was that the states were making their own definitions of a privilege already held by interracial couples, and that was unconstitutional as per the 14th amendment.Today's ruling, in terms of legal basis, is essentially ""we want gay marriage to be a thing."""
csjpvsa,Bladeof_Grass,"Not really.The 14 Amendment says that everyone should be subject to ""equal protection of the laws"". Now, there's a bunch of laws out there that say when you and another person get together and become ""married"" you get these benefits. You can say you're married, you get tax benefits, health benefits, etc. Now, if this was limited to only two people of opposite gender how does that bring forth the ""equal justice under law"" that has become the de facto interpretation of the 14th Amendment for decades?Any law passed by any level of government must abide by the Constitution of the United States. Traffic laws, drug laws, marriage laws, commerce laws, everything. Just because marriage is not specifically mentioned in the 14th Amendment does not mean that law is exempt from it's application in a constitutional challenge."
csjqybk,,"> The 14 Amendment says that everyone should be subject to ""equal protection of the laws"". Broadening this phrase to include total equality for whichever rights and benefits you want, however, is problematic. What if I'm single and can't get someone to marry me? Shouldn't I have the equal protection under the law? I *want* to get married; why can't I have those benefits? If you used ""equal protection under the law"" the way this court is using it, the vast majority of regulations would be unconstitutional."
csjsbed,Bladeof_Grass,"I think you're misinterpreting what that statement means. This equal protection protects you from discriminatory laws. Discrimination (from a legal standpoint) is treating someone different due to some sort of characteristic that they can't change (sex/gender, race, sexual orientation, etc). Not getting a married tax benefits because you're single isn't discrimination and wouldn't fall under this. Regardless, let's not get into the realm of sensational what ifs."

Now we wait to see if he's right about polygamist marraige too."

csjlkw8,lspetry53,"Serious question, granted it's with fully consenting adults, why are people so opposed to polygamy? Does it have a constitutional basis or is it just out of unfamiliarity/disgust?"
csjs4en,TheZigerionScammer,"There is actually some merit to keeping marriage between two people. Marriage is kind of like making everything about two different people into one person legally. (Not exactly, but you get the idea.) For instance, when one spouse dies, the other spouse gets everything. How are you going to deal with it when a man dies with two surviving widows? What about if one of those wives is also married to another man? Does he get something? Are the children from one woman or man considered to be family (in terms of hospital visits) to the other spouse and his or her kids? What about if a Denobulan marriage web (Star Trek reference) situation pops up where a man is married to multiple women who are each married to multiple men who are married to other women and....well, you get the point.Legalizing gay marriage is as simple as letting a homosexual couple enjoy the rights that a heterosexual couple does. Legalizing polygamous marriages would mean rewriting the entire institution of marriage, either neutering or turning it into a form that we would not recognize anymore."
csk5jvr,spitfu,"You do realize todays decision has exactly the same repercussions in common with poligamy. Our entire legal code, and mountains of bureauracy will now need millions upon millions of changes. Every where it says father, mother, stepfather, stepmother, father in law, mother in law, grandfather, or grandmother, aunt, uncle. That's just the legal profession. Medical, DOD, penal, adoption, housing, education, monetary. Not to mention the legal ramifications for any religious entity that conscientiously objects to performing a gay marriage will face civil and criminal litigation now. Chaplains, Pastors, Priests and Muslim Clerics in the military will now be ostracised and discharged if they can't denounce a major tenant of their faith and perform gay weddings now. I'm completely supportive of gays or what have you being able to marry. Personally I wish any level over government would get it's hands out of marriage. To me marriage is between me, my wife, and God, not the government. The same would go for gay couples. No government interference at all. I fear for the amount of force the lobby with the strong arm of our government will place on religious institutions or folks that think its a sin. Do you now have to fear losing your job, or freedoms, or imprisionment if you don't support this but tolerate it. Will Christians and Catholics be labeled enemies of the state or terrorists. What will the state do, remove your 501c status from those churches that won't perform the marriages. Will the Fed take over the 75% of welfare and charities that are run by faith-based institutions around the nation in inner cities. There could certainly be some huge ramifications to this decision. Let's just see what unfolds. Im praying we can be civil about this. But with morals it's never pretty. It is odd though, you'll see lgbt protesting christians and catholics. But the Mosques? No. Plus I love how the President is celebrating with everyone on this. But folks have short memories....because he campaigned on an anti-gay marriage platform."

Churches and other religious institutions will not be forced to marry gay couples, that didn't even happen in states where gay marriage has been legal for years.

He is afraid. I don't blame him."
cskb9qe,TheZigerionScammer,"So you basically replied ""You're too unknowledgeable to understand my point, so I won't bother explaining it to you."" That's really condescending, considering the greatest legal qualifications you can claim is to have a cousin who is a legislative writer. That doesn't put you above Tom, Dick, or Harry in terms of legal expertise. If you had any greater tangible qualifications I'm sure you would have stated them. This also means that you're not a legal admin or scholar yourself, which means that by your own words you can't understand the impact either. Not that any of that matters, considering I have a law degree and neither I or any of my friends who are legal scholars have foreseen any legal complications from this decision.That isn't true, of course, but you can say you know Obama himself on here, doesn't make it true. Throw up any reputable legal source to your claim or you're talking nonsense.Same goes for your claim that your pastor friend is scared. That isn't an argument, it isn't even a reputable source even if he does exist. Even if I give you the benefit of the doubt and he does exist, ask yourself whether or not he supports gay marriage and/or if he would ever let gays marry in his church, and if the answer to either is no, especially the former question, then you should ask yourself whether or not he is biased and if it clouds his judgement."
cskhu4b,spitfu,Not like your response is anything of substance either. It's anecdotal as well. But you can't refute the possibility of the impact either. If in a few years we don't see the impact I'll be wrong and thats fine. But it could go the other way. Im saying it's a possibility. Only time will tell.
cskq0t1,TheZigerionScammer,"I haven't used any anecdotes to support my point, aside from my fake anecdote showing you why claiming to know anyone or to have certain qualifications without proof is meaningless. Your first claim is a positive claim on your end, so the onus is on you to show why it is true. Anything presented without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.Your second claim would violate the 1st Amendment. Forcing churches to marry gays would violate their freedom of religious practice. The only institutions that wouldn't be able to turn gays away for marriage would be courthouses. (Some people have claimed that for-profit marriage businesses like the ones in Vegas wouldn't be able to either, but I don't know whether or not that is true and haven't seen any evidence for it.)"
cskuipe,spitfu,"You're entire post was anecdotal. You are speaking as if its fact when in reality there is no difference between legalizing gay marriage, transgendered marriage or poligamy any more then there would be to legalizing marriage between different species. You are in fantasyland and a great deal denial to lightly brush away over 200+ years of legal code and public policy as if it were minuscule and to just loosely refer to that wording as well it just means something different. ""Never mind he is the husband and he is the wife."" That's delusional to think that every court, judge, or magistrate is going to have it interpreted that way. They're going to need that documentation changed otherwise people have a legal standing to have entire cases thrown out due to that. Do you think if you get a speeding ticket for what a cop writes up as 70 in a 60, and you go back and see the speed limit is 70 you still have to pay the fine? No sir that isn't going to happen. Judges throw shit even smaller then that out like the mispelling of a name or address daily."
cskx222,TheZigerionScammer,"God damn, now you're equating the impact that letting homosexuals get married would have with the impact that letting different species get married would have. I couldn't come up with a better strawman charictature of your position if I tried. That's completely ridiculous. I'm saving this post. No one is going to believe me when I tell them that someone actually said this to me.I've said many times, you're making a positive claim, throw up some proof or stop talking about it. You can also explain to me why none of the judges or legal scholars who have ruled in favor of this position have never brought this up. Or hell, even explain to me why the four dissenting judges on the SCOTUS never brought this up either."

csl20rn,TheZigerionScammer,"Whatever you want to believe. I'm not angry, never was, I was dumbfounded. I've given you several opportunities to back your claim up with evidence and you haven't.

Be prepared when random strangers come here months from now and comment on your previous post though. It'll happen sooner or later."
csjo71n,,"In general, it's generally associated with abuse of the people involved and cults of personality more so than anybody trying to actually be married to multiple people. So the state has an interest in protecting people from being abused in an unequal relationship.If women were able to exercise polygamy to the same extent as men, then maybe the argument would be different. Very rarely though do you have A marrying B, A marrying C, and B marrying D. You end up with a patriarchal hierarchy where A just marries B, C, and D and it becomes more of a cartel then a marriage.It also becomes absurdly difficult to figure out how benefits work when the relationship is more than just a couple. On death, do assets get divorced evenly or divided by who contributed what? When you have a scenario like I mentioned above with A marrying B and B marrying C, do you invoke the transitive property and allow A to inherit from C? What about visitation rights in the hospital or child custody?It just becomes a legal and moral nightmare with very few benefits. This gives the state a compelling reason to ban it."

That denying anyone the right to marry is to 'deny them liberties' as protected by the 14th Amendment. It totally does work.That said, section 5 of the 14th amendment basically says ""Congress has the power to enforce this amendment with legislation"" so I agree that would have been much more elegant and appropriate. Thing is, they have refused to do that and it was becoming quite embarrassing, and it was only a matter of time that a case like this one came along to force the issue via the courts. That's what happens when you have an do-nothing congress."
csjktt5,BlazinGator,"One major point of the courts and the Supreme Court at that is to remove the possibility of ""Tyranny of the Majority."" I wish Congress's stopped states impeding people's rights, but when they refuse it's is the duty of the court to uphold the liberties of the minority."

csjfw91,mmcrowle,"Well, the thing is...they DIDN'T legalize gay marriage.They found that bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional. They didn't create a law, they said that the laws that were created were not legally sound. It's essentially a ban of banning gay marriage. Which has the same effect, but is a very important legal distinction. So the court is doing exactly what it was put there to do -- to determine the constitutional validity of laws."
csjg5u8,tempest_87,"That's the thing though. The courts ruling is that *Gay marriage was already legal through the 14th amendment*. Now, if the law of equal protections had a clause of ""except for gays"" like it had with slaves, then yes, it would be judicial overreach to change it. But there is and was no exception. So saying ""this should have been done via legislation"" is just plain wrong, as it was already don't by legislation. I am a fan of the separation of powers and *greatly* dislike when the separations are bridged. But this is simply not one of those times."
csjgkf3,A_Promiscuous_Llama,"The difference between Scalia, for instance, and the more progressive judges is their view on reading the constitution. Scalia argues that the 14th amendment doesn't cover gays, because the authors of the amendment only intended to protect black citizens for example. He thinks we should step into the drafters' shoes to unearth their intent in drafting the legislation. The others see passages like: ""no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States"" and read it to (rightfully, I believe) include a much broader class of people.Scalia will argue that we are stretching the wording of the constitution to accommodate whatever we want, but you have to wonder what he thinks his job is as a judge if not to interpret old text and apply it to modern day cases..."
csjgxb5,tempest_87,"While the intent may have only been to blacks, the wording most certainly is not as the 14th amendment has no ""except"" statement. I understand having to make a decision about the intent of the lawmakers when the law encounters a new situation (like 4th amendment and computers), but I see no logically defensible position that the wording in law (in this case the total lack of it) should be trumped by the possible intentions of those who wrote it. What the dissenters are doing is by definition ""conservative"". They try to argue that things shouldn't change except in legislation. That's all well and good, but like you said, times do change, society changes, and the entire point of the Supreme Court is to adapt the law to modern times without having to fundamentally alter the cornerstone of our government. Edit: typos"

csk38bx,dcman00000,"This is a cherry picked version...This is what he says in his dissent more or less. Here is the link, he starts on page 69. http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf* He talks about legal precedent being demolished here because it has been regarded as a state right for a long time* He talks about a literal plain meaning of the due process clause does not create a right for gay marriage (he's right, but the majority didn't use a plain meaning of the due process clause)* He talks about how any reasonable interpretation of the constitution leaves the issue of marriage in the ninth and tenth amendments...basically meaning that either the people (through representatives for example) or the states themselves are reserved this right. In a purely literal sense he's probably right. But agian the majority didn't use the plain meaning of the text, they used what is colloquially known as ""living breathing document"" legal reasoning. * He talks about how vague issues in the constitution and law are reviewed under what evidence there is to the original intent of those who wrote the law meant. Under this review there is no evidence that in the decades following the ratification of the 14th amendment that the generation that ratified the amendment intended this to mean anything other than the plain meaning of the text. So yeah, its actually more in depth than what the news organizations are leading on, and what is being linked to here on Reddit. In full disclosure **I support gay marriage**, but I can't necessarily disagree with the legal reasoning that scalia put forth. He's basically arguing that the integrity of the constitution was harmed by this decisions, which is an important co-consideration on this case. I believe that to protect our constitution, and our heritage of freedom, democracy, and the principals upon which our society is based than this was the wrong way to do so. So how else do you ask we should've done this? A state by state change would have sufficed, but perhaps would have taken longer ( I grant you that). It would have preserved our constitution in the process however, which is always a good thing, including for our gay brothers and sisters. Another way is through a constitutional amendment, that gave an explicit constitutional right to gay marriage, much harder to achieve, but also protects our constitution and legal system (common law and precedent) in the process. I figured I'd chime in, not because I am against gay marriage (I'm not), but because this discussion on the decision I feel misses important parts of this discussion. Undoubtedly, Scalia has been unfairly pigeonholed as some kind of crazy reactionary by reddit and the media, but this ignores important points I believe he brings up. Essentially what I'm saying is that we should celebrate todays decisions in the sense that freedom won out. However we must also be aware of the pitfalls of the legal reasoning used by the majority, and how problematic that can be to our society and our constitution."

csjgkl2,The_Starmaker,"I *think* what that bloated asshat is trying to say is that the Court is meant to interpret the law instead of overruling it or creating laws of their own. I believe that Scalia is implying that legalizing gay marriage should be a proactive process (requiring states to write laws explicitly allowing it) rather than a unilateral one. Which is bullshit because the Court overrides laws necessarily and consistently. The Court's real purpose is to determine the constitutionality of a law, and by that metric gay marriage bans can never be upheld. This has become pretty evident as of late, as federal court after federal court have struck down gay marriage bans even in the deepest red states.Actually, now that I type it out I think I finally understand this game that many conservatives have been playing. It's part of the whole ""redefining marriage"" argument, the idea that gay marriage should be legal because a law that says ""marriage is between man and woman"" is legally sound and not the same as ""two men cannot marry"". Which holds about as much water as arguing that ""This is an establishment for caucasians only"" is a legal definition.Scalia, Alito, and Thomas (I like to call them SCAT for short) need to remember that their job isn't to open up freedoms to the American people one by one like a mom holding a cookie jar. This is America. If you can't come up with a decent reason why we shouldn't be able to do something, *then* we'll talk about banning it."

csjlh62,overzealous_dentist,"Right, but the constitution never once mentions gay people, marriage itself, or varying versions of marriage. The supreme court normally interprets what the constitution's laws say, but in this case, the supreme court (previously) invented a new right, the right to marry (not based on law), and (today) expanded that right to apply to a new group of people (homosexuals) but not others (poly, etc.). It's entirely arbitrary and not based on founding documents unless you get SUPER abstract and say ""the constitution says equality,"" and if you do THAT and then continue to not allow some groups to not marry, it's even MORE arbitrary."

csjhgpi,acog,"I've heard similar reasoning to Roberts' being expressed with regards to Roe v Wade and abortion rights. One of the reasons (according to this line of argument) that abortion rights are still so bitterly fought against is that opponents feel that it was an anti-democratic overreach by the Court. The underlying premise is that if you let states work out an issue gradually, then eventually if the court has to overrule a few straggler states it is ultimately easier to accept because people can see the democratic process has worked. When the court jumps in while an issue is still hotly debated at the state level it can come across as dictatorial."
csjpbhw,ProlificInquiry,"It was actually Justice Ginsburg who made those comments regarding Roe v. Wade in the past, and if you read Roberts' full dissent on this case, he actually quotes her and applies it here (p. 27 of the Obergefell opinion): >As a thoughtful commentator observed about another issue, ""The policial process was moving . . . , not swiftly enough for advocates of quick, complete change, but majoritarian institutions were listening and acting. Heavy-handed judicial intervention was difficult to justify and appears to have provoked, not resolved, conflict."" Ginsburg, Some thoughts on Autonomy and Equality in Relation to *Roe v.

csjrgcc,ojzoh,"I'm just not sure it's applicable when we are talking about personal liberty. I mean there was all sorts of political discourse during the civil rights movement but in the end the supreme court still needed to make decisions that were unpopular in certain states. Prior to Brown vs board of education 16 states passed law forbidding segregation in schools, almost as many that legislated it (17). That doesn't mean the supreme court should have just waited for the south to change democratically while an entire class of people were being denied their right to equal protection. Hell, when the supreme court struck down the ban on interracial marriage there was plenty of civil discourse as well, but 17 states (guess which ones) still had laws preventing it. Rather than wait for the legislative process to enlighten the south 9 unelected lawyers, I love how the dissents call themselves out as lawyers almost like an insult, made an undemocratic decision, that states do not have the freedom to restrict an individual's freedom to marry because of skin color. Let's be honest here, the supreme court legislating from the bench, usually only gets questioned when you end up disagreeing with the decision. Ever since marshall reinforced judicial supremacy the court has been legislating and most likely stepped outside the bounds of the framers intent. And over all, we as a country are better for it."

In the abstract, this sounds reasonable, but this view presupposes that the 14th Amendment doesn't speak to the right to same-sex marriage. (Which I disagree with).On a practical level, it's hard to buy a judge saying that we should leave marriage to the democratic process, but regulations to control money in elections (which were legislatively enacted with broad public support) should be struck down by the courts, which was famously done 5-4 in *Citizens United*."
csjmr00,Need_you_closer,"I want to point out that regulation of money in elections, as addressed in *Citizens United,* was more a matter of speech (if money is speech, how can groups of citizens express political speech, etc.) which is specifically addressed in the 1st Amendment to the Constitution.

csk0e02,lettucent,"How is that not sexual harassment/assault, regardless of gender? He was sexually touching you and you didn't consent, that is sexual assault, and eeoc's site says it doesn't matter if they're same sex for harassment."
csk2q57,atomicxblue,This was many years ago so it's probably too late to do anything about it. I was young and stupid at the time. I really wish I had the knowledge I had now back then.
csjwzf2,DosAngeles,That's horrible! Did you talk to a lawyer?
csjxaay,atomicxblue,"No I didn't pursue it further because the EEOC said that I'd have no grounds to sue since I wasn't a protected class. They did point out that it would have been a different story if I was a woman, though. The even worse bit is, that this is the second job where this happened, but the first that I reported."

csjjwim,sorator,"And maybe trans* rights, but I doubt that's gonna be a SCOTUS thing.Actually, weed probably won't be either, and I'd be surprised if alternative energy were as well."
csjtk3u,,[deleted]
csjwbgi,send-me-to-hell,Yeah I don't foresee trans* rights being voted in by the public with so many conservative areas. It'll probably have to come down to the SCOTUS. Then again maybe the weed will get people to chill the fuck out about stuff that doesn't affect them.
csjztq9,FrankReshman,"Why are you typing ""trans*""? I've only seen * used as a correction and it doesn't seem like either of you are correcting someone."
csk218s,Wyni201,"Ok I could be wrong but I think it's being used in a ""wildcard"" sense, meaning that the term is including all trans related subgroups. I've usually seen it as LGBT*, meaning all sexual/gender related minorities."
csk2c0z,FrankReshman,"I was considering that, but doesn't the word ""trans"" already do that? It seems unnecessary to me to add the *."
csk91k1,send-me-to-hell,Some people use that word to just mean transexual. On mobile: http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/what-does-the-asterisk-in-trans-stand-for/

csk46mp,ExpAwesome,No idea. But I'm sure they face discrimination somehow
csk7tlb,uncannaevalley,weed might. There is some contention between states with it legalized and states that do not have it legalized.
csjthf0,,This so much. Other people being with who that want is how it should have been the entire time..can we go across the board fixing all of these issues now?

For all those who did not stand idle, who fought for this: We did it. We really did it. It truly would not have happened without us."

csjrgt1,Kymbb,"Why is atheism somehow inherently ""edgy"" on reddit? Though I guess the way he said that was pretty b8."
csjsjvi,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,Atheism isn't. Trying to convert others to atheism or otherwise mock beliefs is. It's possible to think that something is bullshit without having to share that opinion...
csjt9wj,Nevermynde,"Okay, I won't defend that post too much, but please note that I didn't try to convert anyone. That person said they lost their faith a while ago, so I'm assuming they are over it now, and suggesting that they are not the worse off for it. My main point though was that getting estranged from one's family is a much tougher blow."
csjtjv9,VagabondSamurai,"Fuck the downvotes man. You ever notice how you never see the same level of rage whenever someone who has ""found christ"" or some shit writes a post?Can you imagine someone saying they found god, you saying ""good for you,"" then some asshat saying that you were trying to convert others and that you were mocking the beliefs of others?Nope. That kind of thoughtless, doublestandard really gets old....guess I should say it should be a ""double-edged"" sword or some shit.....whooooooh"
csl7yeq,Nevermynde,"Yup, I'm glad I don't look for meaning for my life in either religion or upvotes."
csjtttd,Archleon,So why are you sharing yours?
csju2jl,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"I'm answering a question. Unless you're a psychic, I sincerely doubt you can glean from that post what my personal thoughts are on religion."
csju7po,Archleon,>Trying to convert others to atheism or otherwise mock beliefs is.That's not sharing an opinion? Ok then.
csjurwo,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"I never said I wasn't giving an opinion, I stated the reason *why* I gave an opinion. This isn't hard to understand."
csjutg3,Archleon,"Ah, so you're a hypocrite. Roger. Just wanted to be sure."
csjuxc1,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,Explanation? I'm really getting the feeling that you didn't think this through.
csjv20r,Archleon,"How is this hard? You bitched about someone sharing an opinion, and in doing so you shared an opinion. ""It's possible to keep it to yourself"" after all, right?"
csjv9py,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"No, I didn't. Literally find me a quote where I bitched. The only thing that I see which could possibly be construed as bitching was ""Trying to convert others to atheism or otherwise mock beliefs is [edgy]"". Not a value judgment, no request for it to stop, no complaints that it's happening.Someone literally congratulated a random stranger on the internet for losing something that, presumably, was pretty important to them, in a completely unsolicited manner. My answer was solicited and not directed towards someone who was obviously recounting a serious and painful event in their life."
csjvbd3,Archleon,Holy shit you really are that dense. I thought you were being purposely obtuse. Alright then.
csjvgjp,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"* Doesn't really understand the meaning of hypocrisy.* Can't find a specific quote with only a dozen lines of text to sort through.* Probably doesn't understand ""unsolicited"".* Lack of empathy.* Resorts to insults when logical arguments fail (early and often).Middle school must be rough. Do you want to talk about it?"
csjvjhq,Archleon,"No, I just learn real quick when someone is too stupid to know they're stupid. Your lists are pretty, at least."
csjvrp7,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"Hrm, and you mostly want to talk about negative things but you managed to throw in a little positivity there at the end. Not to be an armchair psychologist, but you should seriously talk to somebody. Looks like you've got some constructive thoughts, but with the amount of time and effort you're willing to go through to tear someone down over nothing, you might have trouble actually going through with them."
csk5p22,Kymbb,>It's possible to think that something is bullshit without having to share that opinion...So people are only allowed to share opinions that are in line with yours? lol
csk5t3o,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"Are you really going to ask a question, then complain and downvote when someone answers it?"
cskdmyx,Kymbb,"Notice that I didn't complain about your answer, I complained about that little piece of bullshit you added onto the end."

The way I always thought about it, being 18 year old, is this: at this point in my life with some fairly close hindsight, I gladly accept ""missing"" the ""privilege"" of not having a mother and father that lived together to raise me in order for millions of LGBT citizens of America to secure their love and devotion for each other.And I think I turned out alright in the end. ;)"
cslx65a,precordial_thump,"Absolutely.The respondents' claim was so asinine. It was, basically, if you make marriage about love for one another, instead of about raising your biological children, people won't have as many children, and that's not in the State's interest.Quoted from the transcript:>If this Court ensconces in the Constitution a new definition of marriage and it reduces the rate that opposite-­sex couples stay together, bound to their children, because of that different understanding, even a 1 percent change is many, many children.>A reasonable voter, again, looking at the two couples that I just described, one believing that marriage is all about staying with their kids, the other one believing it's all about emotion and commitment, could have different results.[Arguments: Question One - Full Transcript](http://int.nyt.com.s3.amazonaws.com/data/scotus/2014/14-556q1_11o2.pdf)"

My friend wasn't on speaking terms with them for a while after that. They've been waiting for this for a long time, for the chance to be able to marry without having to elope or runaway to some other place and ruin the entire meaning of why they were together, and seeing this news made me the happiest I've been in a while.The Supreme Court made a decision that will let people be themselves and enjoy life with the person that means the most to them."

csjg6rz,iamfriedsushi,"Growing up, I was extremely homophobic. My mother had difficulty understanding this, and asked several times what someone else's orientation had to do with my life. I made up all kinds of bullshit reasons, often resorting to ""it's just wrong"". Fast forward to my college years, I found myself having a conversation with one of my mentors about equal rights and equality, in general. That mentor echoed the same thing my mother had said years earlier. These two women made a profound impact on my life, and showed me how irrational my homophobia was. How fitting that what would have been my mother's 63rd birthday, the SCOTUS reminds us of the same thing my mother and mentor did years ago. Love is love. Thanks mother! Edit: Thanks for the gold!"
csjit4l,,"Well my situation is almost completely opposite. I woke up this morning to all of this and when I told my mom she turned around with the biggest look of disgust I've seen and said ""Did they really"". Not in a good way either. Then my dad spouted off something that made no sense that their must be more gays than straight people. Made me remember why I want to move out so bad and will be soon. Also I'm straight but still I can't fucking stand blind hatred of things that have no real reason to be disliked. Also the end times are almost here according to my mother. -_-"
csjjedu,iamfriedsushi,Wow...That's insane. My mother taught me to live and let live. It's been a wonderful life guiding philosophy for me.
csjk8n3,Necrohol,"At least you are not blind with hatred as well, and that's something really good! I hope you move out and find amazing people to befriend."
csjkbxl,,Thanks. I plan on moving out very soon and moving out of state where there are some people I've been friends with for a few years. :D
csjla1u,octopoddle,"I hate to try advising people of anything( because I'm a bit of a shambles myself) but if I may then can I please suggest that you try not to hold it against your parents too much or waste too much time trying to convince them that you're wrong.They grew up with certain prejudices that you, thankfully, didn't have to. Fortunately they failed to pass them on to you, and kudos for that. Getting into arguments about it or trying to avoid contact won't likely achieve anything much, and forgiving them for their ignorance is a measure of your ability to accept in a way that they never probably will.TLDR: Love the sinner, hate the sin. There's already too much hate out there. Let's make this about love."

csjkl1d,Accalon-0,"I'm not sure how to phrase it, but do you feel like you were just naturally homophobic, or can you remember some kind of influence that would have made you that way?"
csjl9sc,iamfriedsushi,"Oddly enough, it was something that I didn't care about until folks started talking about it. As an opinionated child in the church, I thought I had to have an opinion. Originally, my rationale was that it (gay marriage) was sinful and unnatural. Then, it moved to the ""it's just wrong"" rationale. I should mention that I also had people in my life (friends, classmates, etc) who influenced and encouraged the ""it's just wrong"" rationale. Going away to college and having a mentor I trusted who echoed my mother's sentiments was instrumental. She (the mentor) was very candid and non-judgemental with her questions of me and how I felt. She made sense. Just plain, logical sense. As an aside, there's a quote in my office that says, ""Lessons are repeated until they are learned."" Thanks to my mentor and mother, I learned a valuable lesson."

I actually thank Chick-fil-a for that, if I didn't see the juxtaposition of love the gays were showing compared to the hate the Christians were showing, I may still be a bigot today.

They were all like, ""Oh, so which one is being the bride?"" and ""So does the other one have a hen do? (Bachelorette party?)"". However, when my ten year old son wanted an explanation of what a stag weekend was, he then asked if my friend's wife-to-be was going to have a party too. I said well, my friend is marrying another man and he is having his own party too. The boy didn't bat an eyelid and was just like ""cool"". Yay for the next generation!"

My justification might be that my dog is a child, and children have the right to public education.Someone might say, ""But this is not a child.""And I say, ""It is a child. I've raised it from birth, I feed and love it, and I am responsible for its well-being.""Imagine there were a surge of people insisting that the government educate their pets, and make allowances for their ""special needs"".People might start out saying it was silly, but as the movement grew and some states started legalizing ""pet parenthood"", people might get very angry. ""Saying a dog is a child does damage to actual children. Animals are not children and they never have been.""This is the ""appeal to tradition"". We have never viewed animals as children, and so the idea that we suddenly have to start because some ""crazy"" people want us to might be very appalling.Again, I'm playing devil's advocate, and I fully support equal marriage rights, but hopefully this can help you understand/empathize with the opposition."

Explain that faith requires sacrifice and personal standards that might be higher or different from the secular world and that love for everyone is commanded despite their lifestyles. In short it's not OK within our personal belief sets, but that doesn't make it OK not to love and respect them anyway. Examples being kosher, Ramadan, lent, vegetarianism, and alcohol in some faiths regarding diet. Others can consume those things we cannot.

I think gluttony is saying don't horde everything, share with those around you.The way I've always understood it is that it's about controlling yourself. You know? The reason why gluttony is bad is because you cannot control yourself.Proverbs 23:20-21 warns us, “Do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat, for drunkards and gluttons become poor, and drowsiness clothes them in rags.” Proverbs 28:7 declares, “He who keeps the law is a discerning son, but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father.” Proverbs 23:2 proclaims, “Put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony.”"

You think gays shouldn't have the right to be married because it's against your own personal moral code and you don't want to have to explain to your kids why there is no problem with being gay because you're afraid that it might ""turn them"".People from the 1860s through the early 1970s didn't want blacks to vote, own land, have rights, or be viewed as free citizens, because, morally, they viewed themselves as superior people.

I am condemning the act, not the person, even though it was essentially their decisions that led them there.Same reason I don't care about a smoker's lungs, or a drinkers liver. It's affecting them directly, and us indirectly.This decision isn't about the act. That's the problem. How you feel about gay people, what they do in the bedroom, where they go on dates, what their pet names for each other are, or what specific sexual acts they engage in has nothing at all to do with their right to the same government treatment as you and I. If you can't separate gay sex from gay marriage, that's what makes you a bigot.> It's the influence that is reeking from this movement, If anything.http://www.wnd.com/2013/07/gay-laws-set-stage-for-pedophilia-rights/I'm sorry. Maybe you aren't a bigot. You're just clinically insane. You really think that making it illegal for states to decide that gays can't marry is at all relatable to pedophilia? Really? You know one thing I know about gays? For the most part, they are also very much against pedophilia. Just like you and me. Do you know what group has a history of pedophilia that dates back to the 1940s? The Catholic Church.> You can prove me wrong, easy... Again...You cannot claim to say that homosexuality is morally acceptable whilst incest, paedophilia and bestiality are not.There is not a single argument for homosexuality which cannot also be used to support those sexual practices as well.Lawful heterosexual relations help accomplish the natual biological existence of mankind. Hm...Incest, paedophilia, and bestiality have nothing to do with homosexuality. Nothing at all. To even put homosexuality in that category just further displays the levels of your bigotry. If you truly can't decipher the difference between these acts, then this conversation isn't worth having.> I'm a disgusting bigot because why? Because I can't accept something that is completely wrong? If the approval of the people not concerned mattered so little why was their opinion considered in the Supreme court?You do realize that this case has nothing at all to do with your right to feel something is wrong, right? You can go on hating gays all you want...oh I'm sorry..you can go on loving and appreciating gays, but hating everything that makes them who they are. You just don't have the right now to tell them they don't deserve the same basic human rights that you do.And procreation also has NOTHING to do with this. There are plenty of people who go their entire lives, married or single, without having children. Should we throw them in jail for not fulfilling their Godly duties?

Athiests have no fixed code of morality and constantly change their values according to new ideas, cultures and opinions.I honestly don't care what religion you are. Your religious beliefs have nothing at all to do with determining the rights of someone to get married. I don't need a fantasy book to tell me the difference between right and wrong, regardless of who your particular book's main character is.> Once again, how do you define when is the appropriate age and manner of giving consent? When do children reach sexual maturaity? When do you distinguish the transition between a child and adult? All of these questions cannot be firmly answered unless you develop a fixed moral code.Well, in America, we have these things called laws, see. They determine exactly what the age of consent. If enough people don't agree with the determination, we can go through the channels to change it. As far as whether you are American or not, that has as much to do with this as your religion. Whether you are from this country or not, your personal belief system doesn't get to determine whether people have equal rights. My only real assumption was assuming you had the rationale to discuss this as a purely political matter and not as a religious issue that makes you feel bad. I'm sorry that your particular god of choice didn't equip with the necessary moral code to treat people as equals based on who they are and not on who they love."

csjh57f,chumb0slice,"I don't speak for anyone but myself obviously but I think you're misinterpreting the stance of conservatives on this issue. The idea is quite the opposite of what you posit. Rather than viewing ourselves as mere individuals in a larger society, conservatives or traditionalists view each individual as a cog in a machine. One in turn affects everything else in the machine in the slightest of ways at first (think butterfly effect). So yes while gay marriage doesn't affect you or me today in any meaningful way, it might in the future or for our kids, at least what we want for them (speaking here from the stance of a conservative). With a given understanding that conservatives view gay marriage as unnatural, having it legitimized in society to them is very much a violation of what they believe is right for human society at large because it brings into the forefront something that to them is disallowed. Not arguing for or against here, just offering another perspective. The fact that the Supreme Court is re interpreting Constitutional law based on popular opinion is interesting because it might set a precedent, and a dangerous one at that. Anyway, my hope now is that we can turn our attention and focus to helping other marginalized groups in this country with their rights. Like African Americans and women. But that involves change that may affect a lot of people immediately, and that's difficult. Gay marriage was easy to support because it's a feel good effort with very little societal impact. We are talking about a group that's less than 6% of the population. Pennies. Helping African Americans against white supremacy or women against discrimination and abuse is a whole different ball game that I don't think our society has the appetite to change for."

csjetex,Rad_Spencer,">Roberts from bench: ""Today 5 lawyers have ordered every state to change their definition of marriage. Just who do we think we are?""You're the supreme court, it's literally what you do....."
csjhzgi,,I think the point is that states are having their power taken away and that goes against his interpretation of the constitution.
csjl2yl,ARandomKid781,"The same argument was used here in Iowa - the judges were ""legislating from the bench""Problem being they didn't make any new laws, and if they *can't* do it we may as well not have judges period since they'd become entirely useless as this is effectively their entire job. The only difference is some people don't like it this time."
csjt0a8,Neri25,"It was going to happen eventually. Having a system where half the states allow gay marriage and half do not was unmaintainable. Unlike Roberts I do not have the confidence in the people of this nation required to say ""well eventually everyone would have come around"". It took Brown vs Board to desegregate schools. It took Loving vs Virginia to desegregate marriage. Our own history suggests that we do not have a good track record on letting these things run out their course."
csjqkq6,Primarycolors1,Competing rights. It is literally his job to determine which is more important.
csjqzce,,"Yep, and he thinks his colleagues made the wrong decision."
csjnlfo,Nicklovn,Theyre upholding the constitution. The 14th amendment might have been made for former black slaves but the wording is broad and encompasses all citizens.
csjnpoq,,"Sure, not saying I agree with him."
csjq3pu,,Hey! We just went through this over a flag!
csjv36o,HowAboutShutUp,"Sucks to be him, I guess."
csjv3mg,,Yeah I guess it does.
csk33hw,,"The problem with that argument is that states are not the final arbiter on the interpretation of the Constitution in the first place, so you're taking away a power that they don't have to begin with. Sure states have the power to decide their own marriage laws, but if those laws conflict with the Constitution, the Supremacy Clause dictates that the Constitution shall prevail."
csjr3p2,cant_be_pun_seen,"Nobody cares that people are being thrown in jail for smoking a plant because of federal law, but its a big deal to be granted equal rights because of federal law?"
csjgupk,,"His point isn't terrible, it's just no useful here. Those states definition of marriage have been democratically decided."
csjhz9u,ericphilbin,"So were the bans on interracial marriages. *Sometimes*, it's the job of SCOTUS to overturn even democratically decided laws."
csji8ro,Rahmulous,However race is a protected class under the Equal Protection Clause. Sexual orientation is not. Chief Justice Roberts is arguing that the Constitution does not give these nine unelected people the right to decide a (seemingly) non-Constitutional issue for over 320 million people.
csjiiay,5th_Vote,"This guy gets it. ^^ I am glad the court decided as it did, but the issue wasn't simply ""Do you support gay marriage?"", just a bit more complicated, those pesky constitutional issues and all."
csjih67,Vilsetra,"Is sexual orientation not a protected class under anything, or just not the Equal Protection Clause?"
csjjcp7,rankor572,"The only other option would be a statute, and there's certainly no statute listing sexual orientation as a protected class. Even then, in the wake of City of Boerne that hypothetical statute naming sexual orientation as a protected class might be unconstitutional as overreaching the 14th Amendment's enforcement powers."
csjiw4u,ericphilbin,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but protected classes aren't a part of the Equal Protection Clause. That is to say, equal protection isn't granted only to those in a protected class."
csjjlft,Rahmulous,"Change the terminology a bit, from protected class to suspect class, and it is within the EPC. Basically, the EPC works to assure that all rights are equally given equally to all, without discrimination to any suspect class. The suspect classes are race, national origin, skin color, religion, sex, age, disability, etc. Now, the other part of the EPC deals with fundamental rights. These are rights so important that they apply to literally every person, regardless of suspect classification. This is where this ruling comes in. The justices ruled 5-4 that marriage is a fundamental right within the EPC afforded to everyone equally.The good part for homosexuals in this ruling is that it obviously affords them this fundamental right to marry. But people are getting confused about the suspect classification. SCOTUS did not give sexual orientation suspect classification, which means that laws like the Indiana one about businesses not being forced to cater gay weddings or do business with homosexuals is still completely legal."
csjsuqu,bitbybit3,"As I understand it, the EPC works to assure that equal rights are afforded to all, the text is broad and there are no classifications in the constitution. The SCOTUS has mandated that different levels of judicial review must be used based upon classifications that it itself assigns. Suspect classifications (e.g. race) must have strict scrutiny applied, quasi-suspect classifications (e.g. gender) must have intermediate scrutiny applied and all others can have rational review basis.If proper logic were used, this would be a clear-cut case of quasi-suspect classification under gender and a unanimous decision made. But unfortunately humans are complicated and logic is difficult.> SCOTUS did not give sexual orientation suspect classificationWhich is unfortunate, they should be given at least quasi-suspect classification. Then again, how can sexual orientation even be a classification if sexual activity between consenting adults is constitutionally protected privacy. But they are certainly likely to be discriminated against, so should be afforded heightened scrutiny under the EPC."
csjkv9f,bitbybit3,"A couple of things here.The constitution does not set up a protected class, the SCOTUS set up classifications known as ""suspect"" and ""quasi-suspect"", which require a specific level of judicial scrutiny be applied to equal protection disputes involving people under these classifications. This precedent was set up because these groups were deemed to be the likely subject of discrimination and so heightened scrutiny was determined necessary in all disputes involving their equal protection. Race is a suspect classification which is afforded strict scrutiny, gender is a quasi-suspect classification which is afforded intermediate scrutiny, and any other disputes not involving these classifications are afforded rational basis review.Now, if you want to compare same-sex marriage to interracial marriage, you are looking at race vs. gender, not race vs. sexual orientation, because these marriage bans apply to non-inter-gender marriages. A gay man could always have married a gay woman, but a straight man could not have married a straight man under these laws. So at the very least, logically you should apply intermediate scrutiny to these laws.At least 2 appellate courts have applied heightened scrutiny to sexual-orientation and at least one has ruled sexual-orientation a quasi-suspect classification. If you look at things objectively, it's pretty hard to argue that sexual-orientation should not be afforded heightened scrutiny because they have certainly been proven to be likely to be discriminated.Furthermore, even if you apply rational basis review to same-sex marriage bans, there is still no good argument that the states have legitimate government interest in these unequal protection laws.I haven't gone through the SCOTUS ruling so I don't know if they specified what level of scrutiny they applied, but the dissent just doesn't make a lick of sense. Under strict and intermediate scrutiny, it's a pretty clear case that there isn't compelling government interest here. And even going with rational basis review, they are grasping at straws to suggest that governments have some sort of interest in protecting a definition of marriage that is applied on an unequal basis. It just doesn't make any rational sense.The actual text of the fourteenth amendment:> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.This equal protection of the laws does not apply only to racial groups, it applies to all people. The only thing classifications do are mandate a specific level of scrutiny that must be applied, they don't even forbid heightened scrutiny for other cases. The banning of same-sex marriage was denying people equal protection under marriage laws, and there really isn't a good argument for even a minimally legitimate government interest."
csjnli8,,And isn't that part of the point of higher government over local government?
csjhfk3,jm419,He's also correct - the Supreme Court is not a legislative body.
csji61q,,They didn't legislate today. They struck down certain unconstitutional laws.
csjz1gm,just_comments,They anti-legislated.
csjk12a,jm419,Roberts seems to think they legislated.
csjkhkt,,"I understand that, but legislating means making laws. The Supreme Court is interpreting an existing law...the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution."
csjkugo,jm419,"Right - I think the issue Roberts has is that he believes they overstepped their authority. Personally, I'm no legal expert, but it seems reasonable that the Supreme Court *can* tell Mississippi that its marriage laws are unconstitutional. It *can't* tell Mississippi that it has to allow same-sex marriages, just that it can't ban them. It's up to the individual state to define marriage, not the Supreme Court.As an engineer who knows nothing about law, that's how I interpret Roberts' dissent."
csjkzjo,,"The decision was made based on the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court said the EPC prevents states from discriminating against homosexuals by preventing them from getting married when heterosexuals can. So yes, it's up to Mississippi to define marriage, but if that definition discriminates on the basis of sexuality, it's not going to fly. In other words, the Supreme Court is effectively saying that you either have to let homosexuals marry or not let anyone marry.>I think the issue Roberts has is that he believes they overstepped their authority.Yes, that is what he thinks, but that makes no sense. Their job is to interpret the constitution. In this case, it was the 14th Amendment. If they overstepped their authority in this case, then they did in *Brown v. Board of Education* too. Is that what he thinks?"
csjq6f4,,"Hell, he would think they overstepped their authority in *Marbury v. Madison* if he thinks that.With that line of thinking, why did he even get into law?"
csjl2d7,jm419,"Ok, that makes more sense. Thanks for the info!"
csjsfwy,bitbybit3,"> The Supreme Court said the EPC prevents states from discriminating against homosexuals by preventing them from getting married when heterosexuals can.A heterosexual man and a heterosexual man could not get married with these marriage bans, a homosexual man and a homosexual woman could, so looks like the laws didn't technically address sexual orientation."
csju5ls,,"I hope you're not actually trying to advance that as an argument. That's sort of like someone in the 1960s saying, ""A white person can't go to any of those shitty black universities either...so it's all equal."""
csjuo2d,bitbybit3,"Advance what as an argument? I made a factual observation.As for the subsequent argument...Same-gender marriage bans are directly parallel to different-race marriage bans. The laws are technically **gender** based, and as such should have been struck down with a unanimous decision under intermediate scrutiny based on gender's quasi-suspect classification. I do also think that sexual orientation should be granted quasi-suspect classification at the least, if you were wondering.The bottom line is that it is absolutely ludicrous that so many people don't understand the direct parallel between interracial marriage and intragender marriage is race and **gender** not race and ""who am I attracted to""."
csjvinc,,"Maybe I understood what you were trying to say. So it sounds like you're saying there are two different ways to get to the same result? It could be viewed as discrimination based on gender, and it could also be viewed as discrimination based on sexual orientation?"
csjvwym,bitbybit3,"Indeed.As for the Supreme Court, the gender argument should have been open-and-closed, there's no logical way to argue out of it, it's literally intra-gender marriage and gender requires intermediate scrutiny, whereas the sexual orientation argument has a lot more leeway in that it only needs rational basis.Obviously sexual orientation plays a role here as it is an immutable trait that leads to the desire of which gender you may want to marry. But if you apply strict logic to the laws, it quite literally discriminated against gender based on your own gender in the same way interracial marriage bans discriminated against race based on your own race."
csk3ejr,,"Justice Kennedy has always been an avid applier of rational basis to issues of gay rights. Romer, Lawrence, Windsor and this case were all decided from a rational basis perspective. While it could be argued that gay marriage should warrant intermediate scrutiny on the basis of gender discrimination or even strict scrutiny on the basis that homosexuals constitute a suspect classification (or that marriage is a fundamental right which warrants strict scrutiny), if the laws cannot even meet rational basis there is no need to even get to that analysis. I've always assumed that this was a tactical move by Justice Kennedy, essentially avoiding having to grant homosexuals any higher analysis than rational basis. I believe only one federal court has every applied anything higher than rational basis to homosexuals, and in that case it was intermediate scrutiny."
csjl208,Elcactus,Because Roberts is pretending the 14th amendment doesn't exist.
csjhtuh,flychance,"I must say, while I am 100% for the decision and extremely happy, I agree with the idea that SCOTUS doesn't exist to make laws. However, the concept of judicial review has existed since Marbury v Madison and you can't decide to review one law and not another. So picking and choosing when you think judicial review is correct is ridiculous."
csjjhvf,,"Seems suspicious that the SC gave itself a power that wasn't in the Constitution, then they pretend to be the best at interpreting the document"
csjkp4j,question_sunshine,"That's sort of over simplifying it as far as Marbury v. Madison and the doctrine of judicial review goes. At least until the Dickerson opinion in 2000, which is when the Court finally got fed up and said:> But Congress may not legislatively supersede our decisions interpreting and applying the Constitution. Meaning effectively, the Constitution says whatever the hell the Supreme Court decides it says."
csjjtrc,US-20,"Well, the system isn't and can't be perfect. Common law and federalism guarantee that it won't ever be even close to perfect."
csjk91b,jm419,"No, I agree with you completely. The laws did need to be reviewed, but Roberts seemed to think they overstepped and infringed on state rights."
csjjiic,sorator,"I think the majority opinion could've been a touch better reasoned, and the dissenting opinions make some points that should've been refuted (because they definitely could've been). I also worry a touch about this court deciding what they want the law to be and then finding legal justification to make it so, which is... backwards.That being said, I absolutely agree with the decision and I don't think they were out of line to make it."
csjnp2v,mistervanilla,In what way do you think they could have been refuted? I know very little of the American constitution and justice system and I am unclear on how the dissenting opinions are 'wrong' in the sense that the constitution does not apply to this case.
csjohg6,sorator,"Only actually read one of the four dissents thus far, but:Roberts *basically* is arguing from the standpoint that SCOTUS just decided that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right, and points out that the court is supposed to meet certain requirements before determining new fundamental rights and they didn't and can't do that with same-sex marriage.Counterpoint: SCOTUS didn't decide that *same-sex* marriage is a fundamental right; they decided that *marriage* is a fundamental right which has thus far not been afforded to same-sex couples. In fact they didn't even *decide* that today; they decided that *decades* ago and have upheld it in a number of cases since.(Some explanation: Constitutional rights are guaranteed to every US citizen by the 14th amendment. These constitutional rights include ""enumerated"" rights explicitly mentioned in the constitution, like the 1st amendment right to freedom of speech, as well as ""fundamental"" rights which aren't explicitly mentioned but still protected. Marriage falls into the latter category.)That's the main one; the others ones are pretty small/silly stuff. (Roberts said we're circumventing the democratic process; yes, but that's what SCOTUS *does*, they just have to justify it, which they did but Roberts said they didn't. Roberts said that there's a difference between overturning bans on interracial marriage, which SCOTUS did ages ago, and this; that's pretty clearly not the case. Roberts argues that extending marriage to same-sex couples changes the definition of marriage in a way that extending marriage to interracial couples, couples including a prisoner, and couples including someone who owed back child support was not; that seems a very silly argument. And more of the same.)"
csjoxct,mistervanilla,"Thanks. I read the first few pages of the majority opinion and the fact that Marriage had been established as a fundamental right through multiple SCOTUS cases was something it touched upon in great detail. I guess it does come down to a *definition* of marriage, as chief justice Roberts says, but to define marriage as between a man and a woman, feels like a ridiculous technicality. If society accepts love between same-sex couples, and marriage is a fundamental right, any definition of marriage would be inconsistent if it precluded same-sex couples and thereby deny them that fundamental right."
csjsyp8,ThatFargoDude,"Rights are not something you put up to a vote. Had desegregation been put to a vote in the 50s it would have failed, too."
csjt3aa,jm419,"Ok - here's how rights work.Everyone had the *same* rights - gay people by virtue of being gay did not lose the right to marry someone of the opposite gender. They chose not to exercise that right, just as many choose not to exercise their 2nd Amendment rights. Everyone had the same rights. That's equality under the law.The question was, whether same-sex marriage qualified as marriage. The Supreme Court says it does. End of discussion. This is a net win for everyone. We all now have the rights to marry any (living adult consenting) human we choose."

csjf022,Hard_boiled_Badger,"I have a problem with people having too much power to determine what is ""evil""."
csjf1qp,,I agree
csjg1id,Hard_boiled_Badger,"It's obvious that we both understand how that can be applied in defense of both sides. Which was my point in saying it. But back to your original reply. Apathy should be an equally respected decision as proactive action in regard to a policy/cause/perceived injustice. Especially in the united States where our country is a wholly unique place in the world. A man can go through his life and not worry about anything outside of his hometown or family. He can live, be happy, and die. How can anyone fault him for doing that? Not having to worrying himself with the troubles of the things outside his world."
csjgqnm,,"> How can anyone fault him for doing that?You can't fault him for that, but if he chooses to speak out in hate towards those that are different than him, we can fault him for that."

My super liberal progressive boss at work was already all over me for not caring...like dude I'm not against it just because I'm not out celebrating...I simply don't care either way.
csjg69a,TheWatersOfMars,"I'm celebrating because my country has just become a bit more free, a bit more fair for millions of people. This ruling means that a whole group of people who, only a short while ago, couldn't even publicly acknowledge their sexuality can now get married, have kids, and live their lives the way they want to. Just because I'm not part of that group doesn't mean I don't want to celebrate such a historic change."
csjgu7c,pbs094,Yeah that makes sense...maybe it's because I'm from Boston and it's been legal here for 10 years already.

csjit86,yuube,"Not everything but a lot of things yes, it is a very easy argument though to say this doesn't affect most people and is not comparable to a lot of the real problems this country and world face. We have people starving to death in Africa yet gay marriage has been one of our biggest debates for the past while? It's just ridiculous."
csjm2h6,TheWatersOfMars,"Well, stopping poverty and starvation in another continent isn't an immediately achievable goal. Equal rights, though..."
csjuove,yuube,"I would say people living in back woods fucked up countries in the middle east and Africa that are continuously being exploited and fucked aren't exactly getting equal rights, in a much worse way Than gay people in America."
csjwpt2,TheWatersOfMars,"That's true, but Americans can't really fix that in the same way they can at home. Just because other places are worse off doesn't mean that progress at home shouldn't be celebrated!"

csjf7o0,marzolian,"I was in Oklahoma last month, reading in the paper about the Tulsa Pride parade, and it struck me: Oklahoma had gay marriage before Texas?"
csjhbl7,nickpeq,"Only by a federal ruling. The state government did everything in their power to oppose gay marriage.If the Supreme Court hadn't made a sweeping decision today, each state would have individually been dragged into federal rulings over time.http://assets.bwbx.io/images/ipfKOClZnH5Q/v3/-1x-1.png"
csjiorw,marzolian,"I know, I know. It was just surprising, a little bit, to see that it had become a non-issue so quickly. The guests of honor included some government representatives and the first gay couple married in Oklahoma."
csjem9u,rufusbarleysheath,I'm very interested to see how Texas will try to find a way to avoid actually having to issue marriage licenses to gay couples.
csjepvx,,"Here in Alabama there was a bill considered by the legislature to end the issuance of marriage licenses completely. Which would of course cause a colossal clusterfuck. But collossal clusterfucks are what the Alabama legislature specalizes in. I fully expect our Chief Justice, Roy Moore, to issue an order stopping all marriages before the day is out."
csjet7x,project_valient,In NC a magistrate can withdraw from performance of any marriage in order to avoid issuing licenses to same-sex couples.
csjewaa,,"See, that is IMO, bullshit. If you are a minister, you should not be compelled to perform gay marriages. But if you are a court official, you should not have the power to pick and choose who you will perform the duties of your office for. All people should be equal before the law. I see that s having no difference than a magistrate saying you can't sue a guy who wrecked your car, because you are gay."
csjge3f,project_valient,Before they passed that law they had several magistrates straight up resign in protest of the court ruling. When the new law passed the local news went and interviewed some of those people asking if they wanted their jobs back now...
csjfoad,_LunaLovegood_,*That'll* preserve the sanctity of marriage! Haha!(Is Roy Moore secretly a Vaudeville villain?)

csjgb5z,alohadave,"Before the ruling, I would say to get the government out of the marriage business. Let religion have the word marriage, and the government have civil unions. Anyone who is legal age could be united by the government, and churches could limit marriages to anyone they want since it would be a purely religious ceremony, and in no way legally binding.But now, it's a moot point."
csjhhif,Danimals847,"Yeah, separate but equal! That's never gotten us in trouble before."
csjhqzc,Byzantine279,Nah. He was saying get rid of all marriage.
csjh5xb,Aaron215,"That's okay, they're required to recognize out of state marriage licenses. Just hop the border."
csjidqs,dressageaddict,"I sorta hope that happens, just so that I can laugh at the stupidity"
csjfhb5,crybannanna,Hahaha. That would be a perfect response from Alabama. Make all marriage illegal. If weird how an entire state can be a perpetual embarrassment. Time to break out the old Neil Young song again.
csjexgf,ResonantOne,"Oh, but that's the great thing.The Dallas County Assessor has stated that he would begin issuing marriage licenses within minutes if this ruling came through, and he would be extending the hours of his office to meet the demand."
csjeu02,Hard_boiled_Badger,They will fight for people who have religious objection to it to not have to participate in the process but they will have to legally recognize it. Beyond that I don't see much changing.
csjf6q8,rufusbarleysheath,"I don't know any gay person who would want to force a church who does not agree with gay marriage to perform their ceremony. This is a federal recognition issue, not a religious one."
csjfjco,Hard_boiled_Badger,"That is what worries me. We can take your anecdotal experience and say ""well everything is fine. Those with a religious objection will still be protected."" But looking at recent history we know that isn't the case. The militant response to the Indiana pizzeria who answered a hypothetical question proves that. These battles to protect individuals right to religious freedom are going to, and will need to, take place."
csjf95z,alittlelessconvo,Looks like all you need to do is take a trip to [San Antonio](http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Bexar-County-ready-to-issue-marriage-licenses-to-6347830.php).

csjjmoy,travelinlite,"As a former Mississippian, I just hope this is accepted better than how we handled the civil rights movement. I have a feeling that just because it's legal now, the attitude of many will remain the same, and the hatred grow even more furious."

csjf9vj,,"He promised to tell you made up stories, and he sticks to his guns."
csjitww,Dicho83,Not even a man of the 'Good Word' really.
csjlrgu,dontknowmeatall,"Ecclesiastes 5:4-5 ESVWhen you vow a vow to God, do not delay paying it, for he has no pleasure in fools. Pay what you vow. It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.Numbers 30:1-2 ESVMoses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the people of Israel, saying, “This is what the Lord has commanded. If a man vows a vow to the Lord, or swears an oath to bind himself by a pledge, he shall not break his word. He shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.Matthew 5:33 ESV“Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.'**James 5:12 ESV****But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your “yes” be yes and your “no” be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.**"
csjfdec,Byrnhildr_Sedai,"He never said he would kill himself, his comment was taken out of context by the media.[His quote was ](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/texas-pastor-rick-scarborough-is-willing-to-be-burned-to-death-to-oppose-gay-marriage-10333602.html)""We are not going to bow, we are not going to bend, and if necessary we will burn.""It's clearly metaphorical, not a literally ""I'm going to immolate myself""."

csjixih,heavystrange,Exactly. those are also way better!
csjjv0x,Givemeawayoutofhere,Hopes dashed.
csjevlv,Haephestus,"Serious question: does this mean that religions will be forced to perform gay marriage, or do they retain the right to refuse them if their individual doctrines forbid it?"
csjf0on,c_oliver,I am pretty sure a Christian church can refuse to marry anyone.
csjf6hg,PunnyBanana,"That's been the entire issue. This gives same sex couples the right to be legally married but it doesn't mean that religious ministers will be forced to do it but you don't have to be a religious minister to perform a ceremony. Various ministers of various religions have different standards for if a couple should be married like the couple must actively practice that religion, do pre-marital counseling, or whatever. Especially in the types of states where companies aren't forced to cover birth control under insurance due to religious beliefs, ministers most likely won't be forced to marry people due to religious beliefs. However, the issue hasn't been that gay people can't get married in churches, it's been that gay people can't get married period. All you need is a state official, a witness, and a certificate and you're legally married and can get all of the legal benefits that come with that."
csjf5bp,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"Churches can refuse to marry anyone for any reason.One or both people have the wrong skin color? Church can refuse it. Poor people? Churches can refuse 'em. Pastor doesn't like your face? You bet the church can refuse it.Of course, churches are also allowed to perform marriages that aren't legally binding, including child marriages and plural marriages. Church marriage, by itself, is a ceremony that has no more meaning than the people involved believe it to have. It's the marriage license that makes a marriage powerful, and those can't be refused on arbitrary grounds."
csjf14y,aragorn18,They can still refuse on First Amendment grounds
csjh0u6,mathemagicat,"The US government does not have the power to force religious groups to perform or recognize any marriage, ever, under any conditions. Any attempt to do so would violate the First Amendment. Nobody - not even the most activist of gay activists - is interested in trying to make religious groups marry gay couples against their will. The so-called 'threat to religious freedom' is a lie manufactured by anti-equality activists."

csjfeg4,SimbaOnSteroids,So if two women (or men or other non-male gendered people) got married in Iowa and then moved to Texas. Wouldn't Texas have to recognize their union. I realize that Texas could easily just ignore the 10th amendment until they are ordered otherwise.

States like Texas might try to ignore the ruling or delay implementing it, but there have no legal basis for doing so."

But you have to consider things like how taxes are done, legal recognition, age old processes, protections, and so on... It's much more than just a few places that need changing.

csjgdr8,jeepCK,Very true. Federal law trumps state law.
csjj5zr,TheCoelacanth,"To be more accurate, I would say that is legal, but most states aren't yet in compliance with the law."

We're gonna have some drawn out court battles before that happens. Though to be really accurate we shouldn't be saying ""legal"" at all. This isn't actually an issue of legality. We're just using the term to simplify."

csjetj4,deHavillandDash8Q400,People who make and interpret laws cans do anything defecto. It's all de jure.
csjfo2i,Gregamell,Legalized implies it was illegal. Illegal implies it was a crime. Nowhere was it a crime to get SSM'd (in the US).
csjepd9,prgkmr,"Technically, but functionally it's the same thing, right? In fact, you could say they legalized it by banning the banning of it."
csjf7p4,BSSolo,"Yes, but it's even stronger than that. If congress had simply passed a law legalizing same-sex marriage, a later session could repeal it.Instead, the Supreme Court has decided that no law can ban same-sex marriage, this making it safe from future legislation.Same-sex couples should now be able to breathe a sigh of relief, as it is just a matter of time until individual state bans are challenged and wiped from the books."
csjh0hh,MidnightSlinks,The majority opinion actually said that they *don't* have to wait for legislation and lower courts to align that it should be immediately made legal everywhere because fundamental rights don't have to wait for judicial alignment.

If congress had simply passed a law legalizing same-sex marriage, a later session could repeal it.This.Or states could write laws/ammendments adding restrictions to it. What the SC did instead was to declare that the states could not restrict who was allowed to be married based on gender. It leaves the rest of the protections and definitions in place, but removes the possibility of gender distinctions.This means that any state that tries to change the protections or privileges of marriage has to do them for all marriages, regardless of the gender of the members."
csjmd9u,dan4223,"Short of a constitutional amendment. We came pretty close to that passing around 2004, but it could never happen now."
csjhfwo,orangeandpeavey,"It is possible for a later court to over rule it. I dont think that its very likely in this case, but its possible"
csjtqhr,atomicxblue,"Now we just have to wait for the eventual Constitutional Amendment to be sent to the states. That's the only avenue left for them.I hate, though, when people have come out and said that SCOTUS shouldn't be legislating from the bench. They aren't. They're actually doing their job of providing checks and balances. It's still sad that equality was split right down the middle. It should have been a no brainer."
csjf4ms,neubourn,"Not really, since ""legalizing"" something means codifying it by law, and SCOTUS does not have the authority to make laws, only to decide what is and is not Constitutional."
csjgjcr,Namika,"It's functionality the same thing.Basically, instead of making a law stating ""Everyone must drive an electric car"" they made a judicial ruling of ""The Constitution tells us non-electric cars are not allowed in the U.S... and the Constitution is the Supreme Law of the Land."" The judges didn't pass a new *law* but **functionality** it's the same effect of the population."
csjg90j,Cryptic0677,"Its an important distinction because people against this will call it legislating from the bench, which it is clearly not."
csjenv6,tyw112,"Isn't that effectively the same thing? If you can't ban it then you're legalizing it, right?"
csjes09,aresef,The Supreme Court doesn't make laws. They can rule laws unconstitutional. That's what they did here.
csjfz0k,,"So by ruling those bans unconstitutional, gay marriage is now legal in the the states that held it until now? Is that correct?"
csjg8j7,Frenchie_21,It is illegal to forbid it.
csjotfz,bluetux,or you could say legal to not forbid it
csjhzt1,,"Before states could say ""yes we allow gay marriage"" or ""no we don't allow gay marriage"" and federal government (the supreme court) was okay with whatever.Now states must say ""yes we allow gay marriage,"" or they are breaking the constitution."
csjiyn7,malastare-,"A state can still pass laws and issue executive orders or administrative instructions to refuse to marry same-sex couples.However, they'll be in violation of the Constitution and their actions will be struck down (in quick order, thanks to the clarity of the ruling). Depending on the details of the violation, they may even be sued for their actions.But, you know, they can still try."
csk2pp1,cciv,"They can remove marriage entirely from their state, too. They can just say ""We're no longer in the business of issuing marriage licenses"" or ""We no longer define marriage at all, and marriage will not be a criteria for any services provided by the state"" and be fine. Honestly, that's what SHOULD have happened. The government has no business being in the marriage business. It's a silly thing for people to be fighting over. It's like we're the Sneeches. Instead there should just be relationship contract law and that's it."

csjli3b,GreyMX,"Unless I'm mistaken, the rule that police deliver the Miranda warning is not a law; it's an informal rule that police need to follow if they want to make sure that any testimony given during interrogation is permissible in court. There isn't a *law* saying that police must deliver the Miranda warning, but it's been ruled that it is unconstitutional to use testimony that was extracted during interrogation while the defendant was ignorant of their right to not incriminate themselves and their right to have a lawyer present."
csjneck,bobsp,They don't make statutes but they most certainly make law.
csjnhog,aresef,"No, they don't. They interpret law. They can invalidate laws. But they don't make them. Watch some Schoolhouse Rock or something."
csk53t8,12tb,"Yes, they do. They can't write statutes. But courts make law all the time."
csjfle3,,The supreme court makes laws all the time. We have a common law system.
csjitwq,malastare-,"Unless I was misinformed, the Supreme Court doesn't make laws even under the common law system. They only hear matters on the interpretation of existing laws and rulings. It's the lower courts that do more of the common law creation and application. It's the Supreme Court's job to oversee that, but they don't actively participate.(Lawyers out there, correct me if I'm wrong)"
csjkkty,qwicksilfer,"No you are right. The Supreme Court does not write laws. They can only rule on the constitutionality of existing law.They base their ruling on previous case law.IANAL but I did take civics in high school. Legislative branch *legislates* (writes the law), executive branch *executes the law* (meaning they carry out the law), and the judicial branch sometimes *rules on the law's constitutionality*. No branch does the work for the other branches."
csjzxqx,catchphish,"It's the job of the court to say what the law is, i.e. clarify it. This can include striking down a law as unconstitutional, however the court can do more than just this when interpreting the law, declaring some sort of holding, and letting the executive branch know how to carry out their decisions. See:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison"
csk4qca,12tb,"This is probably what they taught you in your high school civics class, and this certainly gets at the general idea of checks and balances inherent in our system, but this is not how lawmaking works in reality.SCOTUS certainly can't write statutes, but it absolutely can create law. Likewise, the executive branch can't write statutes, but again, it absolutely can create law. Also, SCOTUS can do much, much more than rule on the constitutionality of existing law."
csjlt7n,,"A law is really just an action or rule of the government, and our government attaches the same weight to laws regardless of their origin. When the legislature makes a law, it creates statutory law, when the executive branch makes a law, it creates a regulatory law, and when the judiciary makes a law, it creates common law. Any Supreme Court ruling adds to the common law, because it changes the acts and rules of the government."
csjne25,malastare-,"I'm aware of the definition of the word ""law"". I was specifically addressing whether the Supreme Court takes part in originating laws in a Common Law system.My understanding (and lawyers are free to correct me), is that the Supreme Court does not issue rulings that create common law, technically speaking. Rather, they rule in favor or in opposition to the common law rulings of other courts. It's the state, district, and appellate courts that actually write the judicial common law, and the Supreme Court merely agrees or disagrees. Their rulings are made only on the application of the existing laws or rulings. Being specific, the Supreme Court cannot issue rulings that create new rules or add details into laws or rulings.There is probably some debate here, as it seems Scalia is accusing the SC of doing just that. From the ruling however, all the SC has done is to issue a statement that a previous ruling was incorrect, and that certain types of laws were not constitutional. They have not added new rules or changed any laws. It will be up to the states to rewrite their laws to match the ruling of constitutionality or face the tide of inevitably successful court cases against them citing the opinion of the Supreme Court.It's a thin hair to split, perhaps, but it's sort of important for the judicial system. The Supreme Court has a ton of authority, but their authority is supposed to be limited to just questions on the applicability and constitutionality of laws and rulings from other courts. Actually creating the common law is up to legislatures and other courts."
csk4w5r,12tb,"> Being specific, the Supreme Court cannot issue rulings that create new rules or add details into laws or rulings.I may have covered this in my previous reply (not trying to pile on), but this is not accurate. SCOTUS can, and does, do both of those things. The rest of your post isn't accurate either. I think maybe what you're getting at is that SCOTUS does not have original jurisdiction over the vast majority of cases. That is to say, SCOTUS hears almost every case on appeal from a lower judgment."
csk4kbx,12tb,"Lawyer here. SCOTUS can ""make laws"" as much as any federal court can. But that doesn't happen very often because (1) there isn't a general federal common law (states have much broader common law), and (2) SCOTUS can choose which cases to accept (with a few very minor exceptions). SCOTUS generally chooses to hear only the most important cases, the bulk of which are based on constitutional interpretation. But to say they can't or don't ""make law,"" as you've used that term, isn't correct."
csjgtzq,snarkyTIL,make (something that was previously illegal) permissible by law
csjjg4a,newuser13,This isn't even close to being true.
csjjhuw,rarisgod,So if a law made something illegal.And the SC ruled that law unconstitutional.Then the law would no longer be in place.And the thing that was illegal would be legal.Seems like they legalized it :)
csjjkhe,aresef,"There's a distinction though, between striking down a law and declaring that law and anything resembling it unconstitutional."
csk3z2m,Dinosquid,So it's a nice little thing to throw at your uncle when he's ranting about bullshit! I need every single one of those I can get.

csjg9xw,aresef,"The Supreme Court doesn't always make the right decision, but the Supreme Court is at its best when they follow the moral arc of the universe toward equal justice for all."
csjg9d9,daethcloc,"Everything is legal by default, if they ruled the ban unconstitutional then they have effectively made it legal again. Saying they legalized it is not incorrect as that is the effect that the ruling has."
csjgcif,aresef,"There is a difference, though, between SSM being illegal, SSM being legal but something states may bar and SSM being legal and something states absolutely may not bar."
csjeq6m,snobord,It's a distinction without a difference.
csjf27d,Their_Police,So adding nothing to the conversation really.
csjf7vu,MuleJuiceMcQuaid,Welcome to 90% of Reddit.
csjiaj0,frame_of_mind,I would say it's closer to 95% of reddit.
csjj355,,[deleted]
csjlgqd,Gildenmoth,If it's 92.4999... do you round up to 95% or down to 90%?
csjnz9p,Sandite5,"Well, it's really 10% of us that actually make the difference."
csjg1bt,Tasboo,It adds something in that supreme court decisions set a precedent for years. How the legalization was justified can be just as important as the legalization itself.
csjiebn,dsjunior1388,The difference is huge. It is much stronger in the face of future challenges than a law passed by Congress.
csk4akt,snobord,"Yea, but that's not the topic being discussed. We're just talking about what to call it (""legalized"" vs ""can't ban""). What you're referring to goes to who made the decision and that's not what I'm discussing."
csjjrte,welliamwallace,There IS a difference. Legalizing it (passing a law) would mean that it could later be made illegal again by a simple majority in Congress. The Supreme Court decision instead made all laws banning it unconstitutional. Now it would require a constitutional amendment to make it illegal again. BIG difference.
csk4738,snobord,"Yes, but that's not the distinction I was referring to and I don't believe that's what the people that commented above me were referring to either. In this case, it doesn't matter if you call it the court legalizing same sex marriage or if you call it the court said you can't ban same sex marriage. The two phrases are technically distinct but they're functionally the same. In other words, I'm just talking about what you call it, not who decided it."
csjf4ar,vmedhe2,The Best kind of Distinction!
csjjfwt,Ibeadoctor,I love that phrase
csjjtdj,PhilosophicalBrewer,"> Yes, but it's even stronger than that. If congress had simply passed a law legalizing same-sex marriage, a later session could repeal it.> Instead, the Supreme Court has decided that no law can ban same-sex marriage, this making it safe from future legislation.Subtle but distinct and noteworthy."
csjgp9w,ChornWork2,It's really more of a difference that's only a distinction.
csjgf0g,Anonymous709,The best kind of distinction.
csjjpjx,conman16x,My favorite logical fallacy of all!
csjezcr,MaxCHEATER64,"Yes and no. It's more profound than a simple legalization.Let me explain.So let's say congress passes law X. Great! Later, however, they can just repeal Law X, or include a repeal of X in Law Y. Then later they can repeal Law Y and re-pass Law X.Now let's say congress passes law X, and the supreme court says that Law X is unconstitutional. In order for Law X to be re-passed, congress would have to pass a constitutional amendment that specifically overrides the court's decision. THAT requires a supermajority in congress and the approval of most of the states - which hasn't happened since the 90s (and that amendment took two hundred years to pass!).In other words, congress doesn't really have the ability to override the court's decision, which they *would* have if they had legalized marriage through a law. So instead of same-sex marriage becoming legal, same-sex marriage is now unable to be made illegal, which is a much stronger situation for the law."
csjewmw,IntotheWIldcat,"Effectively yes, but the difference in phrasing is to show the purpose of the SCOTUS. They don't write laws, they decide whether or not something is constitutional."
csjet7g,FullClockworkOddessy,"Each individual ban still has yet to be taken off the books, but that's just a matter of legal logistics than anything. Now that they're deemed unconstitutional they'll be out of the books before sundown."
csjf1nw,xHeero,>Now that they're deemed unconstitutional they'll be out of the books before sundown.You'd be surprised at how often language like that stays on the books. Sometimes it is easier to just leave it on the books rather than go through the process of amending laws. The language is already completely invalidated by the supreme court ruling.
csjhq6b,Dolurn,Didn't it take 30 years for Alabama to take the interracial marriage ban off the books?
csji2cw,xHeero,And didn't they perform interracial marriages the entire time it was still on the books because the supreme court ruling invalidated the language banning interracial marriage?
csjic52,Dolurn,"Yes, they did have to perform interracial marriages. It was just a case of it still being on the books for a long time after SCOTUS ruled the bans unconstitutional."
csjilcy,xHeero,"My point is that it literally doesn't matter that the law is ""on the books"" if it is ruled unconstitutional."
csjiv6u,Dolurn,"Oh I know, I was just giving an example of that."
csjg7gq,markevens,"The ruling states that this is in effect immediately, in all states. It doesn't matter what is on the books, the books are overruled and same sex marriage licenses shall be granted without delay."
csjexec,caskey,You need a license to get married. By not issuing a license in certain circumstances you can achieve a ban in practice.Think about the attempts to have things like literacy tests for voting. This was done to prevent uneducated black Americans from voting in the south.
csjjiwk,,[deleted]
csjsuv8,caskey,This is exactly that kind of thing.
csjf0xs,RollerRagerMD,I'd suppose legalizing it means writing into law that gay marriages can be performed. This is more of a binding decision that outlaws bans on marriage on the basis of sexual orientation. It makes it so you can't write a law saying gays can't get married.
csjf3y5,,"Well, it also means that if Conservatives come into power and want to make it illegal again, the Constitution is saying that it's unconstitutional to ban it, meaning that if they wanted to take it away, they'd have to step on the Constitution."
csjf5sa,hungryhungryME,"They didn't *not* un-legalize it, if that makes more sense."
csjf671,Telre,"It's an incredibly important distinction. If I legalize something that means there is a document that says exactly how something can be done legally. The best example I can think of is driving a car. It is legalized in the sense that I have a certain set of rules that if I follow I can use a car on a public road. If I break those rules the government has different punishments/penalties that can be assessed.It would be very concerning if someone (regardless of your stance on this particular issue) could be punished because they did not follow a particular set of rules in their marriage, or ceremony. In my opinion this is the difference between myself and people who tend to be more ""left"" then me. I don't particularly care about gay marriage being legal in the sense of people being allowed to. I don't particularly like that people want to go beyond allowing it to forcing people to take part in it (bakeries etc.)"
csjkqpa,Sabuleon,"If you don't mind my asking, how is it ""forcing"" a bakery to participate when they bake an item that will be used in a ""disagreeable"" ceremony, but the bakers themselves don't have to participate in the ceremony?It just doesn't make sense to me, seems to be taking ideology way too far.What if the bakers weren't told what the cake is for in the first place, does that make any difference?"
csnm4st,Telre,"The inverse of your question is where the problem becomes evident. What if I do know what the cake is for?What if the cake is for an anti-gay wedding protest and I disagree? What if the cake is for a KKK rally?I wouldn't want a cake I baked used for a KKK rally. How is it equal protection under the law if I can discriminate against one group, but not another?You force my participation by penalizing my inaction."
csnuzmi,Sabuleon,"Is there a law that will penalize you by selling a cake to someone *when you don't know* they're the KKK?!?The example you just gave shows how you might as well stay out of business entirely, because who knows where your sold goods go. Wal-Mart probably sells clothes to murderers! OMG!...(Your example is invalid.)"
cso15wc,Telre,"I'm not sure your point here. My example was never about lack of knowledge. I may not have been clear and I apologize. I was referencing (my) discrimination against the KKK themselves, by refusing to do business with them. If I refuse to bake a cake for a KKK rally, if we truly apply the law equally I am guilty of discrimination.There are cases of people being sued for knowledge of who they were baking for, and refusing based on that knowledge.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/21/denver-bakery-anti-gay-cake-_n_6516674.htmlTo your wal-mart statement; It is illegal for me discriminate against murders. Being a felon is considered a protected class. Being a felon (murderer) is considered a disparate effect, and my refusal to do business with a murderer can be punished by current law. I guess I don't quite get were either of us are relevant to the actual arguments being made here.I also, perhaps mistakenly, see a difference between an item on the shelf (wal-mart) and the creation of a new item (a bakery).Edit: I guess I should try to respond to your example which is about lack of knowledge. Texas housing v. inclusive communities, a different, recent, supreme court ruling creates the type of situation you are using as an example trying to discredit by stance as somehow extreme. Texas housing v. inclusive communities, uses the legal reasoning that disparate effects or impacts are legally actionable. The ""new"" part of this ruling says that you no longer need to be aware of your discrimination for it to be a legally actionable offense. Getting to the point we've created a really bizarre set of legal precedents that people like because it aids there goals (legalization of gay marriage) but has very concerning effects to the legal system. For instance, what should be the ability for me to be sued if I refuse to do business with the KKK knowingly or unknowingly."
csjf674,JonnyLay,You're legalizing it in all the places that banned it. The places that never banned it would still have to legalize it. I think...ianal
csjf89t,Shy_Guy_1919,"Effectively yes, but phased in a way that would coincide with the 14th amendment."
csjfcnz,Bunnymancer,"No, that means it's a given right to begin with.Same way we can't legalize access air or, as duly noted, the right to love.Legalizing something is a process that includes the option to revert it, or override the legalization with corner cases etc. etc.Also any constitution can override legalization.By stating it can't be banned, it is a right and not just ""allowed"""
csjfk7m,,"Well they can't force churches/ministers to marry gay people, and many will continue to not do so as they have every right to"
csjfm0f,thingandstuff,"What's lost in translation is the way our laws and government actually work.The powers of the federal government and the states are for the most part, very clearly enumerated, and legislation is no just as simple as ""do it because most people want it"" in many cases.This is the hang up with things like the second amendment. Even if most people want to ban guns, the government has no authority to do so. A constitutional convention would need to be convened and an amendment made."
csji652,SuperArff,It's sort of like how some states still ban sodomy but can't actually enforce those laws because they were ruled unconstitutional.
csjjtj7,Banshee90,Well amendments can be repealed. Thus if enough anti gay representation gets in Congress they can make an amendment to nolify it
csjk0mf,Givemeawayoutofhere,Sorta. But it's even better than writing a law declaring it legal.
csjmsns,hyperfat,"You can't ban them and you have to recognise someone who is married anywhere in the states regardless of sex, however probate judges could decide they no longer want to issue any marriege lisenses. Basically they could make it really difficult to get a lisense or signature signed if they really were dastardly enough."
csjuyyx,tipsana,"The point is that no entity can *give* you a fundamental right; you already possess it. Instead, the decision orders the states to stop denying you the exercise of that right that you already possess."
csk03ld,falconear,"Yes but it's an importantly distinction. The justices aren't ""legislating from the bench"", they're fulfilling their constitutional role by striking down unconstitutional bans on gay marriage. The result is the same, but this is far better argument to use against butthurt right wingers. :)"
csjfr20,Echelon64,"> Isn't that effectively the same thing?Nope. The distinction means the Supreme Court muzzled the government. The Supreme Court doesn't give rights. It's the whole basis of the US Constitution. By muzzling the government you just told them this is one area you can't fuck with, period. The distinction also serves as another point to the hypocrisy of so-called ""small government"" Republicans."
csjegev,EagleSkyline,"Thanks for that distinction, since headlines and reddit posts tend to gravitate toward the more clickable phrases despite their inaccuracies."
csjeovj,AmericanOSX,"There's not really a distinction. Several states had made it illegal through state constitutional amendments. The Court just said ""Sorry, but you can't do that."""
csjf37n,SirensToGo,"So the headline should be ""SCOTUS bans bans on same-sex marriage"""
csjg14e,TheHumbleSailor,But isn't a ban on a ban a legalization? It's like two negatives make a positive yaknow
csjgilx,overzealous_dentist,"Not explicitly... it's like humming a song. There's no ban on humming a song, but it's not explicitly legalized, either."
csjgw51,TheHumbleSailor,"Never thought of it like that. I'm sure people could think up a whole host of ""not illegal but not legal"" things like I dunno helicopter jousting or something"
csji9wn,narp7,"That's not a good comparison, because we could make that specific act illegal if we wanted to, which we can't do with gay marriage. Also, it probably is already illegal as I'm sure it would violate FAA regulations."
csjioed,TheHumbleSailor,Good point good point
csjh722,overzealous_dentist,"Jesus Christ, I'm just envisioning that..."
csjn35q,ILieConstantly,"This is kind of a weird conversation to me. Aren't laws, by their nature, something that makes something illegal rather than the other way around? So isn't saying something is legalized just the equivalent of saying that there is no law against it?"
csjn6cd,overzealous_dentist,"Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought ""legalize"" meant make explicit that something was permissable, despite other laws that could otherwise infringe. I'm thinking of the Colorado law on marijuana, for example, which explicitly says recreational use is fine, overrulling other laws that say it's not."
csk2jtd,ILieConstantly,"So I've been thinking about it even more, and I think you could point to two examples in your favor, but I still don't think they quite work.In the case of Colorado, I think those laws exist in the way they do because the essentialy defy Federal law. They can't overrule a Federal law technically, so they've more or less passed a law saying that they will defy federal law and regulate the sale of pot. Not that I'm against legalization, but that's just how it works, you don't get to override the federal government as a state or local entity.The other one would be the bill of rights, but even then the bill of rights doesn't exactly make something legal, it just affirms a right that was thought to exist anyway and prohibits another law from infringing upon it.So, yeah, I stand by the previous assessment that technically nothing is actually written into law as illegal, but rather that the law is a process of restriction - basically if it isn't in the law or part of common law it's generally assumed to be legal.Hence, I think it's fully justified to say that the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage by striking down all laws preventing it."
csjgseo,delkarnu,"""United States makes gay marriage legal by passing the 14th Amendment to the Constitution"" - July 9, 1868"
csjfiii,GreanEcsitSine,"Or a much more readable format would be ""SCOTUS bans same-sex marriage bans."""
csjfniy,EagleSkyline,Exactly. The OP headline almost implies that gay marriage was federally illegal.
csjgcq4,animatedhockeyfan,"Which is the exact same thing as saying ""same sex marriage is legal"""
csjgopd,LanMarkx,"Next up, bans on bans on Fracking!"
csjgtzt,SplitReality,In this case the double negative is like a [double rainbow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI).
csji1ga,goodbetterbestbested,"No, because it also applies to the states without bans on SSM that were in circuits that had issued rulings stating that SSM wasn't a fundamental right. These states still didn't have SSM."
csji9wb,KalAl,"No it shouldn't, because there's no practical difference and that sentence is clumsy as fuck."
csjf4wj,flamingdonkey,"So gay marriage hasn't been legalized, but banning gay marriage has been made illegal?"
csjfb2c,AmericanOSX,"Yeah, basically. The 14th Amendment says *No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.*That's why a state can't just decide to enact a law (even by a popular vote or ballot measure) to do something like take away women's right to vote or reinstitute slavery. The court said that same sex marriage bans are a violation of the 14th Amendment, and thus, illegal. The US Constitution trumps State Constitutions."
csjg5kj,xHeero,"They also define marriage as a fundamental right....states can't just outlaw marriage in it's entirety either. Since states are required to allow people marriage, and they cannot deny it to same sex couples, this ruling literally legalized same sex marriage in all 50 states."
csjfcds,beelzeflub,"YOU, CAN'T, DO, THAT! *clap clap clspclapclap*"
csjg3pt,xHeero,"They went beyond that and they basically say that marriage is a fundamental right and it is unconstitutional to deny that right to same sex couples.Since states cannot deny it's population of a fundamental right, states cannot outlaw marriage in it's entirety. Also, the court ruled that the 14th amendment says that same sex couples cannot be denied the right to marriage.The supreme court just de facto legalized same sex marriage in all 50 states."
csjinmp,AbstractLogic,If they can't make it illegal then there is no need to make it legal either I presume?
csjlxra,curiousbooty,"Wait, will states be able to put limitations on it without banning it? Kinda like the poll taxes and grandfather clauses from the civil rights era?"
csjepnh,analogkid01,"I think the *effect* is the same, though - we don't need to puff ourselves up by our intimate knowledge of legalese to be happy about this decision and its consequences."
csjgbnm,Palewisconsinite,But being pedantic is what the internet is *for*.
csjizto,alanaa92,It's important to our legal system that the Supreme Court didn't suddenly begin passing laws - something it has no right to do.
csjj3g6,analogkid01,And...it hasn't. Carry on.
csjeow2,aresef,I work for a media outlet. Our full-blast email from corporate had basically the same subject line as OP
csjf6a9,,"No, the reddit post is essentially right. The only difference is how it's worded. It wasn't legalized, but you can't now make it illegal by state law. AKA every state in which it was illegal to get gay married, it is now legal. It is the same thing."
csjfqiv,domoarigatodrloboto,"It's just a question of semantics. Yes, technically gay marriage was always legal, but several states had taken action to ban it, and the Court reversed those decisions.In other words, the Court made a decision that resulted in gay marriage being recognized as legal. To claim that they didn't legalize it is to split hairs to a ridiculous degree."
csjfs24,,It's still the same. Gay marriage was legalized b/c the Supreme court said the ban was unconstitutional. It clears confusion and still remains accurate.
csjg2hy,walruz,"There were placed in the US where you couldn't get gay married yesterday. There are no such places today. Hence, the supreme court made gay marriage legal in those places."
csjf0v4,HydroLeakage,I just pray to Based God that we never have to hear about Gay Marriage in a political campaign.
csjf32i,aresef,"In a weird way, this benefits Republicans because it takes the issue off the table for them."
csjf6d7,HydroLeakage,"Its a win for everyone. I am ecstatic. I personally think that the homosexuals have a character flaw but i'm happy that I don't have to hear about the bullshit associated with them. I just hope they don't start SUE crazy when some guys says ""I DON'T MARRY FAGS CUZ I DONT BELIEVE IN THAT SHIT"" because they have the right to do that as well."
csjf98w,aresef,They don't have a character flaw. They are people like you and me just trying to live their lives and have their loving relationships recognized by the law the same as any other two consenting adults.
csjfvvw,HydroLeakage,"I understand everything, except the first sentence. Morbidly Obese people are people just like you and I who should be recognized by the law, but they still have a character flaw. Most people have character flaws, including myself."
csjfy7p,aresef,"But homosexuality is not a character flaw. If it is, then being black is a character flaw. Being a woman or being disabled is a character flaw."
csjg9a8,HydroLeakage,"No, these things are tangible, being gay isn't tangible. There is an emotional or chemical imbalance in the brain to want to be with the same gender. I believe the categorization of what is and what isn't an act of being gay mentally effects individuals to the point where there is no gray area. Men and born to be intimate with women. It's Human Nature. No society can survive in an 100% LGBT mode."
csjgdlw,aresef,Being gay isn't a mental illness or an illness of any kind.
csjgkzx,HydroLeakage,"I never said it was an mental illness, I said it was a character flaw. ""character flaw is a limitation, imperfection, problem, phobia, or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional.""From a fundamental standpoint, men should be with women, because that is how communities form. From population growth. There are many straight people fucked up in the head, but the LGBT community is not natural. On top of this statistics shows that there is an imbalance as they have a much higher suicide rate. ""• LGB youth are 4 times more likely, and questioning youth are 3 times more likely, to attempt suicide as their straight peers. [2]""Are you going to say that these people are tortured into it? If so, who the fuck cares what other people think of you? Logic and statistics are wonderful."
csjeqyb,Redtyuw,"No they ruled that the Constitution provides a right to it, and therefore it is now legal. They did legalize it. Not through a legislative process, but through the judicial process that is so essential in common law.Edit: my point being they made gay marriage legal and a right. How is that not ""legalizing"" it?"
csjfgsm,marmosetohmarmoset,Right.From SCOTUSblog:>Holding: Fourteenth Amendment requires a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex.Seems like they are not just saying you can't ban same sex marriage. They are say states are *required* to allow SSM.
csjepyn,yogiwhiskey,[What this could mean](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/06/25/417112332/heres-how-the-supreme-court-could-rule-today-on-same-sex-marriage)
csjes0o,DeviouSherbert,"So, what does that mean exactly? Will states with a ban on gay marriage be forced to lift the ban? Thanks for this clarification!"
csjetbo,aresef,It means those bans are unenforceable and dead already.
csjf6vt,neubourn,"> Will states with a ban on gay marriage be forced to lift the ban?Correct. SCOTUS decided that such bans are Unconstitutional, and that is the death knell for any such law. Constitution is our Supreme Law of the Land."
csjfney,eliminate1337,Same thing that happened when the laws against 'sodomy' were reversed. They're now unenforceable even if they're still on the books.
csjev5f,Lato87,They de-illegalized it? Good enough for me.
csjf1yo,MattHoppe1,Haven't seen you without an Orioles flair lmao
csjj7m1,cptcliche,I've seen him with Ravens and Towson flairs. But the point still stands.
csjeohn,SirP3rry,"So I'm not sure what exactly that means, is it better than legalization?"
csjerj0,aresef,"Yeah. The Supreme Court does not make laws. They interpret the laws and say whether or not they are constitutional. Today, they ruled that any same-sex marriage bans anywhere are unconstitutional. They ruled that any law (including the last vestiges of DOMA) barring the recognition or allowing states to bar the recognition of marriages from other states is unconstitutional. This is tremendous precedent."
csjexd0,mostirrelephant,"Especially considering that any attempt to circumvent this decision through legislative means would require a constitutional amendment, a virtual impossibility."
csjezyp,aresef,Exactly. Republicans are gonna have a bad time with that.
csjf2v1,neubourn,"The Supreme court has no authority to pass laws, that power resides with Congress and individual states. SCOTUS has the power to determine what is and is not Constitutional (protected by the Constitution), and this decision has the effect of preventing any state from banning Same Sex marriages, on the grounds that any such ban would be Unconstitutional. And since states also have to recognize same-sex marriages from other states, it will not be long before they have to approve them in their own states as well."
csjf3dg,B4SSF4C3,"Yes, because legalization implies that we may have viewed something as illegal in the first place, something worth prohibiting. I take this decision to mean that the right to marry is so fundemental that no one can even consider putting any legislation in place to impede it. In effect, the same. From an ethical perspective however its a more powerful message.Also, as others have mentioned, it is a stronger legal stance. A law requires only a majority to repeal or pass. To overrule a consitutional ruling, an amendment would be required, which is infinitely more difficult to pass. With our current two-party split, that translates into: never gonna happen."
csjj81n,Blindweaponsfumbler,"This is an important distinction, if the court is making laws I want a revolution, if the courts saying certain laws are unconstitutional the system works."
csjepjr,,So how soon can same sex couples get married? Does that mean soon same sex couples can get married in any state without having to legalize it (pass on a ballot) since it's unconstitutional to ban it?
csjevar,aresef,As soon as hours or days. Soon as the forms can be drawn up.Yes.
csjfoq7,eliminate1337,Yes. Ballots on the issue are now unnecessary and only symbolic if they're carried out.
csjer03,iamPause,[Serious] What's the difference?
csjeu7j,aresef,"The Supreme Court cannot make and pass laws. Federal and state legislators do. The Supreme Court, presented with a lower court case, can rule such laws unconstitutional."
csjew6f,iamPause,"So it's sort of like a double negative? They are saying that you can't ban it (gay marriage), which makes it so that you have to allow it (which infers that it is legal). Am I understanding this correctly?"
csjf254,aresef,They didn't just overturn every same-sex marriage ban. They ruled that nobody can ever institute such ban ever. The only people that can make it legal again are Congress and the states amending the U.S. Constitution (lol no) or the Supreme Court going back to this years from now. Either one would be a travesty.
csjfci9,NedDasty,"Yes. Everything is semantics and people are trying to show off, but they mean the exact same thing. Logically we are talking about the two cases:* You are allowed to do X* You cannot be prevented from doing XThe only difference is that individual laws still exist that now have been declared unconstitutional. There is thus still some easily surmounted red tape whereby each of those laws must be formally revoked."
csjfc7l,neubourn,"Once you get down to the nuts and bolts, you still have to have a proper framework of laws that codify what it is the state or country is going to do. Lets say you want to get a good ol fashioned heterosexual marriage right now, you cant just up and do it on a whim, you have to go to someone who has the authority from the state to grant you a marriage license, and can legally wed you. You must go through this process for your marriage to be recognized by the state. SCOTUS has no power over any of that, it will still come down to the states to put a framework in place for this by passing actual laws to make it ""legal"" to marry. What SCOTUS has done is declare bans on it Unconstitutional, which means states will, in effect, have to come up with a proper framework of laws to move this forward, since they are prevented from doing the opposite, they cant prevent homosexuals from getting married in their state if that is their decision."
csjevy5,harpyson11,"None. In fact, this is from scotus blog, that is now live blogging the event.> Fourteenth Amendment requires a state to license a marriage between two people of the same sex."
csjetd8,,[deleted]
csjeykv,aresef,"What happens next is that all same-sex marriage bans at the state level can no longer be enforced, and all states must recognize such marriages performed in other states. The Defense of Marriage Act allowed states to ban recognition of same-sex marriages, in clear contraditiction of a clause in the Constitution that requires states to give ""full faith and credit"" to public acts of other states, such as driver's licenses and marriage certificates."
csjetfz,,[deleted]
csjew9y,aresef,It's *unconstitutional* to ban it.
csjetk7,,So it means that you can't stop same sex marriages? What's the difference between that and legalized?
csjetlp,Atheose_Writing,Not quite true. From the brief:> Held: The Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to license a marriage between two people of the same sex and to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-State. Pp. 3–28.
csjexfm,,"As usual, I encourage people to read dissenting Supreme Court opinions. [Today's was written by Roberts](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf).Regardless how you feel about gay marriage, there's nothing in the 14th amendment about it. As Roberts wrote:> In short, our Constitution does not enact any one theory of marriage.Which is true. Under the Constitution, it would be left up to the states to define marriage...so, as with so many things, it should really be a state-by-state issue, by how the Constitution is written.> 'If you are among the many Americans--of whatever sexual orientation--who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today's decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not Celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it'I don't have a particular horse in this race, but as usual with this court, the decision amounts to legislating from the bench. We have a founding document that says ""here are the following rules...and whatever this Constitution doesn't cover is left to the states."" Gay marriage is obviously not covered, nor ever addressed. If you want gay marriage to be constitutional nationwide, you have to either 1) make it an amendment or 2) find 5 justices on the Supreme Court who want gay marriage more than they want it to be constitutional."
csjezfp,aresef,Loving v. Virginia
csjf8hj,,What about it?
csjfd3x,aresef,"Warren's opinion is clear precedent here. Emphasis mine>These statutes also deprive the Lovings of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. **The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.**>Marriage is one of the ""basic civil rights of man,"" fundamental to our very existence and survival. Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535, 541 (1942). See also Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190 (1888). To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law. **The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discriminations. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.**https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/388/1#writing-USSC_CR_0388_0001_ZO"
csjfkfp,,"Not really. From the Roberts dissent:> In Loving, the Court held that racial restrictions on the right to marry lacked a compelling justification. In Zablocki, restrictions based on child support debts did not suffice. In Turner, restrictions based on status as a prisoner were deemed impermissible.> None of the laws at issue in those cases purported to change the core definition of marriage as the union of a man and a woman....> Removing racial barriers to marriage therefore did not change what a marriage was any more than integrating schools changed what a school was.Or, in short: > These precedents say nothing at all about a right to make a State change its definition of marriage, which is the right petitioners actually seek here.If you want gay marriage in the Constitution, put it there. It is not in there, so it should be left to the states, as has been the case until today."
csjfn4l,aresef,The dissent does not carry the day.
csjfoik,,"No, but the dissent is correct in this case."
csjfpe4,aresef,It's not morally correct. It's not legally correct. It's not constitutionally correct. And it's not the law of the land.
csjfreq,,"> It's not morally correct.Obviously, that's a different debate.> It's not legally correct. It's not constitutionally correct. It absolutely is, on both counts, for the reasons already stated.> And it's not the law of the land.Again, I don't dispute this."
csjfy09,Blain,"> the core definition of marriage as the union of a man and a woman.There is no 'core definition of marriage' in the Constitution, though. How can Roberts say ""our Constitution does not enact any one theory of marriage,"" while at the same time basing his argument off a ""core definition of marriage"" that does not exist in the document he is supposed to be making his decisions from? The two statements are directly contradictory."
csjg24h,,"> There is no 'core definition of marriage' in the Constitution, though.Agreed, and I roll my eyes when Roberts talks about *overturning a long-held institution*. It's not relevant.But what's not in the Constitution is left (by the Constitution) for the states to define, as has been the case thus far."
csjg4n1,Blain,"Well, regarding /u/aresef's post, before Loving certain states ""defined"" marriage as the union of a man and a woman who shared the same race. The Supreme Court changed that definition. There is certainly precedent for a decision like this one."
csjeyfp,idiotsonfire,"If bans on gay marriage are illegal, and so are bans on recognizing it, then it is, in fact, legal for gay people to get married and illegal to deny their marriages."
csjezo4,jonlucc,Good point. Any analysis of if this leaves some path for particularly stubborn states from wiggling through some other obstruction?
csjf4dm,aresef,No. It doesn't.https://twitter.com/ditzkoff/status/614435698402267136
csjft1c,jonlucc,Thank you.
csjezxm,RockAutomatic,"> They didn't legalize it.they established its legality, which means exactly the same thing. from the opinion: ""Since same-sex couples may now exercise the fundamental right to marry in all States, there is no lawful basis for a State to refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex character.""important bits: ""same-sex couples may now exercise the fundamental right to marry in all States"""
csjf111,ASK-IF-I-AM-PAULRUDD,So states can't 'un legalize' it? I don't really understand the difference?
csjf3gk,tonterias,"So what does it mean? Anyone in any state can marry whoever they want now? Or needs something else?I am not from USA, no idea how it works there"
csjf665,aresef,The right to marry shall not be abridged based on the gender or sex of the individuals who which to exercise it.
csjf8gh,tonterias,"Yes, but is it immediate? Or needs something else?In any state? Or some can invent something up?"
csjfa4o,aresef,"It's immediate. In every single state, territory, protectorate or possession."
csjf46a,,"In other words, the states can either allow gay marriage or not allow any marriages at all."
csjf6hi,utvgjy6gy54v,"Wait so, are we done here?

csjf87d,aresef,Yes. This is it.
csjf9h6,Bunnymancer,I've been asking for the last year or so why we keep doing it by state and not just blanket fix it.Seems this was what we were looking for.
csjfc6d,intlorange,It was not legal where I live. Now it is. Sounds like legalization to me.
csjfdvk,aresef,More like the law or amendment banning it where you are is unconstitutional and is never ever coming back.
csjfcpx,moleratical,"semantics, states had made gay marriage illegal, the supreme court said the states can't do that, therefore it is no longer illegal; thus it is legal."
csjfi4c,PRbox,"As someone who doesn't understand all this, does this mean that every state in the USA now must allow gay couples to marry? So it's basically legalized in all 50 states?"
csjfocc,aresef,Yes. Yes. And any bans that did exist no longer do.
csjfiz6,thingandstuff,"The 14th amendment seems to be inclusive of rights, how could someone spin that around and say that it gives the government power to ban gay marriages?"
csjfntk,aresef,Because SCOTUS had not yet ruled that they couldn't.
csjg03x,thingandstuff,"Obviously, I guess I'm just curious how someone could think the 14th could be used to deny people rights; I'm curious what the legal reasoning was in the state law that was struck down by this decision."
csjg1qb,aresef,Nobody was thinking about the 14th when they were passing same-sex marriage bans on the state level and barring recognition on the federal level.
csjg8um,thingandstuff,"Oh, I must have misread something."
csjfplp,Meapalien,I edit old comments
csjfpwi,aresef,Marriage bans
csjfq3l,,Does that mean same sex unions are federally recognised?
csjfzj5,aresef,They already were under United States v. Windsor. This ruling requires *states* to both recognize and license same-sex marriages. The only federal law it takes out is the last standing part of DOMA.
csjfsg3,thegreenpizza,"Well this is in line with the purpose of SCOTUS. They don't make laws, they rule that laws are constitutional or not, therefore setting precedence. They sort of set laws on future laws by analyzing current laws. This is the most important check of power in our government, I think."
csjfsga,moonsweetie4u,Serious: What is the difference?
csjfxcs,aresef,Laws are temporary. Supreme Court rulings on what the Constitution allows are as close to permanent as anything gets.
csjgnw5,,">Scalia called the decision a “threat to American democracy,” saying it was “constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine.”Justice Scalia learned how the Supreme Court is supposed to work."
csji0db,Geohump,"Right, like the exact same thing didn't happen with the ""Citizens United"" decision. Scalia is a huge hypocrite."
csjpg0c,_rough23,"It didn't, though, because the Citizens United decision was completely in line with dozens of previous major cases that reached the Supreme Court decades ago. Most people don't understand anything about the decision, but all you really have to do is read the Wikipedia article for it:> This ruling was frequently characterized as permitting corporations and unions to donate to political campaigns, or as removing limits on how much a donor can contribute to a campaign. However, these claims are incorrect, as the ruling did not affect the 1907 Tillman Act's ban on corporate campaign donations (as the Court noted explicitly in its decision), nor the prohibition on foreign corporate donations to American campaigns, nor did it concern campaign contribution limits. The Citizens United decision did not disturb prohibitions on corporate contributions to candidates, and it did not address whether the government could regulate contributions to groups that make independent expenditures. The Citizens United ruling did however remove the previous ban on corporations and organizations using their treasury funds for direct advocacy. These groups were freed to expressly endorse or call to vote for or against specific candidates, actions that were previously prohibited.You have to understand that the only thing Citizens United addressed was whether an organization could, on its own, speak in favor (or opposition) of a candidate to office. Corporations are not just for-profit organizations, they can be unions, they can be advocacy organizations. Citizens United was one of those. The law overturned by Citizens United prohibited non-profits from speaking about a candidate (with arbitrary exceptions for ""media"" companies which held no ground in constitutional law). The First Amendment makes very, very broad speech protections available.This does go to show, though, that every side will use the ""judicial activism"" defense to win points. Scalia today was no different."
csjvgsl,HowAboutShutUp,Scalia so salty he make the soy sauce think its maple syrup.

csk8aqz,kmg90,Reddit doesn't attract the crazy far right...
csjr3ud,subjectivism,"All the conservative commentary about the decision's ""legal reasoning"" (mostly from non-lawyers) is really annoying. Yes, ideally, there should have been a bill to declare same sex marriage legal throughout the U.S. but clearly, that wasn't happening so some activist judges stepped in. Is it the judiciary's role to make law? No, it is not. But is it reasonable to wait another decade of lawsuits and political games to make it happen? Fuck no."
csk6v1b,maintain_composure,"While it's thoughtful of you to say that getting all the legal ducks in a row wasn't as important as getting same-sex marriage legalized, the legal justification for this decision is quite solid. Restricting access to a basic human right, which the Court long ago decided marriage was, must demonstrably serve some legitimate government interest; so goes the ""rational basis review"" used for issues of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The court decided that restricting access to marriage based on the gender of partners involved served no legitimate government interest, so it was completely justified for them to strike it down. Not activism -- just solid Constitutional law."
csk7ljl,subjectivism,"I think judicial activism is legally justified in many situations. It's still not the ""ideal"" way for this to have gone down (i.e. through legislative amendments) but in righting a historical wrong, it's pretty rich for critics to say that it wasn't done the perfect way. What would be truly perfect is if same sex marriage was always allowed in the first place!"
csl247s,maintain_composure,"I don't actually see why legislative amendment would have been ideal. California, where I'm from, adds state amendments at the drop of a hat, practically, so they're not exactly the strongest statements about equality, and making a new amendment to the U.S. Constitution just to legalize a new form of marriage would be ridiculous. Doing it through the Supreme Court *is* effectively saying that gay marriage is not only legal now but also *has* been legal ever since the 14th Amendment was made. It's a way of saying that the right has been there for over a hundred years already and thus it's not something that states can give or take away as they please."
csll0pu,subjectivism,"That's true, I never thought of it that way. Theoretically, an amendment made by elected officials is the most democratic way to effect change. Of course, true democracy has been a bit of a question mark lately."

csjn7l6,fauxhee,"They made him look wishy-washy, yes. But he managed to be out of touch with most of America on his own."
csjof43,awdasdaafawda,He was simply too stupid and out of touch to be President. He made G.W. Bush look like a genius.
csjosa3,jca2u,That's definitely what happened to McCain. He used to be a very moderate republican that many people in the left (including me) were quite fond of. You cant run for president as a republican without catering to the crazy right.
csjtdh5,Avant_guardian1,Moderate like taking the right to vote away from the poor and working class people?
csjufxo,Frommerman,"The man is a snake. He will say whatever is popular in order to gain power, and I am not convinced he has any opinions that are his own except, ironically, his Mormon - induced homophobia. He was blocking a lot of people from getting married."
csjwkn2,Asspenniesforyou,Same with McCain.
csjxt7u,Love_Bulletz,His Netflix documentary was really cool. I feel bad for the guy.
csk2fa3,TyceGN,I agree. Fiscally conservative and socially moderately conservative. Actually cared about health care too.
csjgvd3,ATXBeermaker,They didn't make him do it. He did it by choice to try to get what he wanted.
csjgzja,jvorn,"True, but it's the presidency. People have compromised their ideals for much, much less. I think he was thinking he could stoop to the crazies of the GOP's level to get elected and then me himself once in office."
csjlpyw,bgarza18,"There's still Rand Paul if he doesn't run third party, he probably wouldn't have trouble letting certain social issues be."
csjluxj,Jay_Train,"I'm sorry, but even if he WAS more moderate, I can't in conscious vote for ANYONE who believes their magic underpants will save them from nuclear annihilation. Don't want that guys finger on the button."
csjhkh1,Xibby,"> toe the party line.Main problem with the current GOP. Toe the party line or you get declared a RINO, and the party line is being set by Tea Party and religious fundamentalists/extremists. There is little room for things like compromise and personal belief."
csjhp14,jvorn,"Yup. Makes me quite sad as I would vote for the GOP 10/10 times if it was the real GOP: smaller government (where it's reasonable, government has to be strong is some areas to keep large corps from running amok) and fiscal responsibility."
csjf1tq,EmAreDubs,"Why don't Republican candidates just ignore the people who are so backwards on social issues? I mean, it's not like those people are suddenly going to vote Democrat."
csjf69p,CaptainCAPSLOCKED,"Because older people believe their votes matter. Which makes them vote more. Which makes their opinions heavier than young people who don't believe their votes matter.If the Republican party ignored their crazies, they would either vote less, or support a third party candidate, effectively giving the presidency to the Democrats."
csjhenq,eeeezypeezy,"At this point I think they need to start ignoring the crazies and accept a time out of power while they retool and come back stronger, with a more focused platform and a broader base. Like a baseball team taking a couple of years ""off"" to develop their farm talent."
csjhgkp,,"I'm concerned that anyone who isn't a LEftist and doesn't believe in your social values is commonly referred to as ""Crazies""This kind of marginalization is what creates radicals in the first place.Drowning us out only makes us feel left out, and when people feel left out they no longer trust the government to represent them.That's when you get things like militants, and radicals.Then you berate them as militants, and radicals, and you further push them outside of society.The cycle continues until anyone that isn't a Left Leaning Liberal is persecuted for their social values and marginalized by society.This is what is happening. People like me are being labeled as crazy, racist, sexist, even though none of those apply to me.Dividing the USA seems to be a national past time these days."
csjfqoj,jimbo831,Because they will lose in the primaries.
csjfeag,,"A lot of would-be republicans are so turned off by them that they're democrats now. That means that in order to win a republican nomination you gotta go so far to the right you can't possibly win the general election. It's a problem.I'd vote for Jon Huntsman though. Dude is a republican who just straight up says stuff like ""Call me crazy but I believe in evolution"" or listens to the facts regarding global warming. I kinda just hope the tea party thing becomes a ""viable"" third party and detaches itself from republican banner. That'd be excellent."
csjfg27,Minnesota_MiracleMan,"The thing that sucks about the Tea Party is that in its infancy, it was a great thing. But the uber conservatives jumped into this as their platform to appeal to the religious right, which wasn't entirely the purpose."
csjgnrl,bayfyre,What was the original intention of the Tea Party? I'm a little young to honestly remember them before the crazies got involved
csjh13q,JavelinR,"Reduce the deficit, and also scale back the government a bit. They were mainly fiscally focused and actually first formed under the Bush years in opposition to the growing debt. After the deficit exceed 1 Trillion dollars they got a lot more popular leading to them having some big wins in to 2010 midtearms. That they didn't care about social issues like your stance on gay marriage or weed was a big draw early on. But then people decided to hope on the band wagon causing the wheels to fall off."
csjh2e7,Minnesota_MiracleMan,"It's purpose was to reduce the Government's budget and get rid of many Government programs and spending in effort to fix the national debt. We can all agree/disagree on the merits of it and potentially how far they would go in cuts, but no where in its foundation was a restoration of religious rights. Using the Tea Party name to block same sex marriage, be pro-life, and institute conservative social policies was never something it was intended to be.It was a popular platform and as it was gaining support, the religious right who also fell in line with these fiscally conservative ideas jumped on board. The 'party' recognition grew and was then used as a rallying cry for the religious and super conservative right on all issues.While maybe it was a little aggressive as a fiscally conservative party, there were early supporters/members from both the Republican and Democratic parties. As soon as it was being used for a social platform by members, it lost all credibility in the eyes of the average American. There was no issue with some of these people joining. But beginning to use the Tea Party name as a platform for social and other issues is what really changed things from a bipartisan-ish grouping/think tank to a borderline new political party that aligned with the most conservative Republicans.Edit: Changed ""I"" to ""It"""
csjl6t5,vengeance_pigeon,"Not going to lie, when my parents started questioning their loyalty to the republican party in light of Indiana's recent legalization of discrimination, I was so shocked and happy I actually shed a few tears. If they can be alienated by the party anything's possible."
csjffi9,YungSnuggie,crazies vote.
csjhewk,Ko0kz,They wouldn't be able to win the primary. Republicans have to bend to the right to win the primary and when they try to bend back to the center for the general election they get labeled as a flip flopper and lose the moderates.
csjf6ar,gthermonuclearw,No but they can stay home. Or back a super extreme candidate in the primaries who has no chance of winning the general election.
csjf6mi,SithLord13,Because they won't show up to vote. It's one of the reasons Romney lost. He was too far right to get enough independents and too far center to get enough of the base.
csjfedu,Minnesota_MiracleMan,"Because there are candidates who, while maybe not actually believing all the shit they spew from their mouth, do play up to this base. And it isn't like we are talking about a fraction of Republicans. There are a ton who are super religious. And while they may still be supportive of same sex marriage, and aren't crazy religious, the idea of a person fighting for conservative values is appealing to a lot of people. The far religious right is the vocal minority. But there are a ton of people who align with conservative values.Not to defend them entirely, but you have to think about Small Town, USA. There aren't homosexuals walking around there. They make a modest wage and enough to get by. Not breaking the bank, but life is good. Maybe they got hit with the recession, but they also have some capitalist ideals. Point being: Gay Marriage isn't a concern for them. But it is for a large base and they default into that base.And that isn't all fact, but just how I see things. I went to school in a very rural area and saw this first hand, so I imagine, in the hundreds of thousands of Small Town, USA's, its the same way. Not all are crazy loonies, they are a vocal minority. But there are people out there that default into a similar grouping."
csjhhle,BenAdaephonDelat,"They don't have a choice. If they want to get nominated, they have to pander to the ignorant bigots in their party (because they make up the majority). It just so happens that they live in the digital age, so when they try to switch to a national platform after the nom, it all comes back to bite them."
csjg0ns,imawakened,"I have zero thoughts on your use of ""case and point"" but just thought you'd appreciate that the idiom is actually ""case in point"". Continue to write whatever you please though - just letting you know."
csjg697,Minnesota_MiracleMan,"Didn't know, Thanks! ""Case and Point"" just seems to make more sense than ""Case in Point"". Both make sense. ""Case and Point"" just has a mic-drop effect to it.I am leaving it how it is. Mistakes are mistakes, live up to them. But thanks!"
csjfjlq,THROWINCONDOMSATSLUT,"Mitt Romney was my state's governor. He wasn't all that perfect, but he wasn't a terrible governor either (unlike Deval Patrick, ahem). I probably would have voted for him in the presidential election had he not all of a sudden gotten much more conservative than how he was when he ran my state. In Massachusetts, he strengthened our public education system (number 1 in the country!) and created universal healthcare. It was kind of shocking to hear him go against that last one when running for president. Had he stayed moderate, I think he would have had a really good chance at winning the election."
csjfsq3,Minnesota_MiracleMan,"Had he stayed moderate, he wouldn't have won the GOP nomination."
csjg7fv,THROWINCONDOMSATSLUT,"That is very true. I'm really curious to see what's going to happen with these (what is it, 13?) candidates for the GOP now that health care and gay rights aren't as large of an issue."
csjgajn,Minnesota_MiracleMan,"I really hope we see the moderates able to come to the forefront, and even vocalize their support for these decisions. It will go a long way in securing the primary votes for people like me (young Republicans) as well as aid in their chances if they do win the nomination."
csjgu7x,THROWINCONDOMSATSLUT,"I sure hope so. I'm pretty in the middle myself, but I tend to lean Republican with a lot of issues aside from the social ones. For this upcoming election, I'm not so sure I want another Bush or another Clinton in the office. We'll learn more and more about the other candidates (aside from Bernie Sanders) as time moves forward I guess."
csjhlh9,Minnesota_MiracleMan,"Honestly, the Republican who says we need to look at the 2nd Amendment and make some changes for the 21st Century will get my vote. I probably align somewhat with their fiscal leanings. And now that these decisions have come down, I don't have to worry too much about them being against same sex marriage and tearing up the ACA (even though it needs some serious looking over to smooth things out)."
csjg1hi,XanthippeSkippy,"Case in pointSorry, pet peeve"
csjfdyl,skushi08,Now they don't have to worry. They can still win their primary without having to vocalize a stance against gay marriage or healthcare. SCOTUS has ruled so they can just side with their ruling. That's what kills them in the general elections. In order to win their primary they have had to offend just about anyone that isn't a hardcore Republican. Now they can stay a little closer to the middle
csjfo56,Minnesota_MiracleMan,"I hope that's the case. But it won't stop the Huckabee's and Santorum's from saying they will fight it. Those guys are also competing against each other.I love Bobby Jindal, but he too has moved too close to the religious right for my liking. My guy is Scott Walker, not on par with the crazy religious guys but very fiscally conservative. More so than I may be, but I like him. But I don't see him succeeding in a Presidential Election because of what he has done as Governor of Wisconsin."
csjfgwy,JirachiWishmaker,"Mitt Romney, the sellout"
csjfv26,MTRsport,John McCain was similar in a lot of ways as well
csjg507,Minnesota_MiracleMan,"Very much so. And he still is and even ran like it. His age really played against him. Not so much in the ""he will die"" arena, but when his opponent was so young and could identify with younger generations easily, he never stood a chance."
csjo5pu,MTRsport,"I think he stood something of a chance until he picked Palin, I would say that the odds were still in Obama's favor but the Palin pick was the mail in the coffin, to me at least"
csjgy89,Roez,"Meh, Democrats have to do that too. Just in the other direction."
csjh8kj,Minnesota_MiracleMan,Agreed. And its why people like Nancy Pelosi have risen to where she is. I just think its less severe on that side of the table.
csjhag7,ApprovalNet,Well Candidate Obama was against gay marriage too.
csjhg1v,Minnesota_MiracleMan,Same as Candidate Clinton.
csjhext,BenAdaephonDelat,"I find it hilarious to watch. They have to pander to the lowest common denominator to get nominated, but as soon as they switch to the national stage, all the shit they had to say catches up with them and makes it even harder to get elected."
csjm69v,sbamkmfdmdfmk,"To be honest, I doubt many of the candidates actually believe in a lot of the far-right rhetoric they parrot. But they know they have to spew it to have a chance to out-right the others and get the conservative base's support. Romney the primary candidate had to veer extreme right to win the nomination, but then yank the handbrake and swerve the wheel to try to turn around and get back towards the center to challenge Obama. As long as this is the GOP's nomination strategy going forward, they're going to continue to get spanked in general elections for a long time."
csjni4d,Nicklovn,"I loved Romney. I was so upset with people sayiny ""oh he changed his policy! Hes inconsistent!"" Damnit, he had to! It was strategy!"

csjknxu,Minnesota_MiracleMan,"I give away Internet points. I think they are important, in some ways. If they foster good discussion? Have an internet point. Hopefully it gets to the top and more people can discuss. Typically, if I respond to something, or someone logically responds to me, even in disagreement, I will upvote. A comment I disagree with or don't have a response to, but encouraged a good discussion, take some upvotes. I as much as a rail about silly internet points, I am now trying my best to give them out as much as I can to people who deserve them. They have a purpose. But that purpose isn't so you can feel good. Its to encourage good discussion and bring awareness to posts that do that."
csjhf7w,TommyyyGunsss,"It's honestly why they lose me. I'm all for fiscal responsibility, but why does it have to be attached to the pro-life anti gay marriage shit"
csjhicm,jvorn,"Well, historically that is what a lot of their constiants wanted and thus easy votes. Just wish they had the backbone to say: ""Look, I know you guys really like this social issue stuff but it's 2015 and it doesn't matter anymore. We all know you'll never vote Democrat so just man up and accept it"""
csjfgcg,Keyser_Brozay,"It couldn't hurt. I voted for Obama the second time (the first time I could) because he supports marriage equality. I understand the naïveté that demonstrated, but I made a decision that some social issues are too fundamental to our daily lives to ignore them when choosing our leader. Marriage equality was one of them. If the GOP hadn't been so GOP about the whole thing then I might've voted for Romney just based on his fiscal background. But no, they had to tell people that women could ""shut that thing down"" etc, etc. I just can't be voting for a party that willingly watches that type of ignorance flourish."
csjh7qd,LewsTherinT,"Social issues shouldnt be part of politics, they should be initiatives and referendums."
csjfphr,krysatheo,But doesn't that just turn them into libertarians like Gary Johnson?
csjfsqd,jvorn,The real GOP is in there somewhere. Small(er) government and fiscal conservatism.
csjkdli,Xanny,"Thats libertarianism. Seriously. The five year old definition of political ideology is that republicans are socially and fiscally conservative, democrats are socially and fiscally liberal, libertarians are socially liberal and fiscally conservative, and totalitarians are socially conservative and fiscally liberal. If you take the social conservatism out of a republican you are no longer a republican, you are a libertarian - small government that gets out of the way of both the social and economic engines of the country.The GOP has never existed in a state where it did not believe, at least in significant part, that the role of government was to dictate the morals and ethics of society according to a traditionalist view of social organization. It dates all the way back to the Whigs and other precursors to the modern GOP."
csjfxwf,thr3sk,"No, Gary Johnson actually has common sense. Is he running again this year? I know reddit loves Bernie Sanders, but I think Johnson would be popular here too."
csjg6ty,krysatheo,"Not sure, I hope he is. I like Sanders too but I'm pretty fiscally conservative so I prefer Johnson. My only big issue with Johnson/libertarians is the environment - protecting it is too important to be left up to individuals/states imo, needs to be done at the federal (or ideally the global) level, which libertarians oppose."
csjkpr5,Xanny,"Part of the problem though is that our economic policy directs businesses to be impossibly short term profit centric. Long term fiscal planning in corporate environments is at historical lows, even post-recession, in part because of wealth concentration and in part because of the unpredictability of federal economic policy, and the fact the fed is so powerful it can severely impact the whole economy with things like banker bailouts.If there were more confidence in the system, less wealth concentration (or just more democratized investment) you would naturally see business interests realign more to a healthy mid or long term outlook rather than maximizing quarterly dividends for shareholders, and if businesses need to care about longer term outlooks not decimating the environment matters a lot more.Not saying that is enough - plenty of enterprises can just not give a damn and slash and burn the planet for profit with impunity for a very long time - but there is definitely an economic argument that the scale of influence of the state in part contributes to the problem, in both fiscal policy that produces a very short-sighted market and in scope of policy that leaves uncertainty towards longer term business planning.I'm just saying it is not just an obvious answer that you should pass the ""stop wrecking the planet"" law of 2015. You also need to look at the economic motivators into why so few people give a crap in the first place."
csjnekz,krysatheo,"Excellent points, how do you feel about cap and trade (not just for CO2 but for lots of other pollutants)? That's the sort of thing I would think could only work well if implemented globally, so everyone is on the same playing field. And I think consumer demand needs to play a bigger role, people today seem to love blaming the ""big corporations"" for lots of stuff, but the main reason they are so big is because people buy their (usually unnecessary) goods/services. I'd love to see some sort of label or rating system identifying the environmental damage for a certain product, with things like the place where that cup of coffee was grown cut down x acres of forest and uses x amount of pesticide/herbicide etc."
csji9rv,SuperArff,"As much as I hate our current government in Canada, the GOP need to take a leaf out of the Conservative's book and stop running a campaign based on archaic beliefs that the majority of the nation is against."

csjmqms,daybreaker,"Lol at the idea that the GOP is going to drop these issues, and not actually double down on repealing everything that just happened to ""restore American morality"" as their 2016 platform."

csjo9sa,Sly_Wood,"Yup, just how Roe v Wade ended the abortion issue."
csjeqbz,gth829c,"There's that whole ""religious freedom"" thing now. That's going to be the hot button topic. Can we keep the gays out of our stores?"
csjf57p,ipn8bit,"Discrimination is legal except in the case of gender, race, religion, and ethnicity. ...but not yet sexual orientation, so you might be right.

csji49x,Happy_Harry,It's not about keeping gays out of stores. It's about not wanting to have to participate in something that goes against your religious beliefs.
csji67w,gth829c,Then don't serve the public. It's that fucking simple. You don't have a right to running a business. It's a choice. Unlike sexuality.

I'll have to check a companies discrimination policy before working for a company to make sure they hold themselves to a higher standard than the states I guess."
csjewhi,massive_cock,"This is quite true. This gives some space for the more forward-thinking Republicans, freeing them from constantly battling the choice between personal conviction and the expectations of their voting base. They can now just shrug and say 'It's settled law, whatever your beliefs or mine. Let's focus on other things.' It allows them to drag the party forward just that much more, that much faster, and over the span of an election cycle or two, it will help the younger members of the party shake out the 'rich old white guy' types and remake the GOP into something a bit less poisonous to the Republic."
csjf29f,,That must be why they dropped abortion as an issue back in the 70s.
csjetdi,fireinthesky7,"No, they'll just start bloviating about passing a constitutional amendment banning it like George W. did in 2000."
csjf0zl,AmericanOSX,"It would never happen. Unless American politics takes a huge shift to the right, its just too difficult to pass a constitutional amendment.You need 2/3 of both the House and Senate to approve the Amendment.Then you need 3/4 of the state legislatures to approve the Amendment.Even if it did get through Congress, there's no way 3/4 of the states would approve of banning gay marriage at this point."

csjew5h,3MinuteHero,"That's actually a really intelligent observation. There is no point in bringing up the issue anymore, so that's one less polarizing thing to talk about. And really it was **the** polarizing issue for democrats vs. republicans. Abortion is a few degrees below gay marriage, and not so huge a deal as to base a platform on it. Now they can get back to things that actually affect the majority of people...money, wars, etc.Cross sex off the list. No we just need drugs and rock and roll."
csjf08i,JR-Dubs,"I think this will actually thin the herd of potential candidates.

If you ask the GOP candidates whether they agree with the SCOTUS ruling, I bet 90% of them would say no to try not to give a direct answer. A very substantial portion of the Republicans do not want gay marriage to be legal and these candidates still have to pander to them."
csjf7y9,wolfehr,On the Today show this morning they said house Republicans are secretly happy about the ACA decision because it means they don't have to scramble to figure out a backdoor way to maintain those subsidies they're publicly against.
csjf81t,,"You misunderestimate Republicans.They could easily just say ""we need a constitutional amendment."" They've said it before."
csjf8tw,thedrew,"Exactly. The more they can focus on economic issues, the better their chances in the general election. The Christian vote doesn't stay sit out elections anymore, so you can't win by scaring them to the polls. They'll have to win by appealing to the middle.Or I'm so happy right now that I'm hopelessly naive."
csjf90j,coldbitterness,"I think 2016 might see a lot of changes in the Republican party, not just because of this but also stuff like so many speaking against the Confederate flag. If they have any brains at all (possibly a big ""if"") they will realize that they could really shake things up by backing off the explicit racism and homophobia. Both of those are still alive and well in America but you can't just use them as a substitute for an actual campaign the way you could even just a few years ago."
csjf97p,Isentrope,"On the other hand, an abortion case is headed up the Court for next year, so they might still take a whack at the social issues pinata."
csjfexs,Meph616,"Except it was, somehow, a 5-4 decision and not like a 6-3 or 7-2. I'm surprised there's a bigger margin for Obamacare than for civil liberties protected under the 14th Amendment.But any ways, keep in mind, Row V Wade was how long ago? Might as well be so old it's next to dinosaur bones. And that doesn't stop them from crusading to end abortions. In fact they talk about getting their judges into position so they can re-hear the case and get a new 5-4 decision in the other direction to outright ban abortion.And mark my words that's exactly what the 2016 election is now going to be about. Back to back MAJOR defeats in the SCOTUS rulings, first for Obamacare and now for Marriage Equality. They are going to hammer hard to try and win the Presidency on the grounds that they need to load SCOTUS with *their* judges."
csjfhlm,CaptainCAPSLOCKED,Nope. I'm waiting for them to debate about who could better push through a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.
csjfigw,EaglesX63,Not just as a whole but for the individuals. A lot of people have no real opinion on the issue but take the Republican stance just to win primaries.
csjfj3l,,"I'm sure the wackos like Santorum, Huckabee, Cruz, and others will play up the ""kicking and screaming"" platform of a constitutional amendment, but the eventual nominee will probably be the type who lets the issue go.Give it another couple cycles, let the country have time to see that the sky hasn't fallen, and *then* the issue will be over."
csjfo46,GonzoVeritas,"It will reinvigorate the GOP base to raise money for, and to elect, a republican that can change the mix of SCOTUS more to their liking. Hopefully the Dems will realize this peril and actually show up to vote at the next election."
csjfzx2,,> So one of their contentious issues is no longer a problemIt was never a problem. Now they're going to have to think of another wedge issue.
csjg0kb,,> because they no longer have the gay marriage issue hanging over their heads.BULL. SHIT.This issue is so firmly ingrained in the conservative platform. You just can't spend decades telling your constituents that gay people are more dangerous then terrorists and expect them to get over it overnight.This will haunt them for years to come.
csjg0ti,iweuhff11323,"If the decision had gone the other way, it also would've been a major mobilizing factor for young voters in 2016. So privately, most Republican politicians are relieved."
csjg6s3,digital_end,"I'm personally hoping that the GOP decide that they're going to try to amend the Constitution.That would be a good way to keep reminding voters of what kind of people they are, while being essentially harmless because there's no way they would get that much support."
csjg80l,sodapop_incest,The gay marriage issue will have to be dragged out of their cold dead fingers. They will fight this shit in the name of states rights for years to come I'm sure
csjgafz,markevens,"Not really, their crazy base they have to pander to in the primaries will want to hear about how they will repeal obamacare and reinstate traditional marriage. That is what they get for deviating from actual conservative values in order to lock in evangelical voters."
csjgdfk,InSearchOfGoodPun,"Yeah, just like how SCOTUS forever ended the debate over abortion.(Just to be clear, I recognize that it's a very different sort of issue, mainly because it's hard to ""chip away"" at marriage rights. But they would if they could.)"
csjgjxb,XxsquirrelxX,"The GOP will still oppose gay marriage. Sure, some will realize that they have been wrong as fuck for quite a while, but a lot of them will stick with what they've been doing for quite a while."
csjgk78,ZiggyStardst,Are you familiar with the GOP? Their campaign will be all about getting a president who will elect Justices (the next president will probably get two) to reverse these decisions
csjgq4d,sanash,"The problem is the GOP has cornered themselves by being on the wrong side of history on nearly all of their issues. The people that are supporting them are mostly supporting them on those issues such as anti-LGBT rights, anti-Civil Rights, anti-Obamacare, fiscal policy (spend, spend, spend and give all the money to the top), etc.Now as their ideas are unraveling they are going to be pigeonholed to their positions, if they decide to support the idea of gay marriage they alienate literally a huge part of their voting demographic, they might pick up some of the Libertarian vote but that's such a small demographic relative to the ""value voters"". Without the ""value voters"" they will fail.Not to mention they are going to be forced to continue railing on things like abortion and Obamacare. This is why I really hope that the democrats bring these things up during the next election and hopefully force Republicans back into their corner, make them state their position.So no matter what they do they are stuck due to their own stubbornness and ridiculous positions."
csjgwn6,sveitthrone,It's bad for the GOP. They've lost two major wedge issues that were huge parts of their platform over the last few years.
csjgzaq,HighKing_of_Festivus,They aren't going to let this go.
csjh176,,"> The SCOTUS took care of thatRead this as the SCROTUM .... all this gay talk, ya see"
csjh3a5,Delphizer,"Good for a pres election, but not a local one. They no longer have the issue to campaign on(Well they still will, but they can't campaign for change)"
csjh5qb,steady_riot,Yeah because they totally shut up about abortion after SCOTUS took care of that issue 40 years ago...
csjh7xy,jaCASTO,"Actually, anti discrimination/religious freedom laws are going to takes it's place. There is more to LGBT than just gay marriage."
csjhfor,yuekit,"Abortion was decided decades ago and is still a major issue.This will likely be an especially relevant issue for the next election, since conservatives will be extremely angry about it."
csjhok6,grizzly_teddy,"It will help the GOP.""Senator, what is your position on gay marriage""""Why is that significant? That issue has already been decided. My stance on gay marriage, pro or against, would have no bearing on how I will govern. Next question""."
csjhu39,junkfoodvegetarian,"Kinda like when SCOTUS deemed abortion legal - we don't hear them try to fight against that anymore either... Oh wait...At best, this makes it harder for them to make any progress in their efforts, but there's no way they are just going to let it go because of this."
csji821,TotesNotBatman,Just like abortion. Wait...
csji9eu,fco83,Once they choose to shut up about it. I don't think that'll happen right away with this multi-ring circus going on right now.
csjig9y,DamienJaxx,"If the GOP had also won on the ACA decision, they'd have to suddenly explain why millions of Americans can't afford health insurance without subsidies. Would have been a slaughter at the polls."
csjihw1,,Nope they are talking about making a Constitutional Amendment against something the majority of Americans support. Good luck with that
csjij0k,fgutz,"except doesn't repealing Roe vs Wade, which was a Supreme Court decision, get brought up in every election cycle? Or is this a different type of ruling? Will repealing this decision become a topic of everyone election cycle to come? Sorry for my Supreme Court ignorance."
csjjqek,just_another_classic,"I see Roe v Wade as a different issue. Gay marriage is much closer to interracial marriage, rather than abortion. No one cares about interracial marriage anymore. Abortion, however, some see it as murder. If you believed something was murder, wouldn't you vehemently try to stop it?"
csjix7n,GentGiant,It's going to be exciting to see how things shape up further down the road.
csjj42y,,Could a president such as Huckabee bring it up for debate again once sworn in as president?
csjk5v7,rwbronco,"I'm fiscally a Republican but socially liberal. This takes care of most issues currently. I won't be scared to vote republican based solely on social issues.There's been a few times where I'm like ""I want to vote for this guy, but he's going to trample on gay rights and I can't put myself responsible for that...""I know it's not popular to claim that on reddit but whatev"
csjknbl,,I guess now they can double down on abortion and food stamps?
csjkogb,ja734,"Yeah, just look how they immediately dropped the abortion issue right after roe v wade... oh wait..."
csjm8gv,smoothtrip,"They could say, that under the Democrats, all that happened, and they would work to overturn it if they are elected president."
csjmlux,aseriesoftubes,"> they no longer have the gay marriage issue hanging over their heads The decision in *Roe v. Wade* hasn't stopped the right from using abortion as a wedge issue for the past 42 years. Are they really going to let this issue drop? Unfortunately, I don't think so. It'll probably make them stronger.I worry that they're going to attempt to chip away at marriage equality as much as possible over the coming years, just like they've done with abortion."
csjmvqa,hyperfat,"Well then there is the problem of their hate on immagration. Hispanic population is going to be very torn, on one side they are religious and against abortion, but on the other side they want to be here and want their kids to go to college."
csjn91q,BeardedMurse,Yeah now get back to lowering taxes.
csjnoxx,Maximus8910,"Sorta depends on how their primaries go, though. If the GOP base goes too ballistic about this stuff they might nominate one of the more wingnut candidates. Basically this is good for Jeb, as long as it isn't better for someone else."
csjo886,Sly_Wood,Abortion was decided decades ago. Doesn't mean anything to the Republicans since they've been taken over by the Tea Party.
csjr3dr,just_another_classic,I see gay marriage to be more similar to interracial marriage than abortion. You don't see any leader advocating against the former.
csjto00,Sly_Wood,It has more to do with sex being taboo than race. So I disagree.
csju94a,just_another_classic,"We'll see how it goes. Race relations used to be far more divisive than they were today, and much, much more taboo. Also, there is not potential ""murdering"" of innocents with gay marriage, as their is with abortion. Abortion is a MUCH bigger deal."
csjof5b,,Any sane person knows that this wouldn't have happened with a majority of republican mandated judges in the supreme court. So let's hope that helps them more than it helps the GOP by sidelining a losing issue for them.
csjqtww,katsukitty,"They won't drop the issue. They'll now press harder than ever before for the Federal Marriage Amendment. Like the flag burning amendment following Texas v. Johnson, I don't see it making the cut."
csjsui5,RecordHigh,"I don't know if that's totally true. The radical right--the people that vote in primaries--will still expect candidates to be against gay marriage and gays in general, which may lead to even more outrageously bigoted statements and absurd plans for getting around this ruling. The tortured logic and overheated rhetoric should be hysterical to listen to."
csk4012,ChimRichaldsPhD,"I've heard/read that line a number of times today, from a number of different news outlets. This ruling is almost certain to lead to more ""religious freedom"" laws. Furthermore, it only makes the lack of workplace protections for gays that much more visible, and ENDA will be a big deal within the next few years."
csk6qjc,InvincibleSummer1066,"It is very, very, very good for the GOP. Socially liberal GOP member here.Yup. Very good."
csjewpv,unclejessesmullet,"I bet most, if not all, if the Republican candidates will still make it a key part of their platforms and promise to fight/overturn it, just like they will with ACA"
csjexfp,FlyingHazards,"Exactly. They will now say that they can't do anything. Obamacare has also taken care of the issue itself. As premiums go up, more people will find a problem with it and thus, reject the democrats for pushing the program through."

csjmdtp,,"Except that it was through the Benghazi hearings that the private, unsecured email server was discovered. If you think there's a legitimate reason for her to select which emails we're allowed to see, then destroy the rest and the server itself, I'm all ears."
csjoqgf,za3keaxi,You're watching too much Fox News.
csjotqm,BachStrad700,"Oh for fuck's sake, that's not even a response. You're saying you don't find it fishy?"
csjr0ut,za3keaxi,"She wanted to have some latitude without every diplomatic email she sent being scrutinized. I'm sure her husband shared the pain of that with her and suggested she find a way to avoid it. You can spin a conspiracy theory based on that or you can realize that it was probably just an unrealistic hope on her part, that the entire world wouldn't have to read every email she sent. It may have helped her negotiate more personally and be perceived as more genuine/authentic with any number of contacts, both domestic and foreign.I'm not defending her decision as a good idea, but I don't think it makes one bit of difference. Move on."
csk1tkl,BachStrad700,Good points!
csjqx3x,DorkJedi,"It was not illegal, and was common practice for previous Sec of State, including the holy Rice and Powell. Where is the outrage for theirs?THAT is how we know you watch Fox News, you think it is somehow uniqe to Clinton and not common procedure since email became a thing."

csjumrh,DorkJedi,You still have not explained the lack of outrage about previous Sec of States doing it.
csjud7b,,"Try none at all, and what I said above is a fact. There's no legitimate reason to destroy the emails and the server. It's not up to her to decide which of her emails are or are not relevant."
csjfq8u,Brutalitarian,She lost more emails yesterday http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/us/state-dept-gets-libya-emails-that-clinton-didnt-hand-over.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=1
csjf7sb,MrPeppa,That email fiasco disqualifies her from the POTUS position imo. I only see 2 reasons why she would use her personal account for potentially top secret government business: carelessness or malice. Either she did not understand the need for keeping such information in the intended place or she was hiding something. Neither are qualities you want to see in a president.
csjj9va,,Because until that time the Secretary of State had never had an official email and John Kerry is actually the first?
csjr1mk,DorkJedi,"Shh, don't give Fox News fans facts and logic. they have never seen it before, so it evokes a fight or flight response."
cskcpzf,MrPeppa,I didn't know this. How did a post so high up not have an official email?
csn2gcm,,That's a question I can't answer.
csn9kew,MrPeppa,Fair enough. Do you have a source for the position not having a govt email that I can read? I don't agree with hilary's politics but Im not about to discount her for the wrong reasons. I'd like to read up on this email thing for sure.
cso03yo,,"Sorry, I had it slightly wrong, he was the first SoS to rely primarily on his department email address whereas former SoS like Colin Powell used primarily their personal addresses."
cso6v7r,MrPeppa,No worries! So basically everyone was doing it the wrong way (varying in extremity) and we should have been raising a ruckus for a while now.
csv1039,,"Yeah, that's a good way to look at it."
csjr03w,DorkJedi,"It was not illegal, and was common practice for previous Sec of State, including the holy Rice and Powell. Where is the outrage for theirs?"
csjg6ss,causalNondeterminism,my understanding was that she felt it was more secure that way - secure from whom? the US government?
csjpdym,werewolfchow,"Well, considering that the US gov't gets hacked all the time now, maybe it was the right decision. If nobody knew about her server, it was less likely to be the target of a foreign attack.Plus, I've worked for the federal government. I'm willing to bet she put more money into security for her mail server than the feds put into their own cybersecurity..."
csjruj7,causalNondeterminism,"that was rather child-like on her part, then. basically, she didn't ask permission and did it anyway because she knew her ~~parents~~ government would say ""no""."
csjvja4,werewolfchow,The rules she was accused of breaking weren't even written until after she'd set up the server. She had no reason to believe she needed to ask for permission
csjggxe,MrPeppa,"Basically. And deleting a crapton of supposedly irrelevant/personal emails before handing the rest over to the government pretty much proves that she was doing something shady. If she was just conducting her job's regular functions, she would have handed everything over with a, "" my bad for keeping these in the wrong place"" rather than getting rid of a bunch of them suspiciously fast."
csjgum3,pab_guy,"Yeah, definitely sketchy.Here's the problem: I don't believe for one second that any of the republican contenders would do a better job as president.It's shit-sandwich choosing time, and emails are just the appetizer.These sorts of barely-scandals (compared to actual proven nefarious stuff, not just sketchy shit) just don't matter. People are going to believe what they want, or hold their nose and vote their ideology regardless."
csjj1s9,ojaldaconqueso,"Sigh. This is exactly how I feel. After today's decision I would feel a little bit less guilty voting Republican, but at the end of the day, there's still so many things (like Obamacare) that would be at risk. I know a vote for Hillary Clinton is basically a vote for Claire Underwood, but sadly we would still be better off."
csjsr60,gnoani,The solution is to NOT NOMINATE HILLARY CLINTON.
csjszko,pab_guy,So Bernie can lose in a landslide to Jeb? Do you think we are stupid or something?
csjt9hr,gnoani,"I'd almost take that risk, versus the ridiculous assumption that over half of the voting population thinks the Bush family has any winners in it."
csjukvd,pab_guy,"Don't forget that the other side will also be knowingly choosing between shit-sandwiches as well. Jeb only has to be better than the rest in the field, which isn't a very high bar."

csjg64z,Drekken-,"If you don't think this email issue is a big deal and makes her unqualified to be our president, you must have your head in the sand. She is corrupt and needs to give it up."
csjgve2,XxsquirrelxX,"I can find even more things that should immediately disqualify other presidential candidates. Chris Christie: Bridgegate. Also his horrid mishandling of Hurricane Sandy relief funds. And the betrayal of his state to win the favor of Iowa. Basically, the majority of New Jersey wanted pregnancy crates for pigs banned, but he vetoed the law (passed by about 95% of the legislators) because Iowa was a big pig farming state. Donald Trump: Bragged about his wealth. That's a big no-no, and will probably doom him. He also complained about how the U.S. didn't take enough stuff from the countries it invaded. This isn't too severe. It's more on the stupid factor. Jeb Bush: Gave the 2000 election to his brother. He was governor of Florida at the time, and we all know what went down in Florida. Mike Huckabee: Tried to keep the Duggar scandal down by shoveling money into it. Face it, all politicians are corrupt."
csjh7qt,Drekken-,"And I am sure most wouldn't disagree with you. They all have reasons, but the subject was Clinton. You feel like someone bragging about their wealth is worse than the secretary of state using her own private email servers for government work and then deleting incriminating emails from the server. I really can't see eye to eye with you on this one. Sorry. Clinton should be in jail."
csjjchn,,Isn't John Kerry the first SoS to use an official e-mail? Haven't all other SoS used their own e-mail?
csjhfie,XxsquirrelxX,"> Clinton should be in jail. And so should Chris Christie. Now, about Trump. I didn't say that bragging about your wealth is worse than using private emails. But keep in mind he basically wants us to be a pirate nation, taking resources from the countries we invade. Bragging about wealth is stupid, but wanting to plunder countries? That's scary."

Maybe.But remember what happened to that pizza place that denied services to a gay couple? The courthouse in the town can not refuse to give them a marriage license. If the clerk doesn't want to do it, fine, but the courthouse will have to issue one.Equality is winning. It's okay to be positive for a moment."

csjf7yo,GomezFigueroa,It's funny you include anti-abortion. Because the Supreme Court decided that states can't ban access to abortions the same way they now can't ban gay people from getting married. So it seems like the gay marriage thing could still be an issue for a while.
csjgcro,fatcat2040,The next few years will be interesting as conservative states find technically-legal ways to restrict gay marriage. Maybe buildings where marriages are held will be required to have admitting rights at a hospital that is less than 120 miles away?

csjfm6i,inputmethod,"And we should be loud and vocal about all of them. It's crazy it took America this long to legalize gay marriage, but now we have momentum. We need to be vehemently opposed to anti-trans, anti-women, and anti-minority legislation. Trans people experience more violence than almost any group. Their suicide rate is many times higher than average. We desperately need to create a world that is inclusive of them.Women certainly deserve freedom over the choices they make regarding their own bodies, and don't need doctors forcing them to sacrifice their choice at a future they want (and sometimes their lives) for an embryo they may not even want. And in the event they do have a child why are they not getting paid extended maternity leave like many other first world countries offer? Why do women make less than their male counterparts?Minorities have long been the backbone of this country. The workers that built our industry. That they are marginalized, subjected to violence and institutionalized discrimination (e.g. extreme profiling by police leading to absurd incarceration rates, lower education, and public degradation in the media such as being called thugs or being made a spectacle of) is abhorrent and not indicative of a society that touts progression.Sorry for the rant...it's just very important. And while all the issues are important I urge you to look at the plight of trans people in regard to violence and suicide rates. It's unbelievable. 10-15 year olds committing suicide."
csjl68t,thenichi,"I'd like to take a moment to also include being vehemently opposed to anti-poor legislation and in support of pro-labor legislation. (Though maybe finding more appealing words--I'm not a PR people by any means.) Especially since much of the anti-minority stuff at this point goes:1. Minorities are disproportionately in poverty2. Poverty leads to crime and other bad shit3. Minorities are, as a result, disproportionately involved in crime and other bad shit4. Most people see crime and other bad shit in a bad light5. As a result most people see minorities in a bad light (e.g. the fabled ""black culture"" that is so terrible is just poverty's effects)You can't stop the hate until you fix poverty. While it's doable (other v=countries have done it), unfortunately the fight is much, much harder since it does actually affect others (the only fix for poverty is a better distribution of resources, which means some people have to lose some of their current share)."
csjtnfh,Avant_guardian1,"Minorities are also targeted and unfairly treated by public institutions. They are arrested, charged, and convicted at higher rates. Look at NYC and Boston's ""stop and frisk"" stats and read the DOJ report on ferguson. It's glaringly obvious the police and courts target poor minorities."

Meanwhile in the north you had the massive industrial revolution going on and the overwhelming majority of those workers were white. That's what built the US, not cotton."
csjodgw,inputmethod,You're crazy if you think hundreds of years of slave trade and slave labor didn't shape this continent and make America what it is.
csk3bpo,ApprovalNet,"No slave labor was fucked up and it definitely had a huge impact on tobacco and cotton industries. But when you talk about what actually ""built this country"" I don't think most people think of tobacco and cotton, they think about the massive industrialization in the north (manufacturing, steel mills, mining, oil, shipping, railroads etc) which was almost entirely white laborers (with the notable exception of Chinese coolies on the western half of the transcontinental railroads) until after the turn of the century and long after slavery had been outlawed."

I was excited at the idea that people could actually kill themselves instead of just wait around to die, because then I could speed up the process of going to heaven where God would let me be a boy. I heard that heaven was supposed to be a happy place....but then I chickened out when I saw that ten stories from the top floor of my apartment block was a really long distance to fall."

Few conservative politicans actually cared about it, and many liberal politicans were happy for a distraction from the more nefarious things they were doing behind the scenes.It's like running decades of campaigns on ""Should we kill puppies or not?""Foreign policy, economics, etc. are ""real issues"" because they are things that legitimately need to be debated and don't necessarily have one right answer. Things like gay marriage, abortion, and Obamacare are issues that conservative think tanks drag out (or, in the latter case, make up) because they make conservative voters feel ""icky"" and uncomfortable and distract them from serious problems in their lives, like the economy and war, where liberal ideas might actually make some headway in the election. If no one's paying attention to *those* things, establishment politicians (Democrats included) can continue feeding their corporate masters through legislation and no one's the wiser."

In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves.

csjeq0n,Rad_Spencer,Rumor has it they may be planing a protest....
csjfasi,Their_Police,I thought it was assumed that they're always planning a protest.
csjfxpp,kimburly,It is so ordered.
csjhyg4,,"It should be an Onion article: ""WBC Announces Five Things They Will Not be Protesting. Everything Else will be Protested."""
csjg57m,,As is tradition.
csjhg22,GhostFaceDrillah,"That's their secret, they're always protesting"
csjinpi,RogueToasters,Even at protests they are planning protests

csjj0mu,InsertNameHere77,"But wait, when do they ever stop protesting to plan the next protest?"
csjlqje,thenichi,Their website has tour dates.
csji0ct,cheffgeoff,"It's hard to understand, and by no means am I an expert in mental health issues and abuse which is the foundation of the Westboro Baptist Church, but these guys aren't protesting in any way. They want the world to burn in an apocalypse where they the ""righteous"" are vindicated and exulted on high while the rest of us burn in Gods wrath... via Satan... who is doing all of this against God's will... but then will punish us as God's agent... the details get a little fuzzy. But the point is that they want this stuff to happen so that the end of the world comes sooner rather than later... again the details are fuzzy as to why, but it goes without saying that mental health issues and patience don't always go hand in hand.What they are doing is more of a PSA about how they are right and following God's path by making it perfectly clear that they disagree with Satan's politics. They don't give a flying fuck if you agree with them, or get your mind changed by them, in fact the exact opposite is true; the less people that agree with them the more heaven they get. They just want to make it crystal clear to God that they are on God's sign... with bright posters just in case he has bad eyesight or is a little fuzzy on their relative political positions. So stuff like this give them a real chubby because it means that the end times are coming sooner. Just remember if they cared about changing the hearts and minds of people they would have a better PR department. They just do this as a form of proof for after the end of the world so they can point and laugh at us saying ""I told you so!"""
csjp4sw,ohnoao,"I never thought of it that way and I think it's a good explanation. It doesn't make any sense to me, but I get it. It sure seems like wasted energy. It's like OK, we get it, you believe you're going to heaven and everyone else is screwed. How many times do you need to go picketing?

csje8mu,smooshie,"Kennedy wrote majority opinion. Four dissents, one by each justice, whose tears I will happily drink.Edit: 64 pages of dissents. While Roberts was somewhat gracious, and congratulated gay couples on their new right (while rejecting the idea that it comes form the Constitution), [Scalia is straight out tantruming](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/26/antonin-scalia-dissent_n_7671110.html)."
csjeqk9,evanb_,"> whose tearsRoberts's dissent is very respectful of the decision. Though I disagree with his assessment, I certainly appreciate the way he presents it."
csjffqw,,"He really is a gentleman. People feared the worst when he was appointed, but unlike Scalia who will write scathing and nearly insulting dissents, Roberts generally conducts himself as we should expect of the Supremes."
csjfm39,evanb_,"Even Scalia's dissent was tempered. You could summarize it as ""This case isn't about gay rights. Marriage isn't a federal right for anyone, and the majority is writing their own Constitution."""
csjierp,TexasLandPirate,"well, comparing the majority opinion to a fortune cookie was colorful."
csjijbe,evanb_,"Yes, I would call it colorful, but not scathing or insulting."
csjkisp,bobeo,I would call it insulting.
csjknj2,IAmTheRedWizards,"I found it remarkably clueless, personally. He went on at one point about how the decision revealed the ""true ruler"" of America to be ""the nine lawyers sitting in the Supreme Court"". Well, Scalia, since it's their/your job to interpret the Constitution, and the Constitution is the supreme law of the United States, then...yes? This should be rather obvious?"
csjm4b1,bottomlines,"Fuck dude, I'm not even American, but I think his point is incredibly clear. The supreme court isn't supposed to make new laws, right?"
csjmc52,Morbidmort,"Well, they didn't. They just found that some laws were in conflict with the Constitution."
csjmedh,RocketPapaya413,"Correct! But the reason why a lot of the dissent is so confusing is that the Supreme Court did not make a new law in this case. They just interpreted existing law which is their exact purpose. Part of the problem might be in how the case is being reported. People are saying, ""Gay marriage is legal!"" when it could be more precise to say, ""Gay marriage isn't illegal!"" Those two sentences sound the same but the difference is that the first one would be making a new law."
csjn4lj,IAmTheRedWizards,"Well, good thing they didn't then. They ruled that the 14th Amendment doesn't allow for same-sex marriage bans."
csjogg3,Arianity,"They didn't,they just interpreted an old one in modern times . thats their job"
csjiv55,butyourenice,"But... As long as things like spousal visas exist, how is marriage NOT a federal right?"
csjizg8,twistedfork,"I recently watched a special on PBS about two gay men who tried to get a spousal visa in the 80s. Kennedy (the same one that wrote the court's opinion) was the final nail in their coffin that did not allow them to remain together and in the US. Instead they went abroad for a bit before returning and living together, one an illegal immigrant."
csjjcof,KingMoonfish,Things and people change. 35 years is a long time.
csjme2r,twistedfork,"Sorry, that was the point I was intending to make. It was also made in the special, as it followed the couple's journey from 1980whatever to ""present"" (I believe it was released two years ago). One of the men was still alive after the ruling 2 years ago in which Kennedy also wrote the court's opinion."
csjtg5t,RecordHigh,"Tempered, I don't know about that. The first paragraph of his dissent contains this:> I write separately to call attention to this Court's threat to American democracy.And there are a half dozen other ridiculously hyperbolic statements like that in his dissent."

csju7p9,RecordHigh,"I can't say that I'm a Scalia scholar, but I've read a few. I'll grant you that if the standard you're using is Scalia's more extreme opinions, then this one is tempered."

csjieo9,General_Mayhem,"The two choices aren't mutually exclusive. Scalia and Thomas both joined all of the dissents (Roberts's, Alito's and each other's) in addition to writing their own. Scalia's even calls it out in the first few lines, something about agreeing with the Chief Justice's opinion in full but wanting to write his own as well to draw extra attention to the breach of democracy."
csjiibp,evanb_,"Yes, I misunderstood what I was responding to."
csjgr75,ObviousLobster,"That's Roberts for ya. Extremely smart, extremely kind, but with a clear conservative twist."
csjiyua,AirborneRodent,Am I the only one who noticed the sass in Roberts' dissent?Go back and look at all the quotes he uses from recent decisions urging judicial restraint and caution. Basically every single quote was from a Kennedy opinion.
csjif16,,Roberts is a grown-up with a sense of decorum that is very good for the Court.
csjksve,FireHazard11,"He really is. It's weird to think about the massive shit storm that was caused when he was appointed by Bush. Everyone was freaking out about appointing a fairly young judge to the SC and immediately promoting him to Chief Justice, but he's proven to be pretty damn good at it."
csjij4j,Cyberhwk,I think that's going to be the way it's going to be with Roberts. He understands the court and its rulings don't exist in a vacuum. I would not be the least bit surprised if he was in fact thrilled with the result despite not being able to find the same result legally.
csjpfo8,,"I respect with the way he presents it, I disrespect him for his attempt to deny basic rights to millions of people."
csjzaf6,Evsala,I agree. But Scalia!
csjfwwh,haffbaked,"Yeah I can see why he believes it should be up to states to decide on whether or not its legal, but good job on the Supreme Court for going above their heads and ending the argument."

csjei5r,glass_hedgehog,"Personally, I can't believe this passed with a narrower margin than the Obamacare ruling yesterday.I knew it would pass, but who would have thought Obamacare would have a bigger margin?"
csjelok,banebot,Anyone who paid attention to the Obamacare case knows that it was not long for the court anyways. It was a semantics argument on word usage in a very esoteric part of the bill. It was not the fundamental healthcare knock-down drag-out fight the media made it out to be.
csjfgjt,conpermiso,"And in fact that court's decision addresses the fact that intent trumps some awkward wording, which is as close to a ""get out of here with your weak ass shit"" as you can expect from the Supreme court."
csk3219,,"The courts decision in the third to last paragraph calls the argument about the wording ""strong"". That's the exact opposite of what you claimed it said.Pretty much no one in this thread actually read the goddamn decision. Especially if anyone thinks ey were even remotely dismissive of the argument."
cskj7hp,conpermiso,"It also says that it's obvious congress did not intend for the law to fail, therefore the government's case is stronger. ""Get out of here with your week ass shit"" is certainly a hyperbole, so I concede the point."
csjfh9k,RichardMNixon42,"The liberal technocrat consensus was actually to be very worried. A case came out earlier in the month dealing with ambiguity and even Kagan leaned on the literal interpretation. In this particular case, the literal interpretation was just too stupid for Roberts and Kennedy to believe it was intended."
csjfc1r,CaptainCAPSLOCKED,"Eh, settling esoteric semantics arguments make up the bulk of what the court does. Very fuckin rarely are major socio-political cases decided as thoroughly as this."
csjgjdu,,Which is obvious when you consider that this wasn't anywhere close to the right's best arguments against Obamacare (which had already been shot down in the courts).
csjfpgh,Comeh,"I know what you mean, but its a sad day when ""not too long for the court anyways"" makes it to the Supreme Court."
csjiegz,fco83,The bigger surprise is that they took that case at all instead of letting lower court opinion stand
csjy9h4,Rephaite,"To be fair, the marriage case hinged on semantics, too:the wording of that obscure, esoteric amendment to the Constitution, #14, says that people are entitled to equal justice under the law.But wtf does ""people"" even mean? Or ""equal justice.""The Supreme Court had to call in several expert witnesses, by which I mean kindergarten English teachers, to resolve this weighty and perplexing riddle."
csjey71,,"> It was a semantics argument on word usage in a very esoteric part That's just simply false. It's pretty clear you didn't even read the majority opinion. The part of the bill at issue was critical to the tax credits and the word usage in a bill is NEVER ""just"" semantics in statutory construction and interpretation."
csjgc3t,gnoani,"The issue literally came down to what it meant for the law that congress had used the phrase ""The State"", in context, OBVIOUSLY intending to refer to the Federal government, but in a passage also referring to individual states."

csk2ze3,,Semantics is used colloquially to dismiss an issue as not important. That's how it was used here. If semantics was used in its true definition then what was said would be obvious and true of nearly all SCOTUS decisions.And it certainly was not an esoteric part of the bill. That's an indefensibly false statement and the fact that it has 300 up votes.... Wow. If that's esoteric so is any section of the 900 page bill.
cslsva9,pab_guy,"You are introducing a ""colloquial"" usage of semantics that is different from the definition of semantics? When OP was clearly using the word correctly, referring to the meaning that can be derived from certain syntax and it's context.

csjeowk,,Its not a ruling on whether theyre a good thing or not. Its merely their interpretation of the constitution. Obamacare: Laws intent *did* allow subsidies. Gay marriage: marriage *is* constitutionally a right for all. Makes sense because of the tradition of states rights in contract creation is greater than the court stopping legislation of ambiguous language.
csjew9a,glass_hedgehog,"> Its not a ruling on whether theyre a good thing or not. Its merely their interpretation of the constitution.I'm well aware of how the Supreme Court is supposed to work. But considering how so many highly publicized court decisions come down hard along party lines lately, it was just surprising to see that something with so much bipartisan support in the population at large (gay marriage) came away with a narrower margin than something that is still pretty inflammatory and partisan (Obamacare)."
csjfkz2,DrMuffinPHD,The Obamacare decision should never have reached the supreme court. The legal question at issue was so blatantly settled that if it hadn't been about a highly divisive political issue the lawyer who suggested litigating it would have been laughed out of the room.Here there was at least an unsettled legal question about the application of the 14th amendment.
csjeo6r,,"The Obamacare case hinged on the vague definition of ""state"". Previous cases have allowed the vagueness to exist and it deserved the same treatment.

The majority cannot be allowed to oppress the minority--this is what would happen if fundamental rights were open to straight democracy. It is not a matter to be voted upon. That is what the SCOTUS is saying. Suppose a law was passed tomorrow stating that Mexican Americans cannot have children. It doesn't matter if the law was passed with a majority, it is unconstitutional because it infringes on a fundamental right. Furthermore it gives that right to one group of people but not all groups."
csjnv8z,KuztomX,So if marriage is a fundamental right (which I'm not sure it is) then polygamy is a right as well?
csjijw6,Scientific_Methods,Bullshit. The decision is very rational and based on the equal protection clause. Your argument is the same argument used to support the continuation of Jim Crow laws.
csjjd8u,KuztomX,Bullshit to you. Over 30 states already legalized gay marriage. The process was already working. This is nothing more than King Obama wanting to circumvent the process so that it would be legalized during his presidency.

The people of a State are free to expand marriage to include same-sex couples, or to retain the historic definition.""Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether, in my judgment, the institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. It is instead about whether, in our democratic republic, that decision should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law. The Constitution leaves no doubt about the answer.**Criticizes Activist Judging:**""The majority's decision is an act of will, not legal judgment. The right it announces has no basis in the Constitution or this Court's precedent. The majority expressly disclaims judicial “caution” and omits even a pretense of humility, openly relying on its desire to remake society according to its own “new insight” into the “nature of injustice.”""The truth is that today's decision rests on nothing more than the majority's own conviction that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry because they want to, and that “it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right.”""**Should be up to the States:**""The Constitution itself says nothing about marriage,and the Framers thereby entrusted the States with “[t]he whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife.”""**Purpose of Marriage is to produce a child:**""This universal definition of marriage as the union of a man and a woman is no historical coincidence. Marriage did not come about as a result of a political movement,discovery, disease, war, religious doctrine, or any other moving force of world history—and certainly not as a result of a prehistoric decision to exclude gays and lesbians. It arose in the nature of things to meet a vital need:ensuring that children are conceived by a mother and father committed to raising them in the stable conditions of a lifelong relationship.""**The Bitter Conclusion:**""If you are among the many Americans—of whatever sexual orientation—who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today's decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it.I respectfully dissent.""**And some bonus quotes from Scalia's dissent:**""The opinion is couched in a style that is as pretentious as its content is egotistic. It is one thing for separate concurring or dissenting opinions to contain extravagances, even silly extravagances, of thought and expression; it is something else for the official opinion of the Court to do so.""""If, even as the price to be paid for a fifth vote, I ever joined an opinion for the Court that began: “The Constitution promises liberty to all within its reach, a liberty that includes certain specific rights that allow persons, within a lawful realm, to define and express their identity,” I would hide my head in a bag.

If you don't like your forever job, fuck off. Heterosexual Christian here saying it's not my business who people love, how they love or whom they marry.

csk26bl,dcman00000,"SO this is what he said in the opening of his dissent....> The substance of today's decree is not of immense personalimportance to me. The law can recognize as marriagewhatever sexual attachments and living arrangementsit wishes, and can accord them favorable civilconsequences, from tax treatment to rights of inheritance. Those civil consequences—and the public approval thatconferring the name of marriage evidences—can perhapshave adverse social effects, but no more adverse than theeffects of many other controversial laws. So it is not ofspecial importance to me what the law says about marriage.It is of overwhelming importance, however, who itis that rules me. Today's decree says that my Ruler, andthe Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is amajority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court. Theopinion in these cases is the furthest extension in fact—and the furthest extension one can even imagine—of theCourt's claimed power to create “liberties” that the Constitutionand its Amendments neglect to mention. It really just sounds like he is worried about the integrity of the constitution, specifically based on the ""substantive due process"" interpretation or the ""procedural due process"" interpretation. One is simply the letter of the law, and the other allows for expansion of rights...basically amending the constitution...from a majority of 9 unelected judges. Doesn't sound very democratic to me, and indeed sounds like a threat tot he integrity of the legal system and a proper interpretation of the constitution."

So potentially it could actually affect the lives of people who either decide not to get married at all or who're in a hetero-marriage. Independently of whether that is justified or not, it seems to me that factually, the argument is wrong."
csjvz0o,DiggingNoMore,Like those who tell me I should wear a skirt. Women wear whatever they want; so do I.
csjf96b,,"I mean this is the Chief's dissen, doesn't seem like a bitter asshole:>Although the policy arguments for extending marriage to same-sex couples may be compelling, the legal arguments for requiring such an extension are not. The fundamental right to marry does not include a right to make a State change its definition of marriage. And a State's decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational. In short, our Constitution does not enact any one theory of marriage. The people of a State are free to expand marriage to include same-sex couples, or to retain the historic definition.>Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step of ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex marriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority's approach is deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens—through the democratic process—to adopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept."
csjg6qw,ResonantOne,"And it's entirely wrong as well. Specifically,>a State's decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human historyis such a blatantly false rewriting of history that it only solidifies my point."
csjgubb,,"The SG affirmed that fact under questions from the bench. Its not really, don't be salty."
csjh0pv,ResonantOne,"It is false. There are verses in the Bible, the book that these people so often love to use as justification for their beliefs, that describe all sorts of laws and definitions of marriage. The fact is that the institute of marriage as it is, or rather was, known in the United States of America was not in any way a definitive example of the definition of marriage throughout human history. The entire argument is bullshit."
csjh7rc,,"The party representing the pro-marriage side, when questioned on state definitions of marriage as being between one man and one woman, conceded that that is the definition of marriage which has existed throughout history. In examination referring to specifically Greek and Roman foundational concepts of marriage he admitted the presence of homosexual relationships that were tolerated by the state but not giving the same standard as heterosexual marriage. You are saying an argument, which the PERSON WHO ARGUED THE DAMN CASE FOR THE PRO-GAY MARRIAGE SIDE, conceded had significant merit and was factually true, is entirely bullshit."
csjhi0p,ResonantOne,"It's bullshit because it implies that meaning cannot or has not ever changed. It used to be law to marry your brother's wife if you brother died. It used to be law to marry your slaves. But it has been decided, at least in more civilized places, that these practices no longer respect basic human dignity. The opposing argument is that despite the fact that we changed those laws, somehow their biblical definition of marriage is beyond all change."
csjkpn0,Accalon-0,I think you're not reading the statement.
csjhrv3,,"I didn't even reference the biblical definition. Literally, reread what I wrote and the Supreme Court was primarily concerned in questioning regarding western foundational traditions (greece and rome) not religious traditions and how homosexual could be accepted without endorsement or codification. I literally said nothing about the bible."
csjowgy,DaffyDuck,"It only makes sense in the context of religion. It doesn't make it excusable, just more understandable. Our laws shouldn't be based on religion. Glad to see this finally happening."

csjejj0,Hotwir3,People are all sorts of dumb. Local radio show was having people call in and talk about when the most dangerous time in our history is and I just heard a caller on the radio say the biblical times when you could be struck down by God at any moment.
csjgki7,smurphy1,So did the caller think God is no longer around?
csjj1gs,Hotwir3,Based on stereotypes and her accent... I'd say so. She said something about people being struck down by God before the new testament was written? Maybe that changed things.
csjekvg,Slimerbacca,"Yup, way more dangerous than times we can actually prove were dangerous"
csjeple,joe2105,"Or someone who thinks that God doesn't want them to vote to legalize gay marriage. Yep, that's my crazy Catholic family and I'm proud not to be a part of that."

csjk6de,Slimerbacca,Mainly their own traditions and not caring about what others want to do
csjk82b,xfcanadian,"Oh I know, it is really silly"
csjki8l,Linearts,"The scary reality is that plenty of perfectly happy people who don't even appear to be hateful apart from this, opposed this decision, just because of an unfounded dislike of gay people. It's kinda creepy in a way you never see these days with racists - sometimes I meet people who seem perfectly nice at first, then it turns out they're religious bigots who think gay people are going to hell. If someone hates Jews or something, you'll probably find out they're an awful person within 10 minutes of meeting them. But no, it's considered normal to hate gays in various parts of the world, even in the 21st century, which just seems anachronistic to me."
csjlwmf,,"I told my grandma this morning about all this. She said like it is an abomination because the bible says its a sin or something like that. But, you know what? She's honestly a caring and nice lady; she saved me from living in my parents house and was basically my mom. My parents never had a problem with gay marriage, but they are shitty, absolutely terrible people. A person's beliefs are not strictly indicative of the kind of person they are."
csjlxv7,xenemorph,"It's not so much that they try to deny marriage. It was just a religious thing exclusively between a man and a woman. Then it turned into a government thing, which also now gives people rights to get married even though it doesn't mean anything. If you have to get married to celebrate your love then you're miserable."
csjmswy,Rednedivad10,It's people like you that alienate the opposition even more. Insulting people with different beliefs has never gotten anyone any more credibility or swayed anyone to your side. Just chill out and realize they feel as strongly about their position on the matter as you do on yours.
csjnpfq,Slimerbacca,"I dont care, fuck those miserable people"
csjod78,sandwhale-,Yeah. Fuck the gays. How come they don't have to suffer through marriage but straight people do?
csjor5o,president2016,"Except in this case if you're redefining marriage, why stop at 2 people? I support legal contracts, unions, partnerships, etc in the eyes of the law, but believe government should not be involved in marriage. In this case, the dissent got it right as to the rule of law whereas the majority appealed to emotion."
csjqgjs,Slimerbacca,"What definisiton of marriage am I redefining? Homosexuals have been getting married for years, over a decade here in the US alone!"

csk413x,intensely_human,"> Only someone miserable with their own shitty life would basically do most of the shit that involves using the law to prevent pleasure. And the thing is, their lives aren't shitty. Their lives are fine - family, food, freedom - it's their minds that are shitty because they see the negative in everything. Can't really blame them though - it's hard when you're born before internet and somehow missed LSD and are stuck with CNN's view of the world for the last few decades."

csjjlle,EMINEM_4Evah,Why would you marry OPs mom?
csjhe51,joeyadams,Islamic State already allows that.
csjohxt,,"Jokes aside, this ruling does pave the way for polygamy to be legalized again."
csjtrnh,Casual-Swimmer,Why? Who you can marry doesn't correlate to how many people you can marry?
csjtwtj,,"Why should polygamy even be illegal? Once we have (rightfully) changed the definition away from One man One woman then why shouldn't we legalize polygamy? As long as it is conse sual and not abusive, who cares?"
csjw8il,Casual-Swimmer,"For polygamy in the US to be legal, marriage rights between all parties would have to be established. Historically, it creates a population imbalance where wealthy elites marry the majority of women. We like to think women would have equal opportunity (polyandry), but this almost never happens in reality. Even in polyandry societies, the conditions were vastly different from what we have in the US. Humans also started with polygamous societies, but as we've developed, societies changed to monogamous relationships. It is just better overall not having an imbalance of eligible suitors.Morally, it is not a partnership but dominance. There is always abuse, not just from husbands abusing wives but wives abusing other wives. Oftentimes, women who enter in polygamous relationships do so not of their own volition but due to religious or economic reasons. Legalizing polygamy would only justify, and perhaps perpetuate those practices.I also like to point out that polyamory is another option that allows multiple partners that are not specifically bound by marriage. If people wish to have multiple partners, then there are communities that support these types of relationships here in the US."
csjwmgt,,"If guys marry guys then they can't marry girls. Thus imbalance of suitors. These are all the same arguments used to fight gay marriage, and we got past those. Polygamy is no different, and I guarantee it will be legalized as well. If polyamory is OK, then why would polygamy be wrong? That's the same thing as saying ""you can be gay, you just can't call it marriage""."
cska5oj,Casual-Swimmer,"Polygamy enforces a system of dominance of one gender to another. Gay marriage doesn't do that. And historically, it has always been one sided. And marriage is distinct from a polyamorous relationship. While you may exchange husbands and wives for a weekend, in the end everyone goes back to their same couplings. And it's always an exchange, never one person hogging all the wives or husbands."

In the past, specifically related to the justice system, the court has ruled that you have to prove that someone had explicit racial bias, even if you could show bias with statistics (I.e., you had to have proof your prosecutor hates black people, not just statistics showing he gave white defendants better plea bargains).

And I think you would be surprised at how many Republican Candidates were supportive of this. Many can't really speak out in support of this because of how insanely diverse the Republican voting base is. It really sucks.I think its obvious how a Republican could get my vote in the upcoming primaries. And the one who can do this, and still win the GOP nomination, will be a tough beat. I think many, if not most Americans, would fall in line with many of the moderate conservatives. They just don't want to be associated with the religious far right and the candidates must be associated and support those views to get elected. The Democratic side of the house has the same problem, but not as severe."

csjjom0,ergister,"It would have been just as unconstructed, but at least they're not negatively pushing a controversial political view in an already politically charged comment thread so he can start an argument. It was the way they went about it. All it was was blatant negativity and childishness for the sake of getting a rise. You never answered *my* question. You just asked me another question instead"
csjk1jq,,"I'm not really inherently disagreeing with you on that issue. I just don't understand why when someone has an opinion that is a) not harmful to anyone and b) not with the status quo it gets attacked and downvoted into oblivion.I don't like the ACA. My family members are paying almost as much as they make in one month to access ""affordable healthcare"". And if they don't pay, they get fined. It may help some people immensely, but I think it is a clusterfuck for the most part and I think it's a shame that it was upheld instead of dismantled and remade entirely into true universal healthcare.But I don't get to have that opinion on reddit, in context or otherwise. And it just annoys me that you chose to attack *that* comment instead of the garbage about gays not being allowed to adopt or any of the other off-topic, negative dribble."
csjk97f,ergister,"You see, that's at least constructive! While I personally benefit from the ACA, I understand that it doesn't help everyone and more importantly, you have every right to be upset. That response is a lot better than ""haha any but affordable it's a joke derrrrr"". Those are the things that piss me off. You seem to be taking it out on me that reddit doesn't agree with you. There are probably a lot more people in reddit who benefit from the ACA than don't, but I don't know that for sure"
csjkiv7,,"Not trying to take anything out on you. And I don't care that reddit disagrees with me. I just feel that, being a liberal myself, you guys can be extremely pretentious and close-minded. Not *you* in particular, just the fact that anybody who had a different or negative opinion is automatically a bigot or a conservative moron, or even the notion that all conservatives are morons in the first place.I'll concede that the comment was slightly obnoxious, so maybe my dissent here is out of place. I don't know. Ultimately it's not a big deal, and I didn't mean to turn this into such a lengthy discussion."
csjknyo,ergister,"Eh. I need something to do at work. Seems like more people agree with you anyway as all my comments are in the negative lol. The guy who made the obnoxious comment turned out to be a pretty obnoxious person in general, so there really wasn't anything to be gained by my comment either"

csjg1l5,ergister,"Yes, you are a crybaby. Some guy mentioned the ACA, and you, being high and mighty and defender of all your opinions to the death just *had* to comment! You couldnt think to yourself and say ""Gee, this thread has nothing to do with the ACA, someone mentioned it and the connotation was good, I don't like the ACA but being as this thread is about Gay marriage and everyone seems pretty happy, maybe I should just leave this alone and be happy with them!"" No you sat there and said ""Guy likes something I don't like, must make sure he knows he's wrong!"" It's ridiculous, childish behavior and has place here."

Our system is designed to be slow-acting and is sometimes frustrating when our institutions seem to lag behind the beliefs and opinions of the general public, but over time freedom and the will of the people *typically* comes out on top. You may believe that suffrage for women, social security, equal rights for blacks, government health care and gay marriage all should have happened sooner, but they did eventually happen. And it's not always the people you expect making the biggest differences. Chief Justice Roberts, who led the majority in the two key Obamacare decisions, is an appointee of George W. Bush. Justice Kennedy, who provided the key vote and wrote the majority opinion in today's ruling, was appointed by Ronald Freaking Reagan.I'm wondering what's next. National legalization of marijuana? That's my guess. Repealing the 2nd amendment is another one I think will build over time, but I think we're a generation or two away on that one."

csmmqxp,B4SSF4C3,"An institution like marriage is older than any country still in existance today, don't need to exactly think it up.

csukfs6,sir_snufflepants,"> if someone has the right or privalage under law, we cannot exclude others from the same right of privalage due to some aspect of the person that is beyond his or her control.Except this means pedophiles could never be prosecuted, incestuous relationships -- especially non-harmful ones like homosexual incest -- should be permitted, and anyone who suffers from an inborn disease should be vindicated of all legal wrongdoing."
csuu3mk,B4SSF4C3,Straw-man argument is a straw-man.

A strawman is an argument that purposefully makes your opposition's position weak in order to knock them down easily.*Reductio* arguments aren't strawmen if they show an argument's weakness by applying its principles or logic to equivalent cases.In this case, you claim unequivocally that the law cannot burden or prohibit an activity (like getting married) based on *inborn* differences. If that's true, the law cannot prohibit incestuous marriage."
csjg16k,greencoinman,"No, it's because there are at least 5 justices on the Court that know what ""equal protection under the law"" means.It's kinda scary that 4 don't though. I mean, these 4 people don't even have a basic grasp of the Constitution apparently."
csklg33,sir_snufflepants,">No, it's because there are at least 5 justices on the Court that know what ""equal protection under the law"" means.And what does ""equal protection"" mean? Before yesterday, a gay man could marry a woman, and a straight man could marry a woman. Weren't they *equal*?Or do you mean ""equality"" in some more fundamental sense? But what fundamental sense is that?The difficulty is that laws always burden people differently. Laws against robbery burden robbers by punishing them for robbing others. Is he being treated unequally because the law prohibits what he wishes to do?>know what ""equal protection under the law"" meansWhat does it mean here? Are we defining the ""right to marry"" as the ""right to marry *who you love*""? Thus, prohibiting gay marriage treats me unequally because I love someone the law prohibits?But that still can't be the definition of the right. Otherwise we'd allow pedophilia and polygamy. Perhaps incest, too. So how do we define the right to marriage under equal protection such that marriage can only occur between two people, who are of age, who are not related to each other, who are not already married, are of the same sex and must be the same species -- all without treating people who fall into those other categories *unequally*?You will not find a right to gay marriage in equal protection.Gay marriage is a substantive due process issue. The question simply and solely is, ""Does the government have a legitimate reason to prevent two homosexuals from marrying?"" In simpler terms, ""Does society have an interest in preventing this action?"">I mean, these 4 people don't even have a basic grasp of the Constitution apparently.And where in the Constitution and its illustrious history do we find the right to gay marriage? How do we know the Constitution protects a right if it's not within its written word?Rights in the Constitution are not the product of social norms, they are not the product of current public policy. They are the product of well defined historical categories. Why? Because when the Court engages in the business of reshaping the Constitution, granting and denying rights based on modern preferences, we end up with *Dredd Scott* and *Plessy*."

csjj075,M00glemuffins,"All of our relatives except for my still very Mormon parents live in Iowa, and we like doing holiday stuff with my wife's family. Being close to them was a big thing. Being in a larger city was another, my wife and I have long wanted to live in one and the place we live at the moment is literally right in downtown Minneapolis. The political/economic climate is also more to our liking. Very open minded and liberal, we have the biggest PRIDE festival in the Midwest going on this weekend about a block from our place and it's going to be even more amazing with this announcement. People are just sensible normal people here. I go out to happy hour with people from work, I can discuss controversial topics, I can chug delicious coffee, all without getting the fuck judged out of me by a bunch of uptight Mormons. Besides the political/cultural landscape Minneapolis is constantly at the top of lists for best city to live/healthiest city etc etc. Biking is HUGE here and Minneapolis proper has this awesome network of bikes you can grab from a station (which are all over the place) ride around and drop off at another station for a small fee each time or for as many times as you like if you get a yearly membership. Trails line the city and you see tons of people who just bike to work or wherever they're heading to every day. Minneapolis is also close to some really beautiful areas for camping and outdoors activities like the Boundary Waters, Lake Superior, and the thousands of other lakes within the city itself and around the whole state.There may not be mountains to hike like in Utah but there are plenty of beautiful place both in the city and out with trails to explore and nature to see. I can't speak highly enough for how much we've loved it here so far. It's just so refreshing after living in the shithole that Utah felt like to us."

csjmbvh,kaisawheel,I think that homophobe OP is not actually a homophobe and really just isn't into the idea of gay sex and has somehow conflated that with the idea of homophobia. I think there is a difference between homophobia and poop-dickphobia.
csjjtzw,carorea,"To be fair, he's probably using ""homophobic"" in its true sense - an *irrational* fear of gay people. It sounds like he knows it's irrational and still thinks of gay people as people who deserve equality, but he's irrationally afraid of them.I had an extreme phobia of needles (I would need to be held down for shots when I was young; I'm better now but still have a slight phobia of them, though I can at least get them without totally freaking out). It makes no sense. Needles don't hurt much and I know that, and they generally are used for beneficial reasons (not including illegal drugs). That doesn't stop me from being irrationally afraid of them though.I'm assuming it's a similar thing with that guy; just a crazy, irrational fear that he knows makes no sense."

It's just a culture shock right now, and it should go away over time for most people (although there are still racists today so not for everyone)."
csjlss1,,"It's still a kind of mild homophobia right? Like if he avoids them? I mean, someone might believe in affirmative action, the civil rights movement, the Ferguson protests, etc and still cross to the other side of the street at night when they see a black dude in a hoodie."
csjmgox,tonytroz,"Correct. In an ideal world that sociological bias doesn't exist, but in reality that stuff isn't going away anytime soon. Still, I'm sure those affected by this ruling would much rather deal with people who avoid them than people who stomp all over their human rights. You just have to be careful that doesn't lead to discrimination. It's not really a problem if someone crosses the street so they can avoid a gay couple, but it is if they refuse to serve them at a restaurant because they don't want to wait on their table."
csji4l4,,"You don't have to think about gay sex every time you think about gay people. When I see a straight married couple, I don't imagine them having sex in my mind. There's no reason to be weirded out."
csjpttu,FatCat433,"Wait, we aren't supposed to imagine couples having sex whenever we think about them?This is awesome! Now I can think about mom and dad all the time!"
csjia67,SmolderingDesigns,"I mean, is that really what constitutes being homophobic? Because if you have to be all, ""I love gay sex and it turns me on,"" to not be homophobic then I guess I have a problem. I'm just not sure how being uncomfortable with someone's sex life makes you a homophobic, especially if you have the belief that they should still be able to get married, have the same rights as everyone else, ect."
csjj5an,Abshole,Kinda makes me sick to my stomach.
csjnfzj,AlwaysWannaDie,"But atleast one of your good friends in your life has been gay, and he was fine wasn't he? Im not american but I am so happy, literally goosebumps. My life goal is to make change happen for real and for the ones who have been fighting for this since the 60s I cant even comprehend how big this must feel. I hope I can join your ranks some day. Love from Sweden!"
csjhd7b,DamienHanrahan,"Heads up, this isn't homophobia. Plenty of progressive people like myself are weirded out by two guys kissing but have the maturity to recognize people should be allowed do whatever they want and have the same rights as everyone else. I would be appalled if I was considered a homophobe because I think two guys kissing is kinda icky."
csjwn33,I_am_Qam,"Well, I mean it is homophobia. There are a lot of homophobic people that entirely accept there actions, but are made slightly uncomfortable by their relationship. Hatred isn't a necessary component to homophobia at the most literal level. If homosexual relationships make you irrationally uncomfortable, you're homophobic to a degree. But that isn't necessarily 'bad', and you can still fully support the movement for equality."
csjxtk7,DamienHanrahan,>Definition of homophobia in English:>noun>[MASS NOUN]>Dislike of or prejudice against homosexual people.It's just not something I like looking at but it doesn't make me homophobic. As long as you fully accept homosexuality and treat gay people the same way you treat a straight person then you're not a homophobe.
csjjz7v,baldurs_turnstile,"The word 'homophobic' has picked up a connotation beyond the dictionary definition of ""fears and hates the idea of homosexuality"". Seeing as you seem like a reasonable person, you might want to hesitate before labeling yourself as such so freely, as people might take it the wrong way.Here's what I mean by these shades of meaning: I'm gay. Do you want to bash my head in? Are you comfortable being a friend to a gay person like me? No reasonable person expects a straight person to be comfortable with the idea of gay sex. Do you think discomfort or disgust with the idea necessarily qualifies as homophobia, given the connotations the word has picked up?The idea of sex between a straight couple makes me uncomfortable. I wouldn't go as far as to say I'm repulsed, but I'd just rather not think about it. Does that make me heterophobic? I'd say not."
csjqqlp,sargonkid,Wow! WOW! You seem to embody the pinacle of tolerance and acceptance. I applaud you!

csjhrgn,shadownukka99,"Wait, homophobic but equal minded? I'm confused"
csjhx7f,,"As a gay man, I appreciate your thoughts and respect your right to feel the way you do. Cheers."
csji0ew,glutenfreeprincess,"The fact that you recognise this probably means you're not as homophobic as you think you are. As long as you would never treat someone as a lesser person because of their orientation.Realising and admitting that the problem lies in your own discomfort with it rather than any fault of theirs is deserving of respect. It's in human nature to feel a certain amount of uneasiness with things unfamiliar to us, so kudos to you for not letting that turn into hate and intolerance.Supporting something you're personally not comfortable with because you know it's the right thing to do is admirable and almost more significant than support from those who are comfortable with it"
csji3gz,,"Don't know whether to downvote you for being a bigot, or upvote you for realizing that it's your problem and no one else's. Fuck...have an upvote."
csji8ee,lostintransactions,"I do not think you are homophobic, I think you just believe (in your head) that it may be either unnatural or gross (or both). I would bet at least some gay people think the same thing about ""us"".There is a difference. What you are describing as yourself is probably societies wide definition for ""homophobia"", true ""homophobia"" is having a fear of ""gay"" or a gay person in some way. If you were truly fearful, you would not support this or be happy about it.Today's media/society defines homophobia as simply having an opinion that is not *all encompassing* acceptance.It's now like the word ""hater"" a hater is someone with a different opinion. Don't like the latest Taylor Swift song? You're one of her ""haters"". Homophobia has gone down the same path.I think what same sex couples do behind closed doors is *their business* not mine but it would also be ""gross and unnatural"" if I were *forced* to watch it (which obviously I am not). That is NOT homophobia.If you can have a gay friend, talk with gay people and/or support gay marriage, you are NOT homophobic.I am glad this was passed, hopefully this is finally over and people will not be denied happiness for their sexual preferences. However, I will not be attending any gay pride parades or perusing gay porn (just the hetero kind) ;)"

csjpczy,Neoking,"I have never heard this type of opinion, and now that I have, I really wish more people would adopt it. It's okay to not feel comfortable with same-sex marriage, but your uncomfortable feelings *should not* have a say in the personal matters of other people. Good on you mate."
csjppgv,Anderrn,You should probably look more into why you are uncomfortable around people than try to convince yourself that you are happy for those you don't like.
csjqjrg,,Just cause gay sex weirds you out doesn't mean you're a homophobe.
csjrn7v,apollonius2x,You are one extremely confused individual.
csjs5zd,harmar21,"Yup im somewhat the same way I was brought up in a religious home so my upbringing was very anti-gay. I held similar views until I moved out and saw the real world. I will still say I am somewhat homophobic, but like you, that is my problem that I am trying to correct. Its hard trying to undo 25 years of brainwashing my parents gave me in just a couple of years. Logic tells me I shouldn't be homophobic, and it is completely irrational for me to be that way, but then the voice of my mother comes in my head.... Hell last years I found out my cousin was gay. My mom completely freaked out and sent me some 2 page religious rant on why it was so wrong. I sent her back an email saying what she is saying is uncalled for and that she is the same person that my mother knew the day before. I told her not to email me again regarding those hateful thoughts. I sent an email to my cousin congratulating her for coming out. But of course for some reason I just see her differently now, and I am a bit more distant to her than I used to be.. even though I know I shouldn't be. It irritates me that I am this way, but I think I will finally be rid of the homophobia within the next couple years, at it is way less now than it was even 2 years ago."
csjsz21,DorkasaurusBBQ,Thank you for your honesty and your ability to see the bigger picture.

csjibt6,CANT_ARGUE_DAT_LOGIC,Homophobic is a natural response to an unnatural sexual desire. You are the normal one. Society has brainwashed you in to thinking you're the crazy one - you are not.

csjhifr,Pharmax,"Petitioner's stories from the court's opinion:> Petitioner James Obergefell, a plaintiff in the Ohio case, met John Arthur over two decades ago. They fell in love and started a life together, establishing a lasting, committed relation. In 2011, however, Arthur was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. This debilitating disease is progressive, with no known cure. Two years ago, Obergefell and Arthur decided to commit to one another, resolving to marry before Arthur died. To fulfill their mutual promise, they traveled fromOhio to Maryland, where same-sex marriage was legal. It was difficult for Arthur to move, and so the couple were wed inside a medical transport plane as it remained on the tarmac in Baltimore. Three months later, Arthur died. Ohio law does not permit Obergefell to be listed as the surviving spouse on Arthur's death certificate. By statute, they must remain strangers even in death, a state-imposed separation Obergefell deems “hurtful for the rest of time.” He brought suit to be shown as the surviving spouse on Arthur's death certificate.> April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse are co-plaintiffs in the case from Michigan. They celebrated a commitment ceremony to honor their permanent relation in 2007. They both work as nurses, DeBoer in a neonatal unit and Rowse in an emergency unit. In 2009, DeBoer and Rowse fostered and then adopted a baby boy. Later that same year, they welcomed another son into their family. The new baby, born prematurely and abandoned by his biological mother, required around-the-clock care. The next year, a baby girl with special needs joined their family. Michigan, however, permits only opposite-sex married couples or single individuals to adopt, so each child can have only one woman as his or her legal parent. If an emergency were to arise, schools and hospitals may treat the three children as if they had only one parent. And, were tragedy to befall either DeBoer or Rowse, the other would have no legal rights over the children she had not been permitted to adopt. This couple seeks relief from the continuing uncertainty their unmarried status creates in their lives.> Army Reserve Sergeant First Class Ijpe DeKoe and his partner Thomas Kostura, co-plaintiffs in the Tennessee case, fell in love. In 2011, DeKoe received orders to deploy to Afghanistan. Before leaving, he and Kostura married in New York. A week later, DeKoe began his deployment, which lasted for almost a year. When he returned, the twosettled in Tennessee, where DeKoe works full-time for the Army Reserve. Their lawful marriage is stripped from them whenever they reside in Tennessee, returning and disappearing as they travel across state lines. DeKoe, who served this Nation to preserve the freedom the Constitution protects, must endure a substantial burden.What kind of rational person being could deny humans the right to contractually declare their love? As a Canadian, I am so proud of this SCOTUS decision!"

csjxbsu,nihilxnihilo,Religious people who work in the wedding business will now be forced to participate in gay weddings even if it violates their beliefs. I don't believe they should be compelled to do that. There was also mention of tax free status of churches being revoked if they refuse to perform gay weddings as a possible ramification of today's decision.
csjxt98,cakelorldeath,No one will be compelled to participate if they don't want to. This decision doesn't force religious institutions to perform these weddings. This only affects civil unions via the State
csk0gom,Mccalltx,Is that fact that they will be forced to do same sex marriages or speculation?

We needed to get all these super pity social issues (in the sense of they should of been passed awhile ago) dealt with so we can focus on some of the biggest problems that we face such as our lack for fiscal responsibly and how it will not only effect my generation (I'm 20 and probably well never see my social security benefits) but any generation to come.

csjo9zo,kansasbears,"cross-posted from /askreddit: Here's something to think about... My husband and I were married in 2013 after the DOMA decision by SCOTUS. When we got back home, I called our insurance company to update our marital status in order to get the ""married"" discount. Turned out since the state we lived in didn't recognize our marriage, no discount for us.Well, after the SCOTUS decision today, I again called the insurance company, and said ""No problem"" we update your marital status right away and ""Congratulations"". I was very pleasantly surprised. The rep then asked when we got married, and I told them. He said if I could send them a copy of our marriage certificate from when we were married in 2013, they would credit us the difference. The marriage discount turned out to be over $700 a year cheaper. I was really blown away by the difference and how they were willing to make it right for the time lost.TLDR: If you have home/car insurance with your NOW legal spouse, call and get your married discount. It's really worth it."

Only recently has gay marriage become a hot topic for the republican party.I'm not Republican but I really hate the whole ""Republicans are fucking retards!"" stuff that I see on Reddit every day. God forbid people have different opinions than your own. My dad, for instance, is a republican. He is pro gay rights, we have close gay family friends, and is quite honestly one of the smartest people I've ever met. The thing is, he's a true Republican in the sense that he just doesn't want a large government with overreaching powers.Also, a real Republican would by the very nature of what a Republican is supposed to stand for be 100% in favor of this change. Republicans are supposed to be pro small government, that is, the government isn't really supposed to tell you what to do in your daily lives outside of the obvious legal aspects of it. It's lame that the party has shifted to one of such conservative religious bias."
csjjldi,xienze,"> Republicans have spent decades trying to deny same-sex couples the right to marry.Hmm I don't think that is really accurate.

csji8vn,sirixamo,"> 1996That was 19 years ago. I'm not saying it was right back then, but 19 years is a long time to change your mind on a topic (after being influenced by public opinion). Are we upset with the millions of normal Americans that have changed their mind over the last 20 years? Marriage equality has made huge strides, even without the courts. You should argue they shouldn't have had to, but then you'll be bitter and discourge any mobility on social issues in the future.

Clinton and Obama ""flip flopped"", they changed their mind, maybe they had a real moral change of heart or maybe they just did it for the votes. Regardless, would you prefer that no politician ever change their mind on social issues? That stigma is exactly why we can't actually have a discussion about anything where we influence the other side to change their opinion.

csjfdk9,AnOnlineHandle,"Isn't that the same thing in this case? That was the party who wanted to make some people less free, now they've been stopped."
csjgip0,NoseKnowsAll,"I truly hate partisanism. It inevitably just turns people into a ""I'm right, you're wrong"" cat fight."
csjgq38,,How is marriage a constitutional right? Especially when the states all have different and varying laws about it
csjhys6,ARGUMENTUM_EX_CULO,Did you even read the decision?
csjh6dd,sterlingphoenix,"We absolutely should be doing that. This is a step forward for *society*. In the long run, this makes things better for *everyone*, even people who oppose it."
csjm72y,yungtatha,I mean it's so fun though. Look at the comments on the Fox News website. It's just beautiful
csjrf6g,iPADboner,"You are one of the only people who I've seen making it political. Quit being partisan altogether, it damages the democratic process."
csjrxj2,RemingtonSnatch,"It's more like ""suck it, bigoted assholes"", and it's entirely appropriate. Not all Republicans are anti gay-marriage."

csjgr2m,Crankyshaft,And the Republicans have not evolved. They remain reactionary and bigoted.
csjil0c,kisses_joy,Can we do both?
csjioq4,,"What you're saying is admirable, but for people who have been told ugly disgusting terrible things all their lives by a group that is predominantly Republican, saying ""suck it GOP"" is part of the great release coming from this decision. Let's absolutely celebrate freedom, but let's not pretend like one party didn't fight tooth and nail to oppose this freedom."
csjk0w2,Trillen,Clinton and his defence of marriage bs helped support marriage equality how?
csjk8q3,sabbathan1,"The Republican agenda is, and has been for a while, largely built around limiting the civil and constitutional rights of people. I've not even American, but you can tell that from the other side of the world. So it seems pretty reasonable to be saying 'suck it, Republicans'."

csjex19,Captain__Marvel,Congratulations to the U.S LGBT community! One day people will look back and wonder why equality had to be made law and why it wasn't a basic human right.
csjhmd0,elementsofevan,That's what the justices said. They didn't change the law they just said that the bans states made were unconstitutional.
csjgxfb,cleaver_username,"I feel very happy that I got to be alive during such an important issue. But then I'm sad that I'm alive during such important issue. Seems like it should have been taken care of long before 2015. Witness history though, so that's cool!"
csk1btw,atomicxblue,I think they'll probably spend more time explaining why it had to be restricted in the first place.
csjgfdz,CurryF4rts,"I understand Roberts' caution for the Democratic Process in his dissent, but the only argument for banning homosexual marriage made by respondents was that States needed to encourage procreation, and that was a sillllllly argument. Ginsberg shot back asking if we should ban marriage for seniors who were unable to procreate and there was no logical answer that followed."
csk1koi,atomicxblue,I think it also failed because no one was able to give a rational explanation why it should be banned without resorting to a religious aspect or an 'I find it icky' defence.
cskchr2,CurryF4rts,"They didn't really mention religion. Respondents argued that the state had an interest in procreation, and that if we allowed gays to get married then people wouldn't respect the institution of marriage and pro create"

csji5h4,Velshtein,Amazing to see how far this country has come. 10 years ago I sat in my senior year high school Law and Society class in my fairly liberal state and town and was the only person who raised his hand when we were asked if we felt gays should have the right to marry. To see the change in opinion over the last decade and now this is pretty damn interesting.
csjiazf,bwayc,I keep crying happy tears. I worked on my first political campaign in Ohio in 2004 when gay marriage was on the ballot. I was working for liberal causes in a VERY conservative country. The hatred I saw made me positive I would never see gay marriage legalized country wide. Today is a great day. I wish I was in Ohio celebrating

csjnxo2,lupuscapabilis,"It's a bunch of people basically saying ""don't impose your gayness on me, I'm too busy imposing my religion on you."""
csjnfkb,GoldenStateEducator,"What just happened today will cause (and already has caused actually) a whirlwind of discussions, both good and bad. I am concerned about how these discussions will play out across the internet and across political landscapes, but on the whole I am happy.We all know what the Bible says about homosexuality, and it needs not repeating. I am a devout Christian, who loves Jesus and wants to live a life just like he did. I love America. I love the fact that in this country I can be the Christian I want to be without any persecution. When Jesus walked this earth, what he desired most was for all people to love each other, build each other up, elevate each other, and treat each other with compassion. He practiced it and preached it, ministering to people from all walks of life.As a Christian who loves Jesus, I feel nothing but joy and happiness for the individuals in this country who have long felt disenfranchisement, persecution, and ignorance due to the negativity that some have poured upon homosexuals and the idea of giving them equality. As we all know, we are all humans at the core of it all. And I personally believe that - at the core of it all - we are all brothers and sisters in Christ. As a Christian, I fully and firmly believe in what the Bible says, because I personally believe that the Bible is the Word of God. I am glad that I can believe this in America without persecution. But as a Christian, I am happy that my brothers and sisters who were once oppressed can feel happy. I desire nothing more than that.So to the LGBT community, I say this: Congratulations, I love you all. I wish you all the best in your future endeavors. And if ever you receive any form of persecution or negativity about who you are from anyone who labels themselves ""Christian,"" just know that they're very likely being hypocritical.Peace!"

csjkmxt,JudgmentCall,"For sure WSJ et al. capture the intellectual wing of conservative Americans. But for mass appeal populist conservatism, what competes?"
csjhumv,bcrabill,It's literally their business. They aren't telling their news out of the goodness of their hearts and a desire to inform. They're selling ad space.
csjfyhg,ndphillips,"You are partially right, I'd say. People like Chris Wallace and Bret Baier are pretty good newsmen.But even on their normal news shows (not like O'Reilly, who is commentary), they have lead ins like ""Could your name be on a death panel?

To package the opinions of the viewer into a news format.The cable networks do spend a lot of money on real reporting, and during the day just report the news. However, I think they still deserve a special place in hell. They selectively report stories to support the narrative of their opinion shows. In essence they have turned reality into a soap opera that can maintain a consistent viewer base."

csjgc10,HarryPFlashman,"Your descriptions is not quite accurate. Their news is less biased but is subtlety biased enough to help set up the talking heads later.It is expertly produced propaganda. Since you won't believe me let me try to use an uncomfortable analog which has an application based on today's ruling. Anal Sex.Lets say you are trying to convince your significant other to engage in anal sex but he or she is not entirely comfortable with the idea. So you start out slow- by making a joke, or comment about hearing about and see if he or she reacts, then you get a little more overt- like hey everyone has tried this great thing called anal sex, then now that you are talking about anal sex you really bring out the big guns- LUBE, planning for anal sex, discussing when and how. Then next thing you know you are having anal sex and if you were the reticent party you wonder- hey how did I end up here having anal sex.Subtle baby steps, one little bit at a time. Thats how.And that my friend is how Fox news works."
csjhorg,,"I'm well aware of what they do and how they do it. I've been a journalist for ten years and have worked with them and CNN affiliates. My point is that their ""news"" is no different to other tv news channels in America. They're all inherently biased because they are all privately owned."

There's still a scroll, there are still ""anchors and reporters"" covering things. It's all a bit misleading. It's not like back in the day of Edward Murrow's very distinct opinion pieces against McCarthyism. They would cut from their news broadcast to his editorial and it wasn't presented as anything other than one man's opinion."
csji9rf,Ariakkas10,"You're right, buts it's always been obvious to me that the was opinion. Megyn Kelly is a good example. Yeah she has a desk, but she brings on talking heads, she argues with people etc. It's obvious to me.

csjiei8,AsskickMcGee,"Oh, it's quite obvious to me as well. Anyone with any knowledge of journalism should be able to see it. But remember the words of George Carlin: ""Think of how dumb the average American is. Now, think of how half of all Americans are dumber than him."""

csjg256,jimbo831,"Yeah, Fox and Friends is truly awful."
csjf76x,kousi,"One thing people don't understand is that there are two sides of Fox news, the ""hard news"" and the opinion/commentary shows. The opinion shows are usually the ones that tow the line hard, while the hard news is mostly like any other network's news (Shep et al)."

csjgrs0,fatcat2040,You mean foxnews.com?The comment threads are still there and as painful as ever. The one for the gay marriage story is very active right now.
csjfmva,maeshughes32,It is hard to tell sometimes who are trolls though. There are a ton of them in there right now.
csjfoix,wookiewin,"You gotta hope that it's more trolls than not, because some of the comments make my stomach hurt."
csjektz,EckhartsLadder,They can't control that.

csjf1qb,p_pasolini,They could. They just don't.
csjf4q0,Their_Police,"Wasn't there an article saying that websites would start being held legally accountable for their comments sections? It could've been for a different country, I don't really remember. Basically it stated that if the site didn't make some attempt at moderation or removal of bigoted/hateful/harrassing comments they'd be held accountable."
csjf3xu,t-poke,"Comments go in, comments go out. They can't control that."

csjeu1e,Demonweed,"Just now I got a chuckle from a partial reading of Scallia's dissent. He begins by defining ""hubris"" as if he were struggling to rise to the level of a first week assignment in a second rate public speaking class. I don't want to give the troglodyte too much credit, but this result clearly has him off his game as a writer."
csjey38,sciomancy6,Give it time. O'rielly doesn't come on till later this evening.
csjeqcm,Cylinsier,"The news portion of Fox News isn't any better or worse than the news portion of any of the cable networks. Plus, the gay marriage issue is pretty much over even for most conservatives. Only the rightest of the right wing still want to fight it. Most of the party has recognized that married couples regardless of gender are better for the economy than unmarried couples. Marriage means tax breaks which means more spending money going back into the private sector. Now when the opinion shows on Fox News get started, it will be a different story. I think O'Reilly is pretty neutral on this issue at this point, but I can only assume Sean Hannity will muck spray from his mouth in response to this. Fox and Friends may just spontaneously combust when the cameras start rolling."
csjg4nu,killswithspoon,"Among cable news, I've observed Fox usually has the most level-headed and relevant news reporting. Shepard Smith is a great newsman, I'm actually surprised they've retained him for so long.People obfuscate their commentary and opinion segments (Which are quite bad, but then again all punditry holds that distinction) with their news sections."
csjgcwg,ejson93,"When it's a news program, it's just that, a news program.. not an entertainment outlet. They get a bad rep because of a few people who lean hard right and that's where all the hate comes from."
csjr7h6,Cinemaphreak,That's the inconvenient truth about Fox **News** - they do actually report the news in a consistently straightforward manner. The problem comes with all their talking head shows - that's where the unbridled bias kicks in.

It amazes me a site that complains non stop about Fox could muster such a god awful sub for covering politics that is so full of delusional, hatred, bigotry, and bias it almost makes me want to disagree with them out of principle. Don't say it's a diverse forum with many opinions, it's nothing but 1 school of thought devoid of any discussion where dissenting opinions are downvoted to the point you may as well not even try to go against the consensus and it IS representative of this site because it frequently makes it to the top of /r/all."

csjerii,inksday,"And? Their literal economic future and ability to feed their families was on the line. Hell the South still hasn't recovered from the economic blow of losing slavery. It was a whole lot more complicated than just ""Derp, we want to own people, Derp"". Their entire industry relied on it. Not to mention most of the soldiers who fought were too poor to own slaves to begin with and were just defending their homes and their families from an invading force. Most of the war was fought in the South and tons of damage occurred. At that point you don't really care what the original reason for the war is, you defend your home and family first."

CNN shit the bed when they started trying to compete with FOX for the shock and awe, outrage, cover a murder for 5 weeks, type outlet.

csjglq8,Gabs00,"Their headline: ""Supreme Court rules in favor of same-sex marriage""CNN and MSNBC: ""Gay marriage legalized in all 50 states""They both get the same point across, but Fox's lacks the ""yes we did it America!"" tone that the other networks exude."

csjgox2,markevens,Go to the comment section. It is like a live stream of right wing hate and other people mocking them.
csjh3ve,seamustheseagull,"When Ireland legalised same-sex marriage, those opposed to it reacted with very little emotion. Very much a bit of a clap and a handshake. Sort of like, ""Good game, well played, congratulations on your win"". The fact that they reacted as if they had lost a football game made them even creepier and more unsettling. This wasn't an argument of passion or of rights for them. It was some bizarre issue of meaning and pedantics, like to two philosophers arguing over the concept of morality.It's like they had a complete disconnect from the humane issue behind same sex marriage."

csjeq4k,,> They are covering it in a pretty unbiased manner....now that it's Federal law
csjgebk,HarryPFlashman,"Your descriptions is not quite accurate. Their news is less biased but is subtlety biased enough to help set up the talking heads later.It is expertly produced propaganda.Since you won't believe me let me try to use an uncomfortable analog which has an application based on today's ruling. Anal Sex. Lets say you are trying to convince your significant other to engage in anal sex but he or she is not entirely comfortable with the idea. So you start out slow- by making a joke, or comment about hearing about and see if he or she reacts, then you get a little more overt- like hey everyone has tried this great thing called anal sex, then now that you are talking about anal sex you really bring out the big guns- LUBE, planning for anal sex, discussing when and how. Then next thing you know you are having anal sex and if you were the reticent party you wonder- hey how did I end up here having anal sex.Subtle baby steps, one little bit at a time. Thats how.And that my friend is how Fox news works."

csji6dr,BeardedForHerPleasur,"You can be Centrist, Libertarian, Socialist, Anarchist, or half-and half when it comes to social/fiscal concerns. The terms liberal and conservative are flawed because many often beliefs championed by one side have nothing to do with each other. Tying a nuanced set of political opinions to a binary system simply doesn't make a lot of sense. Think of it like the color spectrum. Some people are red, blue, orange, teal, purple, burgundy, green. Why would you lump all those colors as part of another somewhat related color? Just because orange is closer to red than blue on the color wheel, doesn't make it red. What about the people like me who are halfway between, depending on the issue/day. It wouldn't make any sense to say I'm red or blue. Because I'm not. I'm purple. And that's how we should be representing ourselves.Ninja edit: What I'm saying is that we should define our political identity by individual issues, not lump ourselves in with one group because we are slightly closer to it."

I've seen the shitfits that Fox News throws, and I've seen the sort of garbage they put out in the name of ""Fair and Balanced."" And let's not forget, they literally went to court to defend their right to misrepresent the facts in their reports.So don't tell me anything about preconceived notions. That channel and its leadership has being doing nothing but cementing its position as a radical right wing propaganda outlet for a decade and a half."

csjg4ct,ResonantOne,"Preconceived implies having thoughts without evidence or justification.

csjiiig,The_Captain_Spiff,most redditors' views of FNC are based on what jon stewart told them
csjf02l,massive_cock,Bingo. There are some ignorant loudmouths on FNC who are guilty of plenty. But the network does happily employ plenty of talking heads who aren't as terrible as the others.
csjgzrh,natophonic2,"There was a point a few years back when I started watching FNC during lunch, because at that time slot, they were really just reading the AP wire content, and they were better than the other news channels in that they'd read more of it instead of some hackneyed summary.

csjej2d,Reddit_DPW,They should get gay married
csjemzf,sir_snufflepants,"Ah, armchair lawyers who have never read a Supreme Court opinion but parrot what they hear anyway.Interesting you don't hear these people making the same statements about Brennan and Marshall, who used to walk arm in arm down the Court's hallways."
csjezc4,Peanutbutta33,So Clarence Thomas doesn't follow on the same side as Scalia on most of the court's decision? No one is bringing up Thurgood Marshall because he's been dead for over 20 years. So it makes sense when discussing the SC's most recent decision that we discuss the Justices currently on the bench.
csjglhd,sir_snufflepants,"Not really. It's a criticism aimed at delegitimizing Thomas -- something that would be considered racist were he a liberal -- but it's never a criticism thrown at Stevens, Brennan or anyone else.Regardless, do you know the voting records of Scalia and Thomas? Do you know when and how they've disagreed? Read their dissents and majority opinions?"
csjhcy1,Peanutbutta33,http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/24/upshot/24up-scotus-agreement-rates.html?_r=0&abt=0002&abg=1They Thomas agrees with Scalia 91% of the time I think that's pretty frequent agreement. Thomas has been Supreme Court justice for over 20 years I have no doubt they've disagreed on issues but it's disingenuous to suggest that of the long-term justices (meaning 20 years plus) they aren't similar idealogues. Plus my aunt worked with Justice Thomas when he was at the EEOC and said he was a bastard.
csjj6gp,taco_whisperer,"They're both just rigid constructualist, especially Thomas"
csjke6a,sir_snufflepants,"> I think that's pretty frequent agreementNo one disputes that they agree. The issue is what their agreement *means*.Their agreement in most issues is used as a way to delegitmize their positions without actually evaluating their position. It's used to show they walk in lockstep, implying one merely follows the other. It ignores that they both have similar views on construction and interpretation of the law.The reason they agree -- and Justices like Brennan and Stevens always agreed -- is because of their constitutional outlook."
csjnrii,Peanutbutta33,"Actually you responded with ""not really"" when I questioned whether Justices Scalia and Thomas fall on the same side of the court's rulings.Now you're agreeing that yes they do have similar voting records. Thomas delegitimatize his position before he became a Justice with the Anita Hill scandal. Whether you believe Thomas was innocent of sexual harassment that whole ordeal tainted his image. Additionally he went over 7 years without asking a single question during oral arguments, and rarely writes the majority opinion. Saying Thomas is a Constructionist does nothing to prove he's not Scalia's puppet."
csjp3jm,sir_snufflepants,">Actually you responded with ""not really"" when I questioned whether...It was in response to the entire post, the conclusion of which was, ""We don't talk about old justices because they aren't relevant."">Thomas delegitimatize his position before he became a Justice with the Anita Hill scandalNot really. Whether Anita Hill lied or told the truth has no bearing on the legitimacy of his legal positions and court opinions.Ad hominems are never a good way to argue.>Additionally he went over 7 years without asking a single question during oral arguments, and rarely writes the majorityBecause oral arguments are focused on very narrowly drawn issues, and are rarely dispositive of the case, most cases being decided well in advance.>Saying Thomas is a Constructionist does nothing to prove he's not Scalia's puppet.Except it does. The fact that Scalia and Thomas have nearly identical views on the Constitution explains their concurrence.Was Brennan Marshall's puppet?"
csjvjh8,Peanutbutta33,Okay never said Marshall or past Justices were irrelevant but nice try. I did say that in light of today's decision and questionsn surrounding whether Thomas is a puppet past Justices will not be the focus.Justice Thomas was accused of sexual harrasment. Justice Thomas sits on the Supreme Court the very same Supreme Court that can be called to make decisions that shape sexual harassment laws in this country so exactly how is history not relevant to his impartiality on this issue? He didn't exactly pass with flying colors it was a 48/52 to vote obviously there was a great deal of doubt regarding Justice Thomas' appointment.Now you've explained the purpose of oral arguments do you not agree that the Justice's comments and writings lend court observers better insight into a Justice's thinking? Okay we've established Thomas is a Constructionist but his lack of writings and questioning is why people question whether he holds many thoughts independent of Scalia. I recognize that Thomas has fallen on different sides for certain issues however this is far and few between. Both Justice Scalia and Thomas have served for similar periods and Thomas votes 91% of the time with Scalia I would say that's pretty compelling.You keep bringing up Brennan to say he was Marshall's puppet I guess you're attempting to illustrate that Liberals can be puppets? It still does not prove or disprove that Thomas is a puppet.
cskl890,sir_snufflepants,">Okay never said Marshall or past Justices were irrelevantI quote, *""No one is bringing up Thurgood Marshall because he's been dead for over 20 years.""*.Hence, you believe they are irrelevant to this discussion.>I did say that in light of today's decision and questionsn surrounding whether Thomas is a puppet past Justices will not be the focus.And I said that this criticism is never levied at the liberal wing of the Court, whether they walk in lockstep or not.So, when reading cases like *Roe* or *Kelo* will you similarly dismiss the Court's decision because the liberals are puppets of each other?Of course not. Why? Because it's childish and absurd to use ad hominems to *refute* a legal opinion.>Justice Thomas sits on the Supreme Court the very same Supreme Court that can be called to make decisions that shape sexual harassment laws in this country so exactly how is history not relevant to his impartiality on this issue?Good thing sexual harassment is completely irrelevant to the discussion here.>He didn't exactly pass with flying colors it was a 48/52 to vote obviously there was a great deal of doubt regarding Justice Thomas' appointment.And the decision the Court handed down yesterday was 5-4. Is gay marriage an issue that hasn't passed with flying colors and is there therefore doubt about gay marriage's constitutional legitimacy?>Okay we've established Thomas is a Constructionist but his lack of writingsYou clearly aren't a lawyer.Out of all the Justices, you're more likely to read an independent dissent or concurrence from Thomas. Many other Justices simply sign their name to the majority or dissent and leave it at that.>Both Justice Scalia and Thomas have served for similar periods and Thomas votes 91% of the time with Scalia I would say that's pretty compelling.And Ginsburg and Souter have around a 90% agreement rate. So?>You keep bringing up Brennan to say he was Marshall's puppet I guess you're attempting to illustrate that Liberals can be puppets? It still does not prove or disprove that Thomas is a puppet.Nah. It's a test of your partisanship. Your unwillingness to levy an identical criticism at the liberals on the Court is telling about your viewpoint in general."

csjh74y,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,They are painting the conservatives as not homophobic and constantly bringing up how many democrats switched on gay marriage relatively recently.
csjhals,lostintransactions,"You are exactly the reason we are so polarized in this country, you have preconceived notions that are not based on any facts.Watch Fox news before you make a comment.They are covering it pretty well and many of their anchors are proponents.

csjhrqz,Eisnel,"The Fox News comment section is amusing. A bunch of conservative commenters are actually trying to take credit for this decision. A common refrain is: ""This is a Conservative Supreme Court, so therefore it's the Conservative Movement that gets credit for this step forward, not liberals."" Of course, that blissfully ignores the fact that four of the five conservative judges dissented."
csji5f6,ResonantOne,"Unfortunately that is the problem with Fox News because those are the people that they cater to. Yeah, they may not come straight out and say all gays should be put in cages on the air, but they put out enough slanted editorial material that they keep those people believing that their beliefs are somehow rational."

csjfedx,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"If you think that your personal religious beliefs should dictate secular laws that affect other people, sorry, you're a terrible person.

csjha6h,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"Do you honestly believe that religious people have the right, both legally and morally, to make and pass laws that make it illegal not to be a member/believer of their church/religion? There absolutely is something inherently wrong with enforcing your religious beliefs on non-believers. I think that believing murder is wrong *only because god told you not to kill people* makes you a terrible person, too. This isn't a gay marriage thing; the general principle of ""the only reason I act like a civilized person is because I'm afraid of hell"" reads ""I'm a terrible person"" to me.Thinking that gay marriage is wrong and being pissed off that it's legal are different things. If you disapprove of people doing it but think it's within their legal rights, that's one thing. If you disapprove of people doing it and think they shouldn't be allowed, that's very different."
csji09j,,[deleted]
csjiv6g,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"Democracy should supersede human rights? Are you listening to yourself here? Saying ""the people who vote have voted that we should oppress people"" is waaaaaaaay more similar to colonial Africa.I never said that it's the only reason, but go ahead and make baseless assumptions. It's a shame you haven't learned more since secondary school. I think that most religious people can find a non-religious reason why murder is wrong. Those that can't? Terrible people. If they could present a non-religious reason why gay marriage is wrong, I'd be glad to hear it.Of course I think that practice is different than theory, unless you're seriously suggesting we charge people for thoughtcrime. If these same religious people were arguing something along the lines of ""god says I can marry six two-year-old girls"", do you think their opinion would be just as valid? What if they said something like ""god says black people aren't acceptable to marry""? I don't think that ""god says so"" is a valid reason for depriving people of rights. Separation of church and state. Religious law is unacceptable to me; if something was truly wrong for everyone a better argument can be presented than ""god says so""."
csjg1ng,Therealmattu,"Would you feel the same about marriage to a goat or horse? I'm happy for gay couples about the legalization (though troubled about the precedent of the federal court forcing laws not covered by the constitution) but I think you are missunderstanding what he is saying. You can disagree with something and not try to actively prevent it. Someone who actively discriminates against homosexuals however...Edit:It seems most people think I am comparing homosexuality with beastiality and that is not the case; it could have been about eating pork, or skinny dipping for all it matters. I am taking a subject that I think most people look negatively on (beastiality) and using it as an example of how your personal beliefs can be completely opposed to an act but that doesn't mean you act on it. This is not about gay rights, it's about how someone can have an opposing view but not take action to stop it, and that simply having an opinion doesn't automatically label you as a horrible human being. What you think and what you do are two very different things and I wouldn't label someone that doesn't like homosexuality as a terrible person only because that is how they feel.That being said I have two gay aunts, whom I am the closest with in my family, and a good friend who is also gay. I have nothing against gay marriage and am happy for them."
csjgttu,sagmin,"Delete your comment. You're embarrassing yourself. Did you really compare bestiality to gay marriage? What a horrible, little human you are."
csjgagw,Kishkyrie,The bestiality comparison is incredibly disingenuous and starting your comment with that kinda discredits everything you're saying
csjg85v,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"Why do you have to compare gay people to animals? Do you literally not understand the difference between a consenting adult and an animal?If you honestly think that saying ""you're a terrible person if you try to enforce religious law in a secular nation"" makes me worse than someone actually trying to do that, you can fuck right off. I'm not criticizing anyone's beliefs, I'm criticizing the idea that religious beliefs should dictate secular law."
csjgqu6,Therealmattu,"Jesus Christ! I'm not comparing the act of beastiality to homosexual activities; I'm giving an extreme that I think nearly everyone would look down on to give an example of having a dissenting view on something while not actively trying to stop it. The focus point here is view does not equal action in this circumstance; you said having a religous view on a secular law would make you a terrible person and I gave an example (extreme one at that) of why that isn't so. The only difference being the dissenting view doesn't have to come from a religious one. The guy you posted to wasn't saying they wanted to tried to change the law, only that they disagreed with it.Like I said above I am happy for same-sex couples; I just don't hate everyone that opposed it. My aunts are gay, one of my best friends is gay; I am happy for them. (Though my aunts got married a couple years ago so this doesn't change their personal lives all that much)"
csjh0c6,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"Why would you compare the aunts and friends that you love to animals? It's a rude comparison and not even accurate enough to be relevant. You can oppose bestiality on moral & ethical grounds that are not religious; I haven't heard a single argument for opposing gay marriage that is rooted in secular morals/ethics.If it downright pisses you off that other people are having gay marriages and you don't believe that they should be legally allowed to have them... yeah, I think that qualifies as a terrible person. Thinking ""gay marriage isn't for me and I'll pray for their souls"" is an entirely different matter from thinking it needs to be illegal."
csjhfr1,Therealmattu,I made an edit that added to my original comment because it looks like most people are reading it like that and that wasn't the intent. I support gay marriage and am happy for them (as I originally said) but I won't label someone as a terrible person only because their personal beliefs are counter to mine. I took an extreme (beastiality) because it is something I think most people look down on (myself included) and used it as an example to show that people can disagree with something and not actively act out on it. Maybe I'm just terrible in my wording. /shrug
csjhoaa,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"The second you enforce them on other people, they aren't personal beliefs. For example, it's legal to hold the personal belief that a person deserves to get raped, but the second you try to enforce that belief it becomes illegal. Can't accept that I, myself, can do it? No value judgment. Can't accept that other people could do it? Terrible person. It's pretty much that simple for me.In the future, it would probably help your cause a lot if you didn't compare gay people to animals. It's rude and insulting, and isn't an educated, reasonable argument."
csji6g7,Therealmattu,"I agree with you, the moment you force your beliefs on others is when the line is crossed, but the people mentioned in the original comment didn't do this is why I was saying that doesn't make them a terrible person. Also I wans't comparing gay sex to animal sex, (though most people think I am) I was comparing personal beliefs against something you dislike and how it doens't make you a horrible person only because you have them. What you do with those beliefs is what I think does."
csjicaf,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"Don't make the comparison if you aren't willing to have people react to it. You compared animals to gay people; you can't really be offended that people find that offensive.To me, the word ""acceptable"" means that there is some level of enforcement. I might not like, for example, small children in libraries, but I accept it. If I said I find small children in libraries unacceptable, I think that would cross the line."
csjiwau,Therealmattu,"Not sure why you would think I am offended at people taking things differently from its intent; if I did I would have deleted the comment rather than trying to explain it. Again, I did not compare homosexuality with beastiality, I compared a religous view to homosexuality, to a secular one of beastiality. The reason I used beastiality is because I wanted to use an extreme that I was confident nearly everyone would have a negative view of it. In regards to the library thing I think the comparison would be closer to you finding children in the library as unacceptable to actively trying to rid the library of all children because you find it unacceptable."
csjj287,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"Yes, you did. I get that you weren't trying to say that they're both wrong/right, but you absolutely did compare them and it's not like I'm the only person that found it rude.I agree that trying to rid the world of gay people is unacceptable. I just don't think that you can refuse to accept the legalization of gay marriage without supporting religious law."
csjjmxm,Therealmattu,"I understand that most people took it that way but no it is not what I did. I compared view points of two different acts, not the two acts themselves; though this seems a small distinction it is in fact a rather large one. I'm sorry if I offended you, and many others, but it was not the intent nor what I wrote; it's just what people took it to be.I get why people would be angry from what I wrote if they took it a certain way, and I'll bet some people would be mad even if they immediately understood my meaning. While I am sad people took it differently than I intended, I am rather happy at all the support behind this passing.I get what you are saying about not accepting legalization due to relgious law and I can agree with you on most of this. My only thing was that it doesn't mean the people resisting the change due to religious beliefs are all terrible people as a result of this; what they choose to do with those resistant feelings is what will label them in my mind. I'm truly hoping they eventually come to accept and begin to wonder why they were ever against having children in the library. :)"

csjo736,want_to_join,"Like what exactly? You are the one here pretending this issue is about something else. Is it not obvious to you? It should be. The CONTRACT of civil marriage is something the government regulates, like any other contract.Like I said, anyone who doesn't want the government involved, doesn't have to. You can throw a wedding for you and your hamburger if you want to, the government is simply not going to allow you to sign a contract with that hamburger.Your entire argument is a giant strawman.Stop pretending that the conservative bigotry we have been fighting for the last twenty years is something else. No one here is going to believe your lie."

And their children will carry remnants of their bigotry for another hundred years.It won't be for about 150 years that the anti-gay marriage views of today start to finally die. And the laws they passed post-SCOTUS ruling that look to restrict gay marriage will be weird-quriky laws that nobody takes seriously anymore, like how common law marriage is still on the books in a lot of states.150 years from now two dudes might be getting married outside somewhere, and a younger family member might joke about it; ""Do you know that its technically illegal to for you two to get married within 500ft of a school?""Then someone will be like ""That's dumb, that literally doesn't make any sense at all.""Source: My 96 year old grandmother was raised in a multi-generational household.

Because you feel it's unnatural, Granted yeah gay sex kills my boner and kinda grosses me out (not lesbian stuff though) But it's not my place to meddle in the lives of strangers. In this world it's to each his own and too your own people. Gay folks aren't my people but i am not about to tell them how to live their lives. Because if i was a praying man (I'm an atheist) but i am pretty sure Jesus wouldn't like one person condemning another based on who they are. If you are going to rage against something.. make it some thing worth fighting against. Like child molesters.. Seriously fuck those guys."
csjre0b,ShadowWhoWalks,How would it affect people's life after a few generations?What message would it send and have then?Marriage lost its message that monogamous stable relationship is the best environment for any child to born (hence why any sort of governament would invest money in promoting an INTERpersonal relationship).
csjrm9h,Darkromani,What the fuck are you talking about?
csjta7o,Mic71,Or maybe traditional straight marriage isn't the only environment where a child can grow safe and sane...
csjttm7,ShadowWhoWalks,"@Dark I am talking about my observation that your statement seems short-sighted.@Mic True, but a good evaluation involves looking at the general and common case, rather than the idealized scenario. Furthermore, such an environment is neutral rather than good. The circumstances for an alternative environment involves either tragedy or child trafficking and treating children as a commodity such as a house or a car."
csju4dz,Mic71,A really good evaluation involves looking at each case individually. And using a kid as a commodity or a weapon is nothing new. Lots of traditional marriages use them that way at Family Courts.
csk3rol,atomicxblue,"What about the single parents who are able to raise stable children? It's difficult for the parent, but families come in all different shapes."
cskgikr,ShadowWhoWalks,"Good for them, but it is better to encourage the statistically much safer option.Some heroic single parents are able to succeed, but single parenting tends to come from a tragedy such as divorce or a parent's death (which can bring the child trauma), hence it is not inherently a good thing, but a response to a tragedy which may bring positive or negative results."

csjra2v,ShinakoX2,"So one of the biggest arguments I've heard against gay marriage in the past is that churches who refuse to perform gay marriages could be penalized. Is there any possibility of that happening with this new event, or was that just fear-mongering?"
csjreex,TacticianRobin,"Fear mongering. Churches are protected under the 1st Amendment, always have been always will be. The civil contact of marriage is completely separate from the religious sanctity of marriage. You can be legally married in the eyes of the state but not the church, and vice versa."
csjrbve,rutefoot,Fear mongering. We've had equality for a while in Canada and there's never been such talk
csjrxwk,loki8481,Churches have long refused to marry people for lots of reasons. this ruling won't change any of that precedent.
csjs01s,macaco_gordinho,"So the arguement is that a pastor performs a ""religious ceremony"" but that isn't the legal part. The legal part is the documentation that he signs declaring the marriage legal. Technically it is a power vested in them by the government and cannot be used discriminitively (idk if i spelled that right). However, regardless if it is the law, I don't think anyone would force someone to the point of a lawsuit to sign the docs. I mean if that it would happen, then a priest could just revoke his own ability to sign the paper and just perform the ceremonny on religious grounds period. Then those who perform the ceremony would have a notary present and sign the doc."
csjrpu7,,"What I predict will happen is that some militants (few and far between as they may be) will attempt to DEMAND that a particular church perform their ceremony and then raise a ruckus if and when that particular church declines. Granted, 99.99% of couples that are affected by this ruling aren't trolls and just want the same partnership benefits that male/female partnerships get (basically, all the legal things associated with being ""married"") and aren't going to go out and look for trouble just to rub it in the face of the uber-conservatives. But there's going to be at least 5-10 couples nationwide over the next 2 years (conservative -heh- estimate) that are going to go looking for trouble just to be smug. I don't see anything coming of it other than a sensationalized story, though."
csjrjgu,Adub137,"It makes me absolutely furious that any rational human being would take to Facebook to bitch about how unconstitutional this decision is. All it is, is a bunch of assholes bitching about how someone else was just given the same rights that they've had their whole life. If your religion or moral compass tells you that another human being does not deserve the same rights as you, then you need to find a new f***ing religion (or set of moral guidelines)."
csjrr5f,macaco_gordinho,it's just people who hear words and think they understand the law my friend. They want their religion to be absolute and nothing else before it. Beliefs are strong. They change landscapes. The only problem is that most people are on the wrong side of the issues.

csjskt4,bcsimms04,So you think it's fine to deny people a basic right that everyone else has? You realize that this is why the supreme court exists right? It exists to help determine if laws passed by people or elected officials are constitutional. The supreme court today found that laws that ban same sex marriage are unconstitutional.

It's an institution of legal precedent, justice, checks & balances, and constitutional interpretation. Looking back, The ruling in Brown v.

csjg6kr,chiperific_on_reddit,"If you give gay people the right to marryThey're going to ask to file their taxes jointly.When they're filling out their W-9 at work, They're going to ask for spousal benefits.When you give them equal benefits, they're probably going to want hospital visitation rights, too.While they're visiting each other in the hospital, they'll think about their need for joint insurance coverage.When they get joint home, health and auto insurance coverage, they'll start planning a road trip together.Then they'll want their marriage to be recognized in every state they travel to.While they're on vacation, they'll see a family with young children at the beach.Then they'll want the right to care for and raise a child.But before they can adopt a child, they'll want joint parenting and equal family status.Then, when their children are grown, they'll start thinking about inheritance rights.And, when they have been given the legal right to shape their lives and plan their futures like straight couples…Zorp the Surveyor will arise from the earth and burn your flesh off with his volcano mouth."

csjgqw3,BoratRemix,I don't think you understand the legal system bro.
csjnlc2,ShouldBeAnUpvoteGif,I think you might not know what you're talking about. They had to pass a constitutional amendment to ban alcohol yet no such amendment has ever been passed banning drug use. The tenth amendment states that any powers not explicitly enumerated in the constitution are by default left to the states. The feds insist their law trumps the states even though the constitution says nothing at all about drug use. As I stated above if the constitution doesn't explicitly state that the power lies with the feds then the states must decide yet most states have banned it because of the federal law not because the states independently decided that was the case. Federal prohibition without a constitutional amendment is by definition unconstitutional and is completly within the scope of scotus.
csjppw6,BoratRemix,"I'm going to be 100% honest with you. I'm not going to read that because I don't care about your opinion lol. I'm sorry if that makes me ignorant or if I deserve lots of downvotes, I'm just trying to be real with you."

csjha3c,SaxifrageRussel,"There is an even richer history of not letting people drink, arresting them for it, making it illegal for voting citizens to consume etc."

csjr074,SaxifrageRussel,It is 100% constitutional to prohibit or regulate drugs.
csjkqud,ShouldBeAnUpvoteGif,I wouldn't call 13 years a rich history .
csjr3o7,SaxifrageRussel,"Prohibition is a mere blip on the laws against drinking. No liquor sales on Sunday or after midnight, dry counties, open container laws, drunk in public, 21 for drinking age, etc."

csjgmu8,scottevil110,It would have to be some MUCH wider ruling that libertarianism is basically the way to go on everything. That's the only way they could rule to legalize any substance is by saying that basically the government has no right to tell you what to do.

csjkil8,ShouldBeAnUpvoteGif,Citizens aren't going to vote on legislation if that's what you mean. And given the history of local ballots being overuled by the feds or even state authorities I don't think that's the best way to go.

csjh0uo,,I don't know if that issue is within the scope of the SCOTUS. I could be wrong though.
csjermd,Themonkeylifter,SCOTUS plz
csjfk9w,dakatabri,"I mean whatever your opinion is on legalization, I think there's no doubt that it's constitutionally permissible for the government to legislate it. I'm not sure what you think the Supreme Court would do."
csjfykd,owa00,"That's probably a horrible idea since if it gets shot down it could be a very big blow to the movement. I remember reading the gay rights movement steered away from an all in approach like this. Instead they first tried to convince the public/states to adopt it and create a snowball effect that would eventually lead to a SCOTUS decision. Let's not kid ourselves though, the judges are a bit biased deep down. No judge wants to be remembered as the judge that banned gay marriage when the states had already begun adopting it as law. It's the same as slavery/voting rights. If those judges/lawmakers had the hindsight to see how those laws would be seen today they would change their opinion. Same thing happened with gay marriage. The judges saw the writing on the wall, and knew that this was coming one way or another. Sure it was a 5-4 decision, but those dissenting 4 probably thought about it just a bit more than they would normally have done because of the way the states were adopting it. These 5 judges are now heroes to some, specially that 5th vote."
csjjyr6,skeach101,Why just Marijuana? What's the argument against ALL drugs?
csjmblf,ShouldBeAnUpvoteGif,I personally favor complete legalization. They did it in Honduras IIRC and crime rates and drug use plummeted.

csjfhlu,greencoinman,"But, then my state will no longer be the coolest :("
csjfz4d,thebig2814,Keep dreaming pal
csjgecb,UncleMeat,The federal marijuana ban is almost certainly constitutional. The courts isn't the right place to end the drug war.
csjgflr,NandalRewman,"The time isn't right yet. We need more recreational states to have the momentum, not to mention someone has to bring the case to the court. I'd say if they don't do it this year though, it won't be far into the next."
csjgq9v,jimbo831,"While I am all for marijuana legalization, it is absolutely not a Supreme Court issue. What part of the Constitution do you believe gives you the right to use drugs?"
csjn1ke,ShouldBeAnUpvoteGif,I believe the 10th amendment states that any powers not explicitly given to the feds is by default the realm of the states. The constitution is silent when it comes to drug use so federal prohibition is by definition unconstitutional. Since the constitution says nothing about drugs any federal law is invalid since it must be left to the states. The fact that since the feds insist that their law trumps the states I believe we have unconstitutional prohibition of drug use. That's what.Edit: all you have to do is look at the fact that the only way they could prohibit alcohol was through passing a constitutional amendment. No such amendment has ever been passed prohibiting drugs. Therefore this is absolutely a scotus issue.
csjn6nt,jimbo831,"That is an argument against federal prohibition, but not for state legalization. Keep in mind it is still illegal in most states. I'm not sure if the argument is legally valid or not, as I'm not a lawyer, but the federal government has a lot of laws for a lot of reasons. Your argument is the same one Republicans used to fight against Obamacare last year, but they lost because SCOTUS decided that fell under the commerce clause. There may be some similar legal justifications for federal drug prohibition. I'd actually be really interested to hear a take from a lawyer familiar with these laws."
csjno0m,ShouldBeAnUpvoteGif,Calling any lawyers... I agree. I want to know what a lawyer thinks as well.
csjfpm1,splein23,No that would change money flow and we can't have that. Until then we'll just get non-money related laws. I guess the ACA is money related but it's not exactly screwing the rich and powerful.

csjf9uk,juicius,"I'm actually surprised at the emotional response I'm having at this decision. I support marriage equality and have so for many years.

It makes me guilty that I didn't make myself clearer and have *done* something, I don't know, write a Congressman or hold up a sign, all these years I told myself that I support marriage equality. I am sorry, so deeply sorry, that this took this long for you. Perhaps in the deepest recess of my mind, I knew that this didn't affect me, that I'd be able to get married whenever I want to the girl I love, and in fact, I am married. I was complacent and I didn't do enough, or really, I didn't do anything. Again, I am very sorry, and I am incredibly happy for you."

csju59z,slagwa,"After reading Scalia's dissent I have only one thing to say. If you truly feel this way, that the nations Supreme Court is an select, patrician, highly unrepresentative panel of nine well educated individuals who are motivated more by their politics then the law. That they aren't in a position to make a decision to uphold the 14th amendment. Then you've clearly lost any confidence and trust in the Court. And if your such a big part of something that you can't believe in and have lost such faith in, then do the nation a favor and **resign**."
csjufy2,aresef,Why would he resign from a lifetime appointment? I mean I'm not saying Scalia isn't unhinged and I'm not saying Justices should not have lifetime appointments. But he's not obliged to do a thing.Edit: He can be impeached. But not for being a lunatic.

csjgiga,scottevil110,Agreed. Just because I disagree about the role of government doesn't change anything about the fact that it's bound to treat everyone equally. I'd be every bit as happy if they ruled that straight marriage was unconstitutional. The point is that everyone is treated the same.

He said Love One Another.Religion didn't make them homophobic, uncertainty about their own sexuality made them homophobic. Most straight Christians I know, myself included, are celebrating today.Was it religion that made inter-racial marriage illegal or was it bigotry?"
csjgza1,Dr894,"Bigotry mostly caused by religion. They think beliving in a deity gives them the right to judge other people. I never said all Christians are against it.

We will have much more analysis of the ruling later, but here is NOM's statement that we just moments ago issued to the media:* * * * * * * * * *>Though expected, today's decision is completely illegitimate. We reject it and so will the American people. It represents nothing but judicial activism, legislating from the bench, with a bare majority of the Justices on the Supreme Court exercising raw political power to impose their own preferences on marriage when they have no constitutional authority to do so. It is a lawless ruling that contravenes the decisions of over 50 million voters and their elected representatives. It is a decision that is reminiscent of other illegitimate Court rulings such as Dred Scott and Roe v Wade and will further plunge the Supreme Court into public disrepute.>Make no mistake about it: The National Organization for Marriage (NOM) and countless millions of Americans do not accept this ruling. Instead, we will work at every turn to reverse it.>The US Supreme Court does not have the authority to redefine something it did not create. Marriage was created long before the United States and our constitution came into existence. Our constitution says nothing about marriage. The majority who issued today's ruling have simply made it up out of thin air with no constitutional authority.>In his ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail,"" Dr. Martin Luther King discussed the moral importance of disobeying unjust laws, which we submit applies equally to unjust Supreme Court decisions. Dr. King evoked the teaching of St. Thomas Aquinas that an unjust law or decision is one that is ""a human law that is not rooted in eternal law or natural law."">Today's decision of the Supreme Court lacks both constitutional and moral authority. There is no eternal or natural law that allows for marriage to be redefined.>This is not the first time that the Supreme Court has issued an immoral and unjust ruling. In 1857, the Court ruled in the infamous Dred Scott v Sandford case that African Americans could not become citizens of the United States and determined that the government was powerless to reject slavery. In 1927 the Court effectively endorsed eugenics by ruling that people with mental illness and other ""defectives"" could be sterilized against their will, saying ""three generations of imbeciles are enough."" And in Roe v Wade, the Court invented a constitutional right to abortion by claiming it was an integral element of the right to privacy. Over 55 million unborn babies have died as a result.>We urge the American people and future presidents to regard today's decision just as President Abraham Lincoln regarded the Dred Scott ruling when he said in his first inaugural address that ""if the policy of the government upon vital questions, affecting the whole people, is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made…the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal."">Today's decision is by no means the final word concerning the definition of marriage; indeed it is only the beginning of the next phase in the struggle. NOM is committed to reversing this ruling over the long term and ameliorating it over the short term. Specifically:>We call on Congress and state governments to move immediately to protect the rights of people who believe in the truth of marriage from being discriminated against by passing the First Amendment Defense Act through Congress, and similar legislation in the various states.We also call on Congress to advance to the states for consideration a proposed constitutional amendment defining marriage in the law as it has existed in reality for the entirety of our nation's existence – the union of one man and one woman.We call on the American people to make the definition of marriage a pivotal issue in the 2016 presidential contest and to elect a president who will be a true champion for marriage, one who is committed to taking specific steps to restoring true marriage in the law including appointing new justices to the Supreme Court who will have the opportunity to reverse this decision.NOM will work tirelessly along with allies to help change the culture so that Americans have a better understanding of the importance of marriage to children, families and society as a whole.While today's decision of the Supreme Court is certainly disappointing, it is not demoralizing to those of us who fervently believe in the truth of marriage and its importance to societal flourishing. Indeed, the decision will be energizing. Just as the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v Wade infused the pro-life movement with new energy and commitment, so too will the decision today reawaken the American people to join the marriage movement.>Our prayer for America is that today's injustice can be corrected quickly, sparing the nation decades of anguish of the kind that has followed the Court's decision in Roe."

csk8otx,demthunderchiefs,A great unintended side effect of this is that Presidential candidates will have to focus on more important issues. Republicans can't use being against gay marriage as a campaign point. And Democrats might not automatically carry the gay vote. Interesting.

csk95hb,AfghanHokie,"I agree. I'm a religious person, but I also realize that govt shouldn't play a role in religion. The separation of Church and State is why I can go to my mosque and practice my religion in peace, despite all the hate it gets in certain parts of this country. That's why I loved this ruling, because it reinforces my beliefs that the govt. shouldn't play a role and discriminate against a minority, because of the religious beliefs of the majority. Over time we will all at one time or another find ourselves the minority and should be thankful we have a system in place that will protect us from the majority.

csjwazk,penguin74,"OK, SCOTUS, next case to be heard is, legalized marijuana. Do it!"
csjwjle,iateyourcake,"The Supreme Court just caught up with most of us, and now America is proven to have a shred of human decency."
csjwqup,lolamp33,"caught up? - if this was majority popular, then this should have been a constitutional AMENDMENT - not a supreme court rulingthe fact the supreme court can not simply determine legality of law, but can MAKE law is kind of ridiculous (though I think gay marriage is a good thing for the country)"
csjx0pn,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"The constitution doesn't need amending, it already defended the rights of gays to be married."
csjx3vk,lolamp33,"not really - I doubt the founding fathers were super enthused about gay peoplethe constitution allows gay marriage, like the bible allows christians to not burn heathens at the stake - its just culture has changed, so our ""interpretation"" has changed with it (though not EVERY ones interpretation is the same, which is why its better for elected representatives to weigh in, when it comes to law creation)"

csjyxeq,Taters233,"I read way too many nutty political forums. It has been extremely refreshing to come here and see so much support for the LGBT community and gay marriage. And no one calling the supreme court ""traitors that are shredding the Constitution"". Thank you Reddit community for reminding me that there really are many sane voters."
csjyzd6,,"""Sane voters""Oh? Remind me again how exactly you went about voting for your Supreme Court Justices."
csjz5z5,Taters233,"I did not say that we voted for justices. I was saying I am happy there are so many sane voters out there. Sometimes when I get too deep into some of the nutty forums out there, it becomes quite apparent that many voters are paranoid and hyperbolic conspiracy nuts. I was not really seeing any of them today on the upvoted stories about this Supreme court ruling on Reddit. It reminded me that, especially with younger voters, there are sane and rational people. What did you think I meant?"
csjz9y7,,"Well, for one, assuming that any dissenting opinion is ""insane"" is pretty bold.But what I mean is that the vast majority of the echo chamber on Reddit didn't vote. They are either too young to have voted for Obama's first presidential election, or they are politically apathetic when it comes to voting. Even if they had voted, the Supreme Court Justices aren't elected, and shouldn't be beholden to popular opinion in the first place.Of course, this isn't how things work in the real world, apparently. The Supreme Court's majority opinion even specifically mentions how the decision is based more on ""cultural momentum"" than on the actual legal interpretation of the bill in question / the original purpose of the non-elected Supreme Court."
cskq4ae,Taters233,"It is not too terribly bold to say that those voters who believe that Obama is secretly a Kenyan trying to establish a fascist Sharia law state in this country are insane. The same voters who think that somehow allowing gay marriage will lead to the breakdown of American society. When it comes to this stuff they are nutty. The Supreme Court interprets law according to the current times, not according to the times of 1786. Thus the ""cultural momentum"". Just like other Civil Rights movements. This seems to be what you perceive as being beholden to popular opinion. There is a great quote out there by Thomas Jefferson that speaks to this, that it would be silly and foolish to make things like the constitution immutable.Also, go read the dissenting views of Scalia and such. Huge lack of rational there.So, you are not much of a fan of this?"

csjefw1,helpmeredditimbored,"The news just came out, more info will be provided as time passes"
csjibnd,emptyvoices,I'm impressed the dissenting 4 were able to bang out a 64 page opinion so quickly. While I've been working on a 20 page report on our improving our plants production of a chemical for 2 weeks.
csjefxj,blue_lagoon,They just released the ruling ten minutes ago. We'll get that info in the later need reports
csjegef,woofwoofdog99,considering the opinions came out about 5 minutes ago I can't fault them for not reading the [100+ page opinions](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf) yet.
csjegri,geelinz,"The opinion came out like 1 minute before the article. Anyway. 5-4, libs and Kennedy. 4 dissenting opinions."
csjeg6t,iseeaseaanemone,I'm assuming the ruling just came down so news outlets are short on details. I can't wait for the details too!
csjeg8v,,"Details come later. What is sadly most important, is getting the headline up so you can get the clicks, before somebody else does."
csjehig,uncannylizard,The news is like 10 minutes old.
csjegx2,,The report was published minutes ago. The media gets the important part - legal in all 50 states - and then worries about the rest afterword. Being first to report is better than being last with all the info.
csjeh8t,Eslader,It just happened. They probably had two articles ready to go to cover either possible decision so they could publish immediately. Now they'll look at the decision and flesh out the details in the real article that comes later.
csjeivw,Caedus,"I assume ""breaking news"" is a foreign concept to you? It literally just happened."
csjejzj,Sports-Nerd,"There just getting the details still. I don't remember the exact rules, but I'm pretty sure the Supreme Court has rules banning cell phone use and stuff like that. I think the news got out with people running out of the court doors to the crowd. Also it was 5-4, Kennedy was the swing vote and I believe he wrote the majority opinion (maybe, not sure). News is still developing. Edit: Kennedy based it off the overturning of laws banning interracial marriage, and the past laws against same-sex marriage negatively effected children of those couples."

csjeudp,Not_An_Ambulance,"This is pretty typical. Expect those articles later in the day. This was announced probably less than 5 minutes before the article was published, they were racing each other to publish.Also, they will typically announce the ruling before the opinion is actually available to read, which will have all the details - down to which older cases they've decided to creatively interpret to explain how this is just a clarification of an existing law.Edit: accidentally a word"

csjej2q,dikipedia,A sound of a million Conservative screams being heard across America right now
csjeu80,Omnibrad,I'm a conservative and not screaming. Many conservatives wanted this ruling.

csjf1v3,rabbittexpress,"You may be closer to a libertarian then... ;)Conservative on Economic issues, Liberal on Social issues... :P"
csjfbbp,Omnibrad,I'm not a libertarian. I'm a moderate conservative who doesn't hate gay people.
csjm05p,,So you're not socially liberal in general?
csjhaer,warchant,"I don't think people get this at all. The label conservative has been so over generalized that I almost hate saying it anymore, when fundamentally, that's what I am."
csjj4hd,theredgreenmage,It's because most popular main stream conservatives in the USA are anti gay. It's like asking why so many people think liberals are for social services.

csjjqnh,Razlyk,"It's as if a million tiny conservative voices cried out at once, and then were silenced."
csjhagt,Ethanol_Based_Life,I am a conservative in that I don't want the government interfering with stuff. Banning services to a particular group is interfering. Therefore I'm pretty happy with the decision
csjesqi,Xdes,This is going to be the greatest era of conservative policy since Roe v. Wade.
csjfakn,Caboose106,"Probably fewer than you'd think. Am conservative, and have been wanting this for a long time."
csjfa56,,[deleted]
csjfpw4,Testiclese,"I'm not interested in ""helping"" you. I'm glad you're losing your battles, that's all. You've been on the losing side of history for a while now. The same sort who wanted to deny gay people their right to happiness are the same who wanted to prevent women from voting, keep blacks as slaves, the same who used religious demagoguery to burn ""witches"" at the stake, and the same who threatened Galileo. The centuries change, but ""conservative values"" have always tried (and eventually have lost) to hold humanity back. Healthcare, abortion, gay marriage, it just keeps coming, doesn't it? How does it feel?Zero sympathy for you."
csjge7e,weasleman0267,As a Conservative I see the government trying to say who can and can't be married as an afront to my beliefs that government should be small and have no say in who I can marry. As a Conservative I am very excited to hear the news that homosexuals can now marry the person they love
csjg7eh,Veloci-Tractor,"haha, oh woe is you"
csjed98,Shim_Hutch,"I'm disappointed that it was only a 5-4 decision. Those 4 should be ashamed of themselves.Edit: For everyone saying ""Those 4 just believe it should be up to the states to decide""...Should we have left individual states decide whether slavery was okay or not? We fought a war over that one. ""States Rights"" sounds like a good excuse, but there are some backwards states in this country (you know, like the ones who are just now thinking about removing the Confederate flag), that would do some awful shit if they could all make their own rules regarding how people (Muslims, Blacks, LGBTs, Hispanics, etc) are allowed to legally be discriminated against.Sometimes you need the highest court in the land to make a tough decision to guarantee equal rights to all people. Those 4 say that states should be allowed to decide whether to discriminate or not."
csjeiw0,Someone_Care,"Their job is not to uphold what they think is right, but to uphold what they believe to be constitutional. Certainly this doesn't always happen, but I don't think it's that simple.Edit: a word"
csjevbr,CurlingPornAddict,"I doubt that all 4 voted no based on moral opinion. I think it had to do with the issue being left to individual states to decide, instead of being all encompassing."
csjf0j1,Someone_Care,"Agreed, and I personally wouldn't be surprised if the Chief justice actually supported gay marriage. I'm not saying that's the case, but I think its not unreasonable to suppose."
csjf8fm,Reead,"Reading his dissent, he does seem to support the idea of gay marriage, he just believes it isn't a constitutional issue. A reasonable opinion."
csjgvog,,Actually I got the opposite impression from his dissent. He deliberately shoehorned stuff about historic definition of marriage into his dissent. He didn't need to do that. His point about state's rights have nothing to do with historic definitions of marriage. It seems to me like he's got strong moral judgement on the issue but is doing his best to hide it.
csjmjjm,IAMA_cheerleader,"really? it read to me like he was saying ""if someone wants to use the historical definition of marriage, that doesn't make them immediately irrational"" and like he was saying that letting people change public opinion to make marriage equality happen would be a better long term result and reduce prejudices more than trying to hand down a court order saying ""yeah we don't care if you're on the fence, we're now telling you what to do"".after all, some people who are on the fence on any issue will be put off by being told what to do and pushed away from your side."
csjesq0,Minnesota_MiracleMan,"When everyone is operating under this decision 'legalizing' Same Sex Marriage, then I think OP has a point. But when they didn't legalize anything, just stating that the 14th Amendment doesn't ban same sex marriages, OP is dead wrong. The 4 against very well could see that the language in the 14th Amendment does restrict Same Sex marriage, even if they believe it shouldn't. That would have been a different process."
csjf5pt,lawtown,"This is 100% right. If you read Robert's dissent he makes it very clear that his opinion is that it is not a fundamental right and should be left to the state legislatures. While I disagree, his interpretation isn't based solely on bigotry (in my opinion). Scalia on the other hand.... Either way, a huge win for the country today."
csjf8ff,Someone_Care,Glad to see someone who agrees with me haha- all the way around.
csjer6h,,"Not calling you out, because I see where you are coming from. But I find it hard to believe they interpret the constitution as ONLY allowing marriage between a man and a woman. There definitely has to be some beliefs influencing them."
csjf1r5,Nevermore60,"The use of phrases like ""legalize gay marriage"" and ""ban gay marriage"" has clouded the issue, but the question was never whether the constitution ""ALLOWS"" gay marriage, as you say. The question was whether the 14th Amendment *requires states to recognize* same-sex marriages. The common thread of the dissenting opinions will likely be: ""yeah, gay marriage is fine, but there's just nothing in the constitution that requires states to recognize it (or any marriage for that matter).""Not saying I agree with this interpretation, just trying to lay it out as best I can.From the first dissent:> Although the policy arguments for extending marriage to same-sex couples may be compelling, the legal arguments for requiring such an extension are not. The fundamental right to marry does not include a right to make a State change its definition of marriage. And a State's decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational. In short, our Constitution does not enact any one theory of marriage. The people of a State are free to expand marriage to include same-sex couples, or to retain the historic definition.> Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step of ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex marriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority's approach is deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens—through the democratic process—to adopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept."
csjhb0c,pab_guy,"The same argument could be made against states recognizing interracial marriages. The lack of intellectual rigor, to not see how this will be viewed through the lens of future's history is pretty amazing. The wrong side of history just feels so right to these people..."
csjhyqq,Nevermore60,States *should* be required to recognize interracial marriage. States *should* be required to recognize gay marriage.But the argument is not unreasonable that we should just amend the damn Constitution to say things like this rather than pretending that that meaning has somehow been baked into the 14th Amendment for the last 150 years all along.
csjld3r,pab_guy,"Depends on whether you take an originalist approach or not. I don't particularly care one way or the other, as I don't think you can say either approach is rock solid. regardless, laws will keep up with society one way or another. Whether we amend the constitution or reinterpret it in modern light just doesn't concern me that much...But some people prefer a more solid footing for the law, I get that. I just think if you look deep enough, all we have is our agreed upon interpretations anyway."
csjlol2,Nevermore60,"I'd generally be more comfortable democratically amending our laws, as opposed to entrusting what amounts to a supreme legislative process to nine non-elected life-term judges."
csjjo6z,iCUman,"As compelling as that argument may be, the reality of the situation is that the 14th amendment requires equal protection. States cannot both honor out-of-state marriage licenses and deny them at the same time. This has always been a central issue with the ban on gay marriage in certain states, and SCOTUS was right in hearing the case, because that's exactly what they are charged to do.The fact that the dissenting arguments focus on ""judicial activism"" instead of laying out actual arguments that would support the notion that a state could both honor and dishonor legal documents at the same time, tells me that even these justices know how ridiculous such a concept would be."
csjkly4,Nevermore60,"If the 14th amendment prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, then defining marriage as requiring one person of each sex is just plain old sex discrimination, subject to intermediate scrutiny under decades-old case law.No new 14A precedent really required..."
csjlozj,iCUman,"Well, not exactly. You could make the argument that both sexes have equal access to marriage, and therefore there is no discrimination.But that's not the heart of the issue. The heart of the issue is that states with a ban on same-sex marriage were invalidating out-of-state licenses (and the rights conveyed by them), despite recognizing traditional marriages from the same states, thereby creating a state of discrimination. If states banning same-sex marriage had also passed laws invalidating ALL out-of-state marriage licenses, same sex couples wouldn't be able to claim the right to equal protection.There's no federal law that requires states to recognize marriages performed in other states, but there's a reason these states did not take that specific avenue to fight same-sex marriage - it would have caused nightmares in their respective legal systems."
csjlrkx,Nevermore60,"> You could make the argument that both sexes have equal access to marriage, and therefore there is no discrimination.That argument would be incorrect.In states without same-sex marriage, men have the legal right to marry women, while women do not have the legal right to marry women. That's explicit sex-discrimination, plain as day."
csjm62o,iCUman,"That is the argument that same-sex couples have been making since day one. But again, I think that's mostly irrelevant. The decision hinges on the fact that states CANNOT treat two legal documents differently based solely on something like sex of the parties.To expand (since one of the main arguments is how this will ultimately result in people marrying turtles and entire towns becoming married to each other): if Utah passed a law allowing polygamous marriages, states that honor marriages performed in Utah have two choices: they can accept the marriages as legal and binding (which creates a de facto right for polygamous marriages in their own state) or they can refuse to honor ANY AND ALL marriages performed in Utah. They don't get to pick and choose which marriages they will honor and which they won't, as that would constitute discrimination."
csjgqqw,andreasmiles23,This. Im sure those 4 dissenters are fine with gays. They just don't think it's constitutionally sounds to say that states can't ban it.
csjgt45,Nevermore60,> They just don't think it's constitutionally sounds to say that states ~~can't ban it~~ are constitutionally required to grant it their legal imprimatur.Kind of an important difference.
csjjww5,,>Im sure those 4 dissenters are fine with gays.Bull. Fucking. Shit.
csjf130,EckhartsLadder,"That's not what they would have to find. It doesn't matter whether the constitution says that marriage is only allowed between a man and a woman, what's important is whether not allowing gays and lesbians to marry is unconstitutional."
csjhp61,ericphilbin,"More to the point, is the banning of such marriages unconstitutional? Apparently, yes, it is."
csjgav5,,"Yes, however, there are various interpretations of the law which invariably can be affected by the interpreter's personal emotions. The law is not an exact science."
csjhp6h,,"Exactly. I believe it was written in such a way that allows interpretation. That's kind of the genius behind it. Like its written in the majority,> The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.You're completely right, it's not an exact science."
csjij0s,IDontHaveSpinaBifida,"The only reason I'm upset with the ruling in any way is that I really wish they would have abolished marriage licenses instead. I think we would do better with just having a civil union option for couples that could include the benefits. I really think this would've been the best compromise. Either way, I'm happy that we're moving a step forward, even if it's on a different path than I'd hoped."
csjf1ko,BenaiahLionPwnr,Well they were interpreting if the BAN was constitutional or not the constitutions stance on marriage. It's of question of what the constitution can or cannot restrict. Obviously personal belief come into the equation but it's a grayer area.
csjf237,meeseeksanddestroy,"If anything, they were probably coming from the opinion that the government shouldn't have any say over marriage whatsoever,"
csjf4bn,,That's a very fair opinion.
csjfzza,refracture,"Eh, marriage has very real legal and tax ramifications. People who argue it's a purely religious thing are wrong."
csjgi1h,3_Thumbs_Up,"It does, but it shouldn't."
csjf6tx,meeseeksanddestroy,"It is on the surface, and it might work in the future, but the Supreme Court made the right decision for now."
csjghh1,jimbo831,"Actually, no, none of the dissents said that."
csjgpdj,hawkian,"I must say that Roberts' dissent at least did not take that approach. He is clear that he finds a State's decision ""to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history"" to be constitutional, and that does constitute the government having a say in what marriage is."
csk67z8,Frothyleet,That was the position of none of the dissenting justices.
csjf624,mattsoave,I believe they weren't interpreting a definition of marriage at all. They were interpreting that states' ability to ban marriage for certain people.
csjf5k4,SaladAndEggs,"I don't really have time to wade through all the dissents right now, but CJ Roberts stated in his dissent:>""Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether in my judgement, the institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. It is instead about whether, in our democratic republic, that decision should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to the law. The Constitution leaves no doubt about the answer."""
csjf9kj,spockatron,"it's not, ""i believe the constitution stipulates only a man and a woman can marry""it's, ""i don't think a law stipulating only a man and a woman can marry is strictly unconstitutional"", since if it's allowed by the constitution (however shitty), they're supposed to give it a thumbs up."
csjf6wv,paradiselost79,They believe that state rights override it. Same thing that takes place with all civil rights cases.
csjf6ss,TheAquaman,"> There definitely has to be some beliefs influencing them.Scalia, definitely."
csjfaso,russbii,"I think the actual argument was whether or not it was up the States or the Federal Govt,"
csjfloj,,Read their dissents.
csjfnh9,Aurabek,"Reading the dissents, their argument is more that the constitution does not define marriage at all, and such a definition should be left to the people and their legislators rather than decreeing that it is protected by the fourteenth amendment. I don't think it is fair to say that that position is untenable without bias or an ulterior motive."
csjfrn8,WolverineKing,"According to Roberts' dissent, he says hat the federal government cannot tell the states what marriage is, only ensure that everyone has a right to it. Basically as long as there is an option for someone to get married to someone, the state can set it up however they want.This is pretty stupid and can absolutely have holes poked in it, but it is not nearly as bad as Scalia."
csjftky,redworm,"That's not how they interpret the constitution. To Roberts, at least, it's about allowing states to define what marriage is, that the federal government has no place in doing so."
csjfx0d,Hroslansky,"From what I understood from the dissenting opinion, the question isn't whether or not the constitution covers the right to get married, but whether or not the constitution allows the Supreme Court to make every state legalize gay marriage. I could be wrong, but that's how I interpreted it."
csjfz3k,Matrillik,You're probably at least a little correct. It's a shame that there's really no way to tell what is influencing their decisions.
csjg09a,Sevsquad,That wasn't what the ruling was about. It was about whether gay marriage Bans were constitutional. A subtle but important distinction
csjg5ob,nom_de_chomsky,"They claim to interpret the Constitution as having no say in the question of what a state decides its laws about marriage should be. They say that the majority's decision is the one based on personal beliefs and not legal principle. I wholeheartedly support marriage equality, and I'm thrilled with the effect of this decision. But to be honest, the path by which we get there matters, too, and the minority's position is not without merit."
csjg6sa,Helmet_Icicle,"The contention seems to exist in the fact that a national issue was manifested by such a small group of people, and not that they think gay marriage is in any way immoral or unlawful."
csjg6t9,RsonW,"The common thread in the dissents is that the Federal government (ie, SCOTUS) doesn't have the authority to issue a ruling as marriage is a contract drawn by the individual States. Whether or not you or I personally agree with that viewpoint, it is a valid way to interpret the Constitution."
csjg875,Magoo2,"I don't think its a question of interpretation, but instead that some (if not all) 4 dissenters do not believe it is their responsibility to rule on such matters as marriage. They believe that the Supreme Court is overstepping its bounds by requiring states to recognize same sex marriage.Edit: This can be seen very clearly in Scalia's dissent:>Today's decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court. Until the courts put a stop to it, public debate over same-sex marriage displayed American democracy at its best."
csjgb9t,Quexana,"That's not what they're saying at all.What the dissenters are saying is that the powers given to the Federal Government by the Constitution don't allow the Federal Government to define what is a legal marriage to the states. And on that argument, they do have a point.I'm not saying I agree with them, but I do see their point."
csjgenk,tf2hipster,"Of course they have their beliefs influencing them. That's why there are nine of them, to offset each other.The thing to remember in all the Scalia-bashing is that these are really _really_ **really** smart people. They know they are influenced by their own beliefs, and that's actually part of the job. And as much as I support gay marriage, the dissenters (especially John Roberts' reasoned response) make some really good points... in particular, SCOTUS seems to have taken it upon itself in recent rulings to end the democratic process.Pretty much everyone on reddit (and Facebook, according to my wife) are cheering right now. But imagine if SCOTUS leaned a little more right, and the 5-4 vote went the other way. How would the internet be reacting then when SCOTUS inserts itself into the democratic process?"
csjgii6,Dob-is-Hella-Rad,"That's not how they have to interpret it. In fact, the fact that same-sex marriage was already a thing in several states shows that they never believed that. The five judges had to find something in the constitution that says you can't ban gay marriage. If it says nothing about it either way then states could ban or allow gay marriage as they chose. I support gay marriage but I don't really think the equal protections clause really says a state can't ban it."
csjgx19,supergeek133,"The dissent was more around the fact that:1) There is/was no constitutional definition of marriage, so equal protection doesn't apply.2) The states were defining it on their own, and we should have just let that continue.3) Should the government even be involved in marriage?"
csjh2xc,overzealous_dentist,Marriage isn't even mentioned in the Constitution. I don't why more people don't realize this.
csjh8hw,,You're correct. What the 14th amendment is about is equal protection in terms of the law. This will allow gay couples that equality.
csjhbwr,overzealous_dentist,"I've always found applying the 14th amendment to marriage as a pretty big stretch, personally. ""Life, liberty or property"" would not include marriage, to my eye. I think today's decision was morally right, but I don't think it's founded in law."
csjhdna,lostintransactions,"I find it harder to believe a lot of people do not know what the job of SCOTUS is and what they actually do.They do not sit in a room and say ""gee, is this the right thing to do?"""
csjhdsy,goonersaurus_rex,read Roberts' dissent. It is amazingly respectful and interesting - one of my favorite dissents (even though I am against the vote he cast)Trying to preserve the democratic process for major issues is not the worst hill to die on (especially if you know that your vote wouldn't make a difference)
csjhq42,1-2BuckleMyShoe,"The issue typically manifests itself in the 14th Amendment's declaration that there can be no prevention of life, liberty, property, or due process on the basis of age, sex, or race. When it was drafted, sexual orientation wasn't considered a protected class of people. That changed, but the letter of the law didn't, until this decision. In fact, politics likely played more of a role for justices who voted in favor of gay marriage."
csji26s,InfamousPanda,"Once again, couldn't be more for this ruling, but the idea is that since there is no constitutional ruling on marriage there is no grounds to rule restricting marriage unconstitutional. For purpose of perfect implementation American law, these should be decisions made by the state legislatures or even federal."
csjkgy5,gburgwardt,They believe the constitution grants most rights not explicitly granted to the fed gov't to the states.
csjf2ut,Someone_Care,"I think that you are absolutely right, but even if that's how some members of SCOTUS are thinking its helpful to remind ourselves that they should not be thinking that way. (IMO)"
csjf444,Notcow,"I haven't read them, but the dissenting arguments were probably along the lines of ""marriage is a term of religious origin, and we cannot define it. We should instead reform laws so that marriage in itself has fundamentally less effect on individual rights and regulations.""... Or something along those lines."
csjgtop,Lodur,"Roberts dissenting opinion was actually pretty reasonable, although I disagree with it. Essentially he's disagreeing because he feels that it's not for SCOTUS to determine what is legal or illegal to restrict for marriage but for individual states to determine for themselves. I agree with the decision by SCOTUS but I am not a lawyer or a philosopher (or even take a hobby-level interest in those subjects) so I can't really speak to the strength or validity of either argument."
csjgvll,whatshouldwecallme,"It was more ""Marriage between two people of the same sex isn't a fundamental right that the Constitution protects, so each State can democratically decide whether it applies to them or not""."
csjiesd,scoobyduped,Except for Scalia. His job is just to be a dickhead.
csjj5su,butyourenice,"Yeah, but if you read the text of the dissents, their personal opinions about gay marriage are revealed and it undermines this argument that it's *just* about the Constitution. Alito talks about the oppression of ""traditional"" people. Roberts - whom everybody is giving credit for being so ""rational"" - talks about how marriage is about conceiving children. Scalia just plain shit the bed."
csjkhwp,,"I'll never understand youp people. If the constitution is heavily outdated, why don't you just update it?"
csjr3v9,KittenSwagger,"Exactly. People tend to forget this and think these officials just have it 100% easy and should be a no-brainier. I for one, think everyone should be able to get married, however...when people are elected, they are there to represent the majority. There was a vote that came up here in North Dakota regarding same-sex-marriage and it failed. Does that suck? Yes. However, its the majority."
csjf2gc,idiotsonfire,"Not trying to start anything, but from reading Scalia's statements, it seems like he only votes with his feelings."
csjf73l,Someone_Care,"With the limited information I have I can't help but agree. But at the very least its worth noting that It shouldn't be based on an individual's moral precepts but on one's legal interpretation.Obviously that is not always the case, and probably isn't here."
csjerr5,,And what they believe to be constitutional changes like sand in a windstorm.
csjez05,ASK-IF-I-AM-PAULRUDD,"Conservative judges(and some liberal) tend to follow that, but it's not an absolute rule of the Supreme Court to base off of the constitution exactly."
csjeypd,ThatIsWhatIThought,"True, very true. Reading Scalia's opinion briefly, while his beliefs may subliminally driving his decision, he focused more on taking the fundamental right of a people to govern themselves away (vote for what they want) and giving it to the power of the SCOTUS."
csjf7pj,Rileymadeanaccount,"Except its their shitty personal views that make form their opinion on that laws. They don't have to interperate it any way, they choose to."
csjfatz,MauledByPorcupines,In theory.
csjfgqs,B4SSF4C3,"Considering who voted for or against this, and other hot-button partisan issues, I'd say that it rarely happens."
csjg0yu,flossdaily,"If that were true, the court would always be split based on differences of the philosophy of constitutional and legislative interpretation. But that isn't the case. Instead the court is split on lines of conservative beliefs and liberal beliefs.The cold hard fact is that the court is made up of people who are masters of interpreting the law in whatever way suits their ideology.This is how we get courts that institutionalize segregation with legal reasoning, and desegregate it with different legal reasoning."
csjf4v5,ergister,But what was even remotely constitutional about withholding peoples civil rights?
csjf9v8,Someone_Care,"Well you have to define what constitutes a civil right, and they you have to show where the text of the constitution specifically prohibits taking it away, as they is no blanket clause (IMO). In this case I believe that majority opinion was looking to the 14th amendment."

csjfkvk,scottevil110,"I want to agree and play Devil's Advocate, but I refuse to believe that the 4 most Republican justices just happen to believe that this isn't a case for the Supreme Court."
csjfwwc,Someone_Care,"Well, traditionally Republicans were just as much pro-states rights as they were pro-traditional marriage so I don't think its that far-fetched although I see what you are saying. And I also think its telling that there were 4 different minority opinions and they didn't all use the same reasoning."
csjg0wo,scottevil110,"I agree. If I were just looking at this as an isolated case, I'd be more accepting of the states' rights argument. But this isn't the first case I've paid attention to. I'm not saying that the more liberal justices are any better about it. All nine justices have an overwhelming tendency to find jurisdiction when it's something they personally want changed, and not find it when they'd rather it not be changed."
csjgmg9,Someone_Care,"Very well said, I completely agree."
csjfz0q,CANOODLING_SOCIOPATH,"Obviously these people are voting on party lines. The traditionally conservative judges voting with the conservative ideal and the liberal/going with the law, judges went with the liberal position."
csjfmg0,BorgDrone,"So basically the constitution was badly written, if 9 judges can't even agree on it's interpretation. The language should have been such that you shouldn't need a lawyer to interpret it but a mathematician specialised in formal logic."
csjenf3,ShiftLeader,"From what I'm hearing, they voted that way because they felt it should be left up to us, the people, to vote on it, not a sweeping Constitutional pass.Edit: Don't agree or disagree with that position, just an interesting tidbit I thought I'd point out."
csjf2tg,SCM1992,"The scotus is supposed to vote on what they believe is constitutional, not what is right. Apparently that is the major point for all four dissenting opinions."
csjf88g,reesoc,"This seems to be correct. This is from the beginning of Robert's dissent:>Petitioners make strong arguments rooted in socialpolicy and considerations of fairness. They contend thatsame-sex couples should be allowed to affirm their loveand commitment through marriage, just like opposite-sexcouples. That position has undeniable appeal; over the past six years, voters and legislators in eleven States andthe District of Columbia have revised their laws to allowmarriage between two people of the same sex.>>But this Court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us. Under the Constitution, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be. The people who ratified the Constitution authorized courts to exercise “neither force nor will but merely judgment.” The Federalist No. 78, p. 465 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (capitalization altered).>>Although the policy arguments for extending marriage to same-sex couples may be compelling, the legal arguments for requiring such an extension are not. The fundamental right to marry does not include a right to make a State change its definition of marriage. And a State's decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational. In short, our Constitution does not enact any one theory of marriage. The people of a State are free to expand marriage to include same-sex couples, or to retain the historic definition."
csjhgey,pab_guy,"> a State's decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human historyThis is obviously not true though. The definition has shifted many times, and is not consistent across ""every culture"". Starkly so when we look at plural marriage (africa and middle east, parts of Utah), interracial marriage, marriage that wasn't predicated on a dowry, and on and on.Weird to see Roberts blinded to what should be obvious and well known historical and cultural context. I expect this gibberish from Scalia et al..."
csjfhs9,Gimli_the_White,Because allowing the majority to vote on the rights of the minority has always worked out so well.I'm pretty startled that any of the Justices would consider marriage a privilege to be granted via legislation.
csjfabj,satosaison,"Yeah, we don't vote on fundamental rights in America."
csjk6at,reflector8,"yes, but we certainly do debate what exactly is a fundamental right."
csjfjeu,B4SSF4C3,"Yep, the old states rights argument. There's a point in time that some of the lagging states need to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into modern times. This was one of those times."
csjfxy1,DonCarloGesualdo,"In American political discourse, that is reliably code for 'fuck civil rights.'"
csjf6ji,Brookstone317,"I don't understand that. How can rights be a voting issue though? Either you have a right or not, the Constitution is meant to protect that right.If rights should be voted on who gets them, we would still have Jim Crow laws. /baffledBy trying to pass it off as a state issue, they would be shirking their duty."
csjfcec,yellow900,I agree entirely. It's dangerous to decide minority rights by majority vote.
csjo935,Roymachine,"Yet, this is exactly what happened today."
csk0we2,yellow900,"Yes but there is a difference between a majority vote of supreme court justices and the majority vote of the public. The former is tasked with clarifying and defining federal, constitutionally-protected rights that are immune to alteration by the mass opinion of the latter. I interpret this task as largely protective of minorities whose rights might otherwise be infringed upon by the masses. The supreme court is certainly subject to politicization but it's far better positioned to perform this protective task than public voting, all things equal."
csjg81x,Lord_Varys,"Because marriage is not a right. It's a special legal status created by the States, and so the states should be free to decide who can enter into that status. They could abolish heterosexual marriage if they wanted to, because it's not a right."
csjftr9,WolverineKing,"People have a right to marry. As long as a law does not infringe on that right, the SC cannot overturn it. Where the debate comes from is can a federal court tell a state government what the definition of marriage is?"
csjk54l,reflector8,> People have a right to marry~~Marriage is not a right and people thinking this confuses the issue.~~I fully support marriage by any two consenting adults and am happy for the ruling. But I'd be just as happy with the government getting out of the marriage business altogether. ~~Marriage itself is not a right.~~ Equality is.edit: thanks to /u/wolverineking I will be better informed when I go to sleep tonight than when I woke up this AM.
csjkb4q,WolverineKing,"Universal Declaration of Human RightsArticle 161. Men and women of full age, without any limitation due to race, nationality or religion, have the right to marry and to found a family. They are entitled to equal rights as to marriage, during marriage and at its dissolution.2. Marriage shall be entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses.3. The family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State"
csjhha1,Ready_All_Type,"It would be voted on because someone has to define the extent of a right and whether it's a right at all. It's not a right just because some people think it should be, it's a right because the government recognizes it as one and treats it as one. I'm really glad to see the court decide that this is a right, but Congress is just as capable of deciding it."
csjfbmq,xHeero,They say that because they literally cannot make any other reasonable argument.If they were on the other side of this they would be using their power of the court to do the same thing. It's like Romney arguing against Obamacare saying it should be a state's decision. He literally couldn't argue anything else because Obamacare was essentially a copy of Romneycare.
csjf4bq,Kishara,I think the negative argument was that this should be up to the states as marriage belongs to the states purview. But imo the Supremes did the right thing as the US constitution should override the states every time if they are in conflict.
csjfaad,chop1125,"I am always concerned when I see Supreme Court Justices say an issue of equal rights should be left to the people to vote for. I hate to say I am quoting Ayn Rand, but ""Individual rights are not subject to a public vote: a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority."""
csjfly9,ertebolle,"Which sounds reasonable to a point, but then you have to consider the looming situation of 30 or 40 states legalizing gay marriage and the few holdouts randomly treating gay couples differently, which is most definitely something the Constitution frowns upon."
csjh3gm,NoOneWorthNoticing,"I concur, they think of it as a tenth amendment issue, not 14th. Now, to get my downvotes, all 9 justices stated that religious freedom is just as important a right. America, can we PLEASE be civil and loving about this going forth?"
csjhx9y,Narconomenon,"Yeah, these people aren't getting it. By ""unconstitutional"", we're talking about the fact that the federal government just overstepped their bounds and bypassed state law. Which is super uncool. I get that we're all happy about what it is that they did, but the way that they did it does go against the Constitution, which is all for states' rights."
csjiuk6,tatertatertatertot,"That's true. But it's also true that the decision wasn't creating a right to same-sex marriage. It was recognizing the currently-held legal right to marriage generally (along with the background of marriage as a legal and cultural institution), and then determining that the Constitution did not permit denial of that legal right to a particular subgroup. So, no new rights or laws were invented, the 14th amendment was invoked to allow current rights and laws to be equally applied.So, I think the dissents were a little off-base, and certainly the public reaction against the decision appears to have no conception of what the decision actually was (they seem to think that the SCOTUS invented a new right, but that is not what happened at all)."
csjqfce,President_Cow,Minority rights should not be decided by popular vote
csjf19f,Bgndrsn,"TBH this is a big step forward but idk how needed it was. States have been approving gay marriage all over the place, same with relaxing marijuana regulations.

csk33wd,Galt42,And that is what I think marriage should be. Governments only place is changing your last name should you so choose.
csk3nvy,Rephaite,"So, government shouldn't enforce your right to jointly adopt kids, or to make medical decisions for your temporarily incapacitated spouse, or to own property jointly, or to visit your spouse in jails or hospitals?

You shouldn't be allowed to sue (for wrongful death) someone who negligently kills your spouse?No offense, but your idea of marriage sucks balls.If you want a friendship completely unprotected by the government, that already exists.

It would incentivize monogamous relationships, which would hopefully result in children being born, thus continuing their society. Interracial couples can (generally) have kids. Homosexual couples can not (well, at least not naturally). Of course this ignores that some heterosexual couples can't have kids, or choose not to, but I think as a general principle it makes sense.I'm for homosexuals getting married. I just don't think it is a direct parallel to interracial marriage."

csjf4d0,conningcris,"There is a fairly strong legal argument that it does not have to be ruled unconstitutional. If nothing else Roberts would have sided with the majority if he felt that he could justify the legal argument. Also, if you read the dissents (I have just skimmed them) they pretty clearly say outright that they do not care or support gay marriage, just do not feel that they are the body to do it. As usual read Scalia for a very clear and interesting description of why he does not feel that way.edit: Here is an interesting excerpt from Roberts showing this:""If you are among the many Americans--of whatever sexual orientation--who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today's decision. Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not Celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it."""

Being backwards is a protected thing in this country.That said, we do have federal laws written expressly to prevent things from being too backwards such as anti-discrimination laws. Yes, it should have been a 9-0 decision but it's not unreasonable to assume that states should have the decision unless there's a federal law or compelling Constitutional protection. In this case it's obvious to anyone with a neuron that the 14th amendment applies. Still, deferring to the state is reasonable otherwise."

csjjn31,,"Its not about personal feelings. Its about upholding the fucking constitution. SCOTUS is suppose to function as a check and balance, not a legislative branch. Marriage is a states right issue. Its no where in the constitution therefore its not a federal issue."
csjjrm6,Stardustchaser,"As I stated in another comment, this really is an historical precedent.Many people invoke the *Loving v. Virginia* case as precedent for this, when it's comparing apples and oranges. Both fruit, yes, but different in important ways.First- SCOTUS looks not only at American legal tradition and precedent, but when they extend back in history they look mostly to English and Roman legal tradition. It is there that you can see legal precedents supporting slavery (to touch briefly in what you mentioned) but to get back to marriage, there has been millennia of legal precedent supporting interracial marriage. Hence it was no shocker IMHO that the Warren court ruled unanimously in favor of *Loving*.This case *is* new. There's not much historical or legal precedent. While some folks may point out that there were gay couples and even combat units in Greek and Roman times, that is a far cry from *marriage*. The institution of marriage was the legal standard, was highly promoted in Roman society, and was heterosexual. Period.Perhaps that is in part what Scalia was trying to say- that five justices not only overruled bans in the remaining states, but these five redefined something that has lacked any legal or historical precedent for millennia. Kind of a big deal looking through that lens.Edit: spelling"

csjmj7g,smoothtrip,"I really thought Roberts would flip, so he could look like a pioneer for the court."
csjmqzl,DrFlutterChii,"Edit: Mmm, I think I've changed my mind.The dissent is not about states rights, its about judicial power.""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.""This is the text that was used to declare marriage a fundamental right of all citizens.Specifically,>No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States;Privileges in this case have been understood to mean the following>The Court recognized few such rights, including access to seaports and navigable waterways, the right to run for federal office, the protection of the federal government while on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country, the right to travel to the seat of government, the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the right to participate in the government's administrationYou can see this is a fairly compact and specialized list and is derived from the constitution. It doesn't include healthcare, nor gun ownership, nor education, and no religion or marriage either.If Congress wanted to make all states perform and recognize same sex marriage, they could do so. This would be 'the democratic process' we're so fond of. Instead 5 judges did it. And here's the problem with that. Supreme Court precedent binds every court in the land (except some horizontal courts that do random federal government stuff). Forever. This was not a narrow ruling, either. This means lower level courts are free to shut down any issue THEY dislike (keeping in mind that many of them did happily uphold same-sex marriage bans) and claim that the other person is entitled to 'equal dignity' whatever that means. And your only recourse is to hope the Supreme Court hears the case, and then hope the Supreme Court disagrees. If the Republicans win the next presidential election and don't get decimated in Congress after that, the court is going to be stacked with conservative judges for a very long time, and those judges are now empowered to say ""It doesn't matter what the elected officials say, we're the boss here, you do as we say""Well, I'm sorry, but I believe it harms the dignity of $RichyMcRicherson to not be able to buy politicians and regulators. Oh, dumping big vats of toxic carcinogens? No, I'm sorry, but expensive disposal policies would require they forgo expensive spa treatments and that is VERY undignified. Forever. Because a few old conservatives said so.Yeah, thats just greeeeat. This is the point where everyone will go ""You fuckin nutter, thats absurd.""For your consideration, I present Citizens United. The dissent then used *the exact same* justification as the conservatives are using here. 'Interpreting' a single sentence that in no way relates to marriage, or political finance, in whatever way you please is legislating and courts are not supposed to do that. Shit cuts both ways guys, maybe its just best if we put the damn sword away."

csjf11y,,they still have the right to refuse. freedom of association is paramount for institutions like that and we shouldn't go after them trying to change them. the civil courts form the essential function that churches do for hetero couples so there's no barrier to a homosexual couple to get married.

I want to be wed by someone who can truly give us his/her blessing."
csjjmn4,Randy__Bobandy,"My concern was that there would be another situation similar to the NY bakery that refused to bake a cake for a gay couple on religious grounds. Obviously I believe that everyone has the right to exercise their religious beliefs. But then the bakery was fined $135k for emotional suffering, which is basically tantamount to saying ""you don't have a right to deny me, because my feelings are more important than your religious beliefs, so fuck you, I'm going to seek damages"""
csjf07z,NapoleonTheCat,The government cannot force religious institutions to perform gay marriages but it can force the states to recognize the marriages (up for debate actually). The best thing a gay couple can do is find a church/ institution that will marry them and not raise a stink about those who refuse to. No need to stir the pot further.

Several of the Probate Judges, including our local one in Madison county shut down their offices completely until the ban was reinstated by the State Chief Justice and his cronies.

csjh59s,bripatrick,"The four ""no""s from the Supreme Court don't make sense to me - basically, they voted against it, according to them, because they felt it should be states or popular vote to decide if people are equal or not. Pretty flimsy excuse if you ask me. Just be honest - say that gay sex creeps you out and you find it gross. That's fine to feel/think, but that shouldn't keep others from being able to live their lives and marry who they love."
csjhocz,,"Ostensibly, I think the arguments is that it's a question to be decided by the states of whether marrying the same gender is actually a fundamental right, as opposed to only being allowed to marry the opposite gender. Still, it's faulty logic, a slippery slope fallacy, that if the Court can just say same sex marriage is fundamental, what's stopping them from saying animal marriage is also a fundamental right? But I suspect the subconscious reason for the votes are what you say, they just think it's gross and don't appreciate how important it is for people to have the right to marry the same gender."

csjo8il,bripatrick,"The Constitution was designed to be amended, as a group of men a couple hundred years ago were smart enough to realize the world would change and our laws and policies needed to change with it.

csjzpjz,jdc0409,"Yep And this Supreme Court completely subverted that process. They have said that a body of nine unelected lawyers get to decide what is and isn't a right. We have a Constitution, checks and balances, and States Rights to prevent that kind of dictatorship. Sure, in this case they did something decent, a good dictator is a fine ruler, but the system was designed to prevent dictatorship. What do you think is going to happen when 5 Conservative, activist judges get on the Court with the precedent that they can do whatever the hell they want?"

I can't see how it affects heterosexual marriage at all. So I think maybe he prefers the no-attachment, no obligation, freewheeling lust-based homosexual flings that existed in these ancient societies: ""Who are we to encourage modern, commited, monogamous love-based homosexual relationships?"""

I haven't been following this as closely as I should, but I am genuinely interested and all of the articles I've read won't just come right out and say what the decisions on the two rulings were.

csjuih9,PreSchoolGGW,Excellent choice of description.
csjtzm5,aresef,"It is legal in all 50 states. No state-level ban that was in place yesterday is valid today. The question of federal recognition was answered (with a yes) in the landmark United States v. Windsor of a couple years ago, which tore down most of DOMA except the flagrantly unconstitutional allowance for states to deny recognition to marriages performed in other states. That fell today as well. The Supreme Court is the last word in the matter unless the Constitution is amended or the Supreme Court finds reason someday to reverse itself. But stare decisis means the Supreme Court going forward will lean toward respecting this precedent."

csjoj5d,izalex,Also a horrible injustice and a stain on this nation. It does not negate the fact that the Confederate flag is a symbol of racism.
csjlidi,graphictruth,"Um... it's kind of all the same thing. Or at least, to my racist father it was. They were killed because they weren't white and they had land that ""real"" people wanted. (It's a really *common* rationalization.) He didn't have a problem with that. Neither did Andrew Jackson. Now, I don't know which side of the civil war he would have come down on - but it wouldn't have been for the benefit of anything other than his personal ideals of white supremacy."

csjloc2,lnava,"Thats why when I see a cross, I just assume it stands for ""time to leave""."
csjm52j,FrozenRivers,Why? Because youve chosen to place your perception over the facts?
csjmgkn,lnava,"because noting is inherently symbolic. I can make up any definition for what a cross means and its completely valid apparently.In fact, these symbols we call letters and words don't have any inherent meaning either. I can let them symbolize anything I want them to, because its all just how I choose to interpret these symbols.I interpret the symbols in your previous post to mean that I am the best and you suck.Yay.

csjo2ky,FrozenRivers,"Should we ban letters because some people might read them incorrectly? Symbols arent inherently meaningful, but they do have the meanings which we agree to give to them. They arent meaningless, but they arent inherently meaningful."
csjofju,lnava,"First, the flag wasn't banned, so stop setting up a false dilemma .> Symbols aren't inherently meaningful, but they do have the meanings which we agree to give to them.Exactly. The stars and bars are generally seen as representing a treasonous state that succeeded in support of slavery.Some people may have their own private interpenetration - but the state shouldn't be flying a flag that many people interpret as treasonous and racist.You can still have the flag if you want it. You can still put it on the hood of your car."
csjon0u,FrozenRivers,"> First, the flag wasn't banned, so stop setting up a false dilemma .True, though if manufacturers decide to stop making them, and stores stop selling them, then there's a de facto ban. You can't stop people from flying the flag, but you can stop them from easily acquiring it. > Some people may have their own private interpenetration - but the state shouldn't be flying a flag that many people interpret as treasonous and racist.I agree. The flag should be removed from state grounds. I have no issue with that. I take issue with the hubbub that's surrounded the removal of the flag, such as stores announcing that they won't sell the flag anymore. It's pure politicking."
csjpijl,lnava,"Would you be less upset if there was a law requiring store to carry the flag? Because that doesn't sound like small government to me.Sure... Its politicking, but that's just business. If it hurts there bottom line, then they will stop - if it improves their sales, then it was the right move (for them)."

csjlm5w,lnava,">bottom half of the income distribution had only 6 percent of the wealth.http://www.ncpa.org/pub/st289?pg=3#sthash.FfJMDAOa.dpufSo, if we had a flat tax rate, the top 50% would stlil be paying 94% of the taxes.This fails to capture the fact that the bottom 50% has much much much less disposable income, so taxes are a larger burden to the bottom 50%.Our ""progressive"" tax system is hardly progressive"
csjie3l,Bogey_Redbud,"Well they could buy into another plan. This moves insurance from being an employer based program to a single payer program. As it should ultimately be. There will always be cons to any system. I guess I rationalize the situation the people you know are in as the fact that now millions of people are covered who otherwise couldn't be covered. Another thing the ACA does is make it illegal for insurance companies to drop someone with pre-existing conditions. Back to the flag thing because I'm trying to understand the otherside. Let's remove the idea of the flag representing slavery because I do understand how for some that's not what it represents to some people (even though it was the flag used by the dixie-crats who had a pro-segregationist and white supremacy platform). Doesn't it seem odd to embrace a symbol that harkens back to a time in which half the country committed a treasonous act and declared war on the union? It's just as if we are supporting another country and proudly waving it's flag. Let's remove the biased argument of ""what the hell does the south have to be proud about? They would crumble if not from support from the rest of the country. And not to mention no other part of this country feels the need to embrace a symbol that shows their pride for the north, Midwest, or the west."" So why is it the south feels the need to wrap their identity up with a symbol that reminisces about a time they almost fractured this country?"
csjnjoq,TexasLandPirate,"on the flag thing:It occurs to me that the the Confederate battle flag could be thought of a lot like the Hawaiian or Texas flags. The Kingdom of Hawaii and The Republic of Texas each had flags that flew as national flags for years. Then they were adopted as State flags.The Hawaiian Kingdom was overthrown by plantation owners. A bankrupt Texas petitioned to join the US to avoid being re-annexed by Mexico.Neither event particularly inspires pride... but the flags do stand for a unique bit of history that continues the flavor the current states.If you could get rid of all the racism attached to the Confederate flag, you'd be left with the history and culture of the Southern US. Someone who loves the South could want to protect a symbol of that....maybe."
csjmsbk,mallio,Your anecdotal stories don't change that fact that millions more people have insurance than before.The confederate flag is a symbol of a bunch of states that seceded in order to keep their slaves. How is it not a symbol of racism and treason?

Shit, in Australia, the right wing party are called the Liberals. In Ireland, the Republicans are the anti-unionist, anti-Westminster group. Republican and Democrat are just names.

Unskilled labor jobs which many people rely on to get through college (I know I did) are cutting people's hours to under 30 to stop them from having to pay benefits such as healthcare, which employees are having to pay for themselves to cover Obamacare on minimum wage. Not to mention that a lot of these places refuse to actually work around school schedules and often represent the only job opportunities available to a large populace. The bottom 40% are $10,000 or more in debt and it's damn near impossible to get out of. I've worked my ass off and I'm nearly 30, I make about $32000 a year as of this year and it's by far the most money I've ever made. Surprise, surprise I was born into poverty. I've lived my whole life in poverty and yet constantly and consistently I get told that it isn't that bad by people who've never experienced it. I've known plenty of people on welfare, none of them were living ""comfortably"". You'll find some who have some nice things here and there but for the most part those are people selling drugs on the side who can't report their income because it would get them put in jail. I hear the same bullshit time and time again:>able bodied citizens no longer need to workWhat about able minded? Not to mention you assume that these people are out of work because they want to be, and not because they simply can't find a job. Not to mention that these minimum wage paying jobs are full of petty people who will fuck you over in a heart beat, cheat you, or let you go when you refuse to work in unsafe environments.

This is not unusual in many places.>There are plenty of jobs to be had albeit shitty ones.

I make 71k after my bonus. My take home is about 1400 a month after just paying the student loan interest. Don't cry to me.Good for you, I'm happy you got out, that doesn't mean that everyone can. For every success story like yours there's a thousand failures. You didn't address a goddamn thing I said, and basically just said ""got mine, fuck everybody else"". Which should be the motto for the Republican party. And just so we're clear I mentioned all those things because shit is getting worse, not better. Go work a minimum wage job 20-30 hours a week and try to pay for healthcare yourself, try to go to school when you're scheduled to work whenever the hell they decide, and please complain and then get fired so that they can hire someone willing to do it. Ever been homeless? I have. I also had to work to stop my mom from losing her house, take my brother in when she got hers and take care of other family members when they had nowhere to go. I managed to get through college to find out that the market is over saturated and companies are caring less about degrees and more about experience.

They are descriptors of social stances which those parties just happen to fit, at the moment. But back then, Democrat was the conservative party.

Fighting not for slavery but for fair treatment and lower taxes on exported goods which the south generated over 2/3 of exports at the time. States were beginning to succeed before the idea of abolishing slavery even started. Forget the history they taught you in grade school and do some research before you take a side.

csjosa0,Adlai-Stevenson,A lot of healthcare goes into rehab programs that people are mandated to go to when they are caught with weed.
csjhxy9,JoeyPantz,"Weed could replace tons of big pharma drugs, who charge people ridiculous rates for pills they don't need. Big pharma takes a hit, health care costs take a hit."

Why would you wanna be doped up on chemically made Vicadin, when you can take an all natural pill that does its job better?"
csjlypn,Wilhelm_Von_Schuffle,"Because Vicodin is a opioid. You won't be getting the same quality of pain relief from weed if you were using an opioid. People abuse the shit out of pain killers but there is a legitimate need for these types of medication and under correct use they can be really effective.Don't link google searches, because the top hit on that link suggested that Weed can replace alcohol as a drug............

csjtxef,Wilhelm_Von_Schuffle,I was just providing constructive criticism. The whole reason you want to use a legitimate source is for you own credibility. But it's okay if you want to be ranting about the benefits of weed without providing conducive studies or facts. Plus weed legalization is a topic that does matter in the United States of America.
csk47f2,GallusLafayetti,"Not sure about ""tons"", but I will chime in here to say that I have seen a few amazing things done with cannabis, specifically the oils, that I know would have been impossible (or very expensive) to achieve with regular pharmaceuticals. The most memorable is probably when I gave THC oil to a rooster of mine a few years back. My flock of chickens carries a disease known as ""Marek's Disease"", which causes, among other things, paralysis and tumors. This particular rooster (who was a bantam, so about the size of a pigeon when full grown) had developed a golf-ball sized tumor on his abdomen, right below the vent (butthole). Well, I took a shot in the dark and started giving him a syringe full of the stuff each day. Keep in mind that I had taken him to the vet when I first noticed it, to be sure it wasn't an abscess, so she saw this and noted the size at the time.After around 2 weeks of THC oil, the tumor had shrunk by about 1/2. We took him to vet around that time, and she confirmed that is was quite a bit smaller. Unfortunately the rooster died of unrelated causes a few days later, so I didn't get to see if the tumor disappeared completely, but the progress after just 2 weeks of medication was amazing."

csjshbi,Rettocs,"I agree with your point that everyone *should* pay for their own. But, in reality, we both know that won't happen. This creates a problem, because people are not able to pay for doctor's bills, so they don't go to the clinic for minor issues. Those issues become major and they go to the ER. They still can't pay, so you know who ends up paying for that ER visit? We the people. So, had we just paid for the clinic visit for the minor issue, we could have saved ourselves money down the road.This is the general gist of the pro-socialized healthcare opinion."
csjs1c1,P_Ferdinand,What about the disabled and those not capable of looking after themselves to the same degree you can?
csjsxay,justlurking420,People that are disabled due to obesity and other factors that are completely under their control should pay for their own health care.

csjjbot,Misogynist-bydefault,"Yes it does. I just said whyBeyond that marriage is a terrible deal for the bread winner but don't worry your marriage should outlast the high divorce rate, right?

csjjvm1,listix,I agree that everyone should have their own opinions but it seems that you arent doing anything to force those opinions on others so that is good. My comment was aimed at all those who are calling the end of times and having a mental breakdown because I find them really funny. But not to everyone else who is chill(whether they disagree with the ruling or not).
csjkl4j,Lefty_Mcgee,"Well, if had a say or vote in the issue, I would've said no. Despite that, now that it has been legalized I'm not really going to fret, as long as churches and pastors aren't forced to perform gay-marriages. Although that won't happen because it's unconstitutional. Also, when I pray before dinner, I don't pray to the Supreme Court, I pray to God. The government is not what I put my hope and faith in, I put it in God."
csjkxdk,listix,I love the ruling but I would raise my voice to the heavens if they forced churches to perform same sex marriages. If they want to perform those is up to them. Separation of church and state and all that.
csjfw1i,brynnflynn,Just go to free republic. When I was a farker that's where we found our amusement.

csji17s,onlysame1,"No, they didn't say it should be illegal. they thought it should be up to the states to decide."
csjl03n,,"Yeah, it's too bad most reditors think states rights increases oppression as opposed to being an important obstacle to federal oppression, which is historucally more dangerous"
csjh8aj,Sand_isOverrated,"They don't necessarily, Justice Roberts even said so when he gave a statement explaining his dissent. I agree with the decision wholeheartedly, and I think it is a wonderful thing. However, the Supreme Court doesn't exist to enact policy, it exists to decide whether existing laws are in accordance with the Constitution. The four Justices who voted in dissent, didn't do so because they believed that gay marriage should be illegal, but rather that the existing laws defining marriage weren't unconstitutional. It's an important distinction. I'm sure it was a very difficult decision for all of the Justices involved."
csjhwwk,MoreDblRainbows,">The four Justices who voted in dissent, didn't do so because they believed that gay marriage should be illegalAt least two (probably 3) definitely did."
csjhlwh,shaaaaaake,Then I guess the Constitution is what's scary. There's no excuse for anything but unanimity on this.
csjhtr2,Sand_isOverrated,"I would say that it is more that the legislature that is scary. The Constitution doesn't define marriage *at all*.Congress passed the The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) on September 21, 1996. This was is a federal law that allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages granted under the laws of other states. In addition, individual state legislatures were the ones that were enacting laws defining marriage as man and woman.Ultimately, it was the Constitution that allowed the ruling today to be possible. Without the Fourteenth Amendment, which says all citizens are allowed equal protection of their life and liberty under the law, the ruling today would not have been possible."

csjfebj,BATMAN__,Now it's time to legalize marijuana
csjfee5,HoopyFreud,"Key notes from the opinion:> Baker v. Nelson must be and now is overruled, and the State laws challenged by Petitioners in these cases are now held invalid to the extent they exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite sex couples.---> religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned... those who believe allowing same sex marriage is proper or indeed essential, whether as a matter of religious conviction or secular belief, may engage those who disagree with their view in an open and searching debate. The Constitution, however, does not permit the State to bar same-sex couples from marriage on the same terms as accorded to couples of the opposite sex.---> The Court, in this decision, holds same-sex couples may exercise the fundamental right to marry in all States. It follows that the Court also must hold—and it now does hold—that there is no lawful basis for a State to refuse to recognize a lawful same-sex marriage performed in another State on the ground of its same-sex character.So states are required to consider marriages between same-sex couples just as they would marriages between opposite-sex couples. Any restrictions on marriage based on relationship, age, or some other factor remain in place, and the court explicitly states that, while moral arguments may be persued, state governments are not to entertain such arguments. There's very little for anyone looking for a problem with this decision to grasp at."
csjff77,StrictScrutiny,"June 26th, 2003, was the day that Lawrence v. Texas was decided, declaring that bans against same-sex sexual activity were unconstitutional.June 26th, 2013 was the day that US v. Windsor was decided, relating to DOMA.Today is June 26th."
csjfg2w,Fitzzz,"So, can someone clarify something for me, please? Does this now mean that EVERY state in the U.S. allows gay marriage?"
csjfjos,RemusShepherd,"Yes. Every state, by law, must issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples.Religious institutions probably (not sure) have the right to refuse to wed people they don't like. But all you really need to be married is the certificate, and SCOTUS said you can't deny that to same-sex couples."
csjfxx9,GarageHouse94,"Yes. Technically, it means their 'ban of gay marriage' is ruled illegal (i.e. not consistent with the constitution). So they can't ban it."
csjfgis,nickwimp,"If gays want to marry, let them! Who and the hell cares this much to try and prevent that. I'm straight, married and many times I wish they made straight marriage illegal for the shit my wife puts me thru! Who cares! Let fucking animals get married. I don't care! the IRS is the real winner here taxing one large ""wallet"" over two ""wallets"". Marriage ruined my tax game."

csjfvim,BellTheMan,"Young, straight male, independent with conservative tendencies here.Do churches have the right to deny to perform the marriages? I assume so. Will there be a big conflict about this later?I vaguely remember a few months ago when there was a big deal about non-religious groups refusing to provide services for gay marriage. The one I remember in particular (from CNN playing in the waiting room of a job I used to have) was a bakery that refused to make a wedding cake for a gay wedding. How do laws work in terms of refusing service? From what I understand it is illegal to deny service based on discriminatory means, but how is that line drawn?For instance, a restaurant or a club can choose to be selective of it's patrons, can a bakery do the same?"
csjfxsy,loki8481,"the courts have pretty consistently upheld the right for religious institutions to refuse service on religious grounds (eg: Rabbis can't be legally required to perform a wedding for a neo-Nazi couple, a Catholic church can refuse to perform weddings for previously divorced couples, etc)I don't see it being any different in this case."

The bakery example, they were asked to make a wedding cake, which the bakery has done for many couples in the past, they refused to make a wedding cake despite that being their advertised service and their reasons were discriminatory.However, they could refuse to make a wedding cake with any gay symbolism on it, that would be a new service that they don't traditionally provide so it would be up to them if they supply it or not.There was a middle-ground to be met; make a generic wedding cake. A cake can't be gay, it's just a wedding cake. The customer's business is their own, the bakery's business is cakes.The Church marriage situation is a difficult one. Marriage is a legal binding, so in a free world everyone should be able to be registered as married, but the Church has it's own beliefs to adhere to.It would be like going to a Mosque and asking for a Christian wedding. A place of religious worship should marry couples on the grounds that the couple adhere to the religion that is practised there."
csjgkxg,BellTheMan,"So with the bakery, why can't the refuse to make a cake? I'm just confused on the rules with retail, again going to the club and bar example, they can have huge lines and refuse people in because there's not enough attractive girls in them. Or when I worked in a small bakery, sometimes we wouldn't take a cake order because we'd rather spend our time working on other orders, or we had other stuff to do.So if a gay couple is getting married, and they go into Generic Bakery and ask for a totally generic tiered cake, is it illegal for that Bakery to refuse?"
csjgy5z,xilefian,"> So if a gay couple is getting married, and they go into Generic Bakery and ask for a totally generic tiered cake, is it illegal for that Bakery to refuse?Yes, because it's a customer going into a generic bakery and asking for a generic tiered cake, a service the generic bakery has been doing for customers the entire time.If the customer requests extra services such a a rainbow flag to be stuck in the top, the bakery can refuse to do that, if the customer shouts at the bakery then they can refuse then.The clubs with huge lines refusing people to enter is usually because there's a person cap for each gender, it's been a thing with clubs for many years, each club will have a male:female ratio that they try to keep. The idea is that too many men create a testosterone filled environment that will become threatening (mosh pits form, fights break out, etc). It's not that there's not enough attractive girls, I think you'll find that it's because there's not enough girls in general (a club being a socially trendy environment, chances are most girls at a club are attractive).That is actually a form of gender discrimination, but it's not discrimination against an individual, it would be like the Church only letting people marry if they follow their religion; you're only allowed in the club if you conform to our rules.The bakery's service is; you're only allowed a cake if it's a cake we traditionally provide. We may not make that cake if there are too many orders, but if we can make the cake we will make the cake. That isn't discrimination against a person, that's just the situation of the bakery."
csmj061,KillYourCar,"A lot of what you are asking involves some fairly specific technical legal detail (which I only have a general sense of as a non-lawyer). There is a notion of most businesses being a place of public accommodation. As such, if you open your doors to the public it is generally unlawful to restrict access to your services based on arbitrary notions of who you are serving (i.e., race, gender, religion, national origin, sexual orientation). The basis for this is, as I understand it, rooted in a lot of precedent established in the civil rights era, and amounts to the notion that the greatest liberty is established for the greatest number by placing restrictions on business owners in this regard. Again, there is a lot of legal details involved, but this is how I understand the basic notion."

csjg4hn,ar423,"while I completely agree with gay marriage, incest marriage, polygamy (basically everybody's right to marry whoever they want provided they are of the age of consent, which I think should be lowered while I'm talking about this), I don't think it's the supreme court's place to rule on this - marriage isn't about rights and preferences on what ought to be marriage, but rather a definition of what marriage is based on objectivity from congress - all they should be able to do is enforce what the legislature has said marriage is. if they have the right to say what marriage is in this sense, do they have the right to rule in favour of incest and polygamous marriage too? even though I agree in principle with those things, I don't think the judiciary should have a legislative capacity like this, because they aren't rolling back unconstitutional legislation, they are simply introducing new legislation. only the federal legislature, if there is to be a federal ruling, should have the power to do this, and better, I think the states should be the ones to make this choice as well as a preference."
csjgj0t,LinoaB,"It could be argued that it's not really about the Supreme Court saying what marriage is or is not. They are saying you can't discriminate, you cannot allow privileges to certain people and not to others. We all have certain inaliable civil rights."
csjgpkq,ar423,"yeah but discrimination is a very complicated thing - sometimes it is not about exclusion but rather setting the channels for certain groups to do what that channel is about - e.g. is it discrimination to not allow men into women's toilets? while I don't agree with the view that marriage should only be between men and women because that is arbitrary today, the definition of marriage *may* actually be something arbitrary in the first place, unless congress willed that it were to make sense - it is perfectly possible that congress is stupid and wants a stupid definition of marriage - the role of the courts isn't to make legislation smart, to rather to simply enact it with neutrality. if there is something unconstitutional about that stupid definition, I haven't noticed it - the congress can be stupid, and it can be immoral, but unconstitutional it cannot - what is unconstitutional about a stupid definition of marriage which isn't inherently discriminatory? I mean, technically, the definition of marriage is *still* discriminatory if it ever was, because incest couples and polygamous couples still can't get married"
csjgoi4,TacticianRobin,"They are rolling back unconstitutional legislation. The bans on gay marriage were legislature, before that there was technically nothing legally stopping same sex marriages. They just overturned those bans. No new legislation introduced."
csjgs2g,ar423,"oh okay, if that was the case (which I didn't know about until now) then that ban *is* exclusionary if they actively barred a certain group of people who had the right of marriage all along...?"
csjh2w2,TacticianRobin,"Correct, most of the bans were enacted around 2004 or so, and all of them had language restricting civil marriages to ""one man and one woman"". The first same sex marriage in this country actually occurred in Colorado way back in 1975."

I just really can't wrap my head around the bottom comments. They just seem like arguments that you would use just to disagree... Like, ""let's think of something to say and just go with it."" In his opinion, Roberts wrote: “Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority's approach is deeply disheartening.”Scalia called the decision a “threat to American democracy,” saying it was “constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine.”"

Hodges is up there perhaps in the top 3 landmark case rulings. Brown v. Board of Education, Roe v. Wade, and Obergefell v. Hodges.

I'm not going to talk down to you for that, because the way you worded this told me that you are trying to protect yourself from criticism that you probably run into a lot.All that being said, I'm still unfortunately unclear on your position. You don't agree with homosexuality for religious reasons, which, to me, is baffling considering you go on to say that a person shouldn't be vilified for loving who they love (to paraphrase, since I'm on mobile). In my opinion, this is one of those issues that you can't straddle the fence on. Either you are okay with people who love each other marrying, or you're not. I'm quite unclear on the reasoning behind Christianity's persecution of homosexuality beyond ""the Bible says so"", which to me is just not a good argument and I will never accept this as a valid reason. Not because I'm not a Christian, and not because I don't respect everyone's right to practice whatever faith they choose, but simply because it is not a logical conclusion to draw that homosexuals are immoral or should be persecuted. I could expand on this, but it would take a lot more time than I care to offer, and I don't want to get into a debate on what makes an action or a lifestyle moral.Maybe I just don't follow what you're trying to explain, and I apologize for that. But either way I'm not inclined to insult you or berate you. I'm just...baffled by your position."

csjipn5,,Probably not. I'm assuming many courts will just stop handing out marriage licenses until the decision is reviewed.
csjjwxr,redditorguy,"Who is gonna review the Supreme Court? You mean like ""read over"" and not appeal right?"
csjko7a,,"I'm not an expert or even well-informed on how these things work, but I'm assuming their will be people who try to appeal the decision. Also I think there might need to be some clarification on what this decision means for state governments. Basically I feel like there are some i's to be dotted and t's to be crossed before everything is said and done."
csjl5rk,redditorguy,They can try. Just like they tried denying black folks their right to vote in the south. There is no more appealing. Theoretically people should be able to marry today. I *bet* in more progressive states they will be meanwhile in more conservative states they will drag it out as long as possible.
csjle52,,I'm assuming some states will stop handing out marriage licenses all together.
csjltmc,redditorguy,And hopefully get in trouble.
csjm6ly,,"I don't know. I mean, it's definitely petty, but if we're going to have a state and federal government system we have to draw the line somewhere. I guess it depends on what you mean by ""get in trouble""."
csjmtl2,redditorguy,"The Supreme Court overrules everyone everywhere in the US. I'm not sure what you're getting at.Furthermore in this care, the court said specifically that States could NOT ban them."
csjjwiy,redditorguy,You probably need a partner first.

csjih5m,asdjk482,"Most interested parties probably knew this was coming ever since the decision on Utah's marriage ban (last year, I think?), but it still surprised me with how simple and clear it ended up being. It's alarming how much this country has turned course against orientation-based discrimination, and I never expected to feel this proud of our government.I kind of think it's going to take me a while to adjust to the idea that I could actually get married now (someday...)"

Meanwhile, we have extremely big issues to tackle like our declining race relations, isil terrorizing the world, immigration issues everywhere including Europe, the growing threat of Russia (again), the attempted dissection of Israel (yes, the ONLY democracy and free state in that area AND supporter of LGBT rights so let's stop this business of hating Israel already please especially on this day!).

csjj27t,tcrazyknuckles,"Serious question: Churches and other places of worship would be able to deny performing homosexual wedding ceremonies, correct? The prevailing thought within Conservative circles seems to be that Churches now hold no authority in the U.S., when (at least according to my knowledge) this ruling only extends to the *legal* interpretation and definition of ""marriage"" (the one recognized by the state that gives you some inherent rights). Just trying to have a powerful rebuttal for the inevitable discussion I'll have with my more Conservative friends."
csjj4oh,Axel927,"Yes. There's nothing from stopping those places of worship from exercising their 1st Amendment rights.This ruling says that states cannot deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples, and must respect marriage licenses issued in other states to same-sex couples."
csjj7z6,,"Nobody is forcing anyone to go against their religious beliefs. No one is forcing *anyone* to do *anything*. All that has happened is the Supreme Court has ruled that gay marriage is *not* unconstitutional. They're free to marry, just like religious leaders are free to think it's wrong."
csjjilj,galacticdude7,"That's correct, churches are under no obligation to perform a gay wedding, and any law that would obligate them to do so would be a massive violation of the freedom of religion layed out in the first amendment.the problem with the conservative view of gay marriage is that they view married in the eyes of God as being the same thing as married in the eyes of the State, which it most certainly is not. Because of this they view the legalization of gay marriage as an attack on their religion."
csjjpns,moe-hong,"Yes, of course. This gives LGBTQ people the RIGHT to marry each other, regardless of gender; it doesn't force anyone to marry anyone else (except for civil authorities whose job it is to issue marriage licenses)."
csjj4f5,BreezyBlink,I guess the couple who said they'd divorce if gay marriage was legalized should start filing.
csjj4gq,KeriEatsSouls,That's wonderful news; it was really stupid to not allow gay marriage in this day and age so I'm glad changes are happening.Now what I really want to know is what ever happened to the guy (or was it more than one person) threatening to light himself like a torch in this instance?

csjjk7t,opticon,">“Just who do we think we are?”Americans, Mr. Roberts. We're Americans. We have the right to determine our own laws and direct our own course of history. We do not base these principals on the precedents set by Kalahari Bushmen or the Aztecs, but instead it flows from a sense of dignity we've acquired from being at or near the forefront of civilization. We're a people whose freedoms are protected by a constitution that was written almost 250 years ago but one which we have found can and must bend to the will of the people. It is, after all, of the people, by the people, and for the people. If not, then it has no value for us.You say for this judgement there is ""no basis in the Constitution or this court's precedent."" In this case, Mr. Roberts, I'm glad for the sake of this country's health and prosperity you are wrong."
csjk0lf,Kododama,"-_- what he meant was an unelected group of people just legislated. This is a terrifying thing, while we're happy with THIS decision what happens next time when we don't agree.YOU are the American, and you should really respect your rights more."
csjkblb,Cybugger,"Except that... is it not written into the constitution that the SCOTUS can remove laws that are deemed anti-constitutional? This one was deemed anti-constitutional, and SCOTUS did it's job.People said the same thing with regards to ending slavery and segregation. You'll get over it..."
csjkxde,Kododama,"Yes they can, but this wasn't about an anti-constitutional law. This was about laws passed in certain states that gave people the right to marry. If they said yes or no to the law this wouldn't be an issue. what is an issue is that they took it upon themselves to say yes the law is constitutional and then enforced it on the states that didn't have the law.To put this in another way this is the same as saying one state has an open carry law. Open carry law is deemed constitutional. Every state is now forced to adopt open carry.It just doesn't work that way."
cskbw25,Cybugger,"But didn't this decision basically say: laws banning gay marriage are anti-constitutional? The SCOTUS just said that having laws that discriminate based on sexual preference are against the constitution; as such, they haven't really passed a law, per say, but just dismantled a law still in vigor in certain states.Your example is that of SCOTUS imposing a law on all states, when the case here is them tearing down laws found in certain states, due to the discrimination. It's not the same thing."
cskqnkd,Kododama,"If all that was said is that you can't make a law that bans gay marriage, then gay marriage still isn't legal because there is no law that says the states HAVE to marry and there isn't one that forces them to recognize the marriages of other states.When you jump the process like this all kinds of problems spring up. You either accept legislation from the bench or you have to sit down and deal with the rats nest that forms from a case that should have never been allowed in the court in the first place. It's great and all that a gay person can get married now, but laws were already swinging towards it and by just forcing it from a court all that's happened is half the country is pissed off and the other half is too busy celebrating to realize that the supreme court LOVES precedent and we just fucked up (It was only 7 years ago Obama declared he was firmly against gay marriage, you really thing opinions can't swing on something that we like now?; Justices don't live forever; What happens next time when the judges don't share out views)"
csks6c2,Cybugger,"No one is forcing anyone to marry anyone; it has just extended it to civil unions. No one is marching into churches, and forcing priests and pastors to marry people. It also protects homosexual couples from being cut out of their partners affairs, in the case of a medical emergency, or a death."
csjkc1l,opticon,"I understood what he meant. I wasn't excluding him or the Court from the sentiment. He asked who we think we are, meaning the Court. I reply that he and the court, and all of us, we're Americans and I disagree that somehow the decision was inappropriate to make. His reasoning is faulty and I don't agree with it.>This is a terrifying thingThey did not legislate.

Me being an ally, it upsets me seeing so much homophobia, but I've seen attitudes flip within people. Oprah, in 1997, had a Little Rock Nine reunion where she brought out some of the protestors (from the images actually). They felt so guilty and were in tears, and were ultimately forgiven by the Nine. Things will change over time.There is still so much work to do in gay right, as well as learning to accept all LGBT. Systemic oppression is still a very real thing; we passed the Civil Rights Act 50 years ago but still see racial bias and tension. Things are going to get better as time goes on, though; evolution and progression always win out. For now? Let's celebrate!"

Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits.

Five Justices on the Supreme Court have imposed on the entire country their personal views on an issue that the Constitution and the Court's previous decisions reserve to the people of the States.Despite the Supreme Court's rulings, Texans' fundamental right to religious liberty remains protected. No Texan is required by the Supreme Court's decision to act contrary to his or her religious beliefs regarding marriage.The Texas Constitution guarantees that ‘[n]o human authority ought, in any case whatsoever, to control or interfere with the rights of conscience in matters of religion.' The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion; and the Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act, combined with the newly enacted Pastor Protection Act, provide robust legal protections to Texans whose faith commands them to adhere to the traditional understanding of marriage.As I have done in the past, I will continue to defend the religious liberties of all Texans—including those whose conscience dictates that marriage is only the union of one man and one woman. Later today, I will be issuing a directive to state agencies instructing them to prioritize the protection of Texans' religious liberties"""

He's claiming that after this decision the legal definition of marriage is in limbo due to the fact that it is no longer between woman and man. He raised the question about how much legal ground has poligamy and incest have gained after such decision. Tl:dr help me shut my cousin up on fb
csjop1m,crusoe,"Polygamy, perhaps. But incest no."

I thought Equal Opportunity Employers were the norm everywhere. You seriously need to stop calling it pride. Call it Gay Rights, but not Gay Pride. It's seriously offensive to those of us who aren't gay. What if I went up to you and said ""Straight Pride!! WOOOO!!"" and waived a flag and had a parade? Would you simply be like ""Oh, he's got straight pride, that's sweet."" or would you be like ""Fuck your pride, you aren't better than me because you're straight!!"" Be honest. You'd be offended, because the very word ""Pride"" denotes a superiority to the other side. Now that we supposedly have equality, what is there to be all proud about? Now, in the areas where you can still apparently be fired, where EEOC doesn't exist (didn't know there were places like this), you should continue having rallies and functions in the name of GAY RIGHTS. In areas where you can't be fired, can you spare us? We don't have ""Straight Pride"" parades...so if you wanna be ""equal"" maybe act normal, like you are...just normal people...right? Not better, prideful or what have you. It's all about being a graceful winner, if you don't want to be hated by the employers you are speaking of.

I'm not american so I'm just wondering.No need to down vote me it was a question. I never said what they did was wrong I just thought the separate states had to make these laws for themselves.
csjj0iy,Langston_huge,"The ruling was based on the 14th amendment. There was no new legislature, just the determination that laws against Same Sex Marriage were unconstitutional."
csjj35c,,The Supreme Court gets to decide on the constitutionality of certain issues. In this case they voted that their is no constitutional basis for denying gay people the ability to marry. That's all.
csjqptk,,"The Supreme Court is not making a law, it's finding existing laws (bans on gay marriage) unconstitutional.The 14th Amendment says that all States have to treat everyone equally under the law, and gay marriage bans are in violation of that.The function of the Supreme Court is to interpret the Constitutionality of laws at the highest level."
csjslng,Thin-White-Duke,They didn't make any laws. They decided the ban was unconstitutional due to the 14th ammendment.
csjmu3s,silentxem,"It's iffy. There's precedent for these sorts of decisions (Brown v. Board of Education, Roe v. Wade), but there is also a lot of argument against a ""progressive"" court (not as in liberal, but as in a court that takes it upon itself to make these decisions). It was *not* the intent of our founders to give this sort of power to the court, but Marbury v. Madison was the landmark case that started that shift.It is what it is, and I am of the opinion that it is typically more beneficial than not.Edit: Man, people are pretty casual with the downvotes in this thread. I fail to see where I offended someone."
csjj2z2,TipToper619,yes ...states should be calling this one.....
csjkusw,potnachos,Would you have said the same about slavery?
csjemq8,Tron_of_J,I wonder if socially conservative people will realize that their lives will not change at all as a result of this. Gay marriage never had an impact on them anyway. So proud all of my gay friends can get married and all the legal protections it offers.
csjuzgc,Z0MGbies,"Yo, America. First of all: Congratulations/About time.I know you guys are a little overly patriotic, especially this time of year -- so I insist I mean no offence to America or anyone at all when I ask this bluntly:What's up with your Justice Scalia?? As a recent law graduate (meaning I've recently spent the last 4 years reading judgments), I'm **absolutely horrified** that someone so utterly incompetent and out of touch is on your Supreme Court bench.I have no biases here. I'm not American, and I'm not gay. But he dissents on the legalisation like a child not getting his own way. On top of this, he (recently?) justified torture by US govt by referencing the success of Jack Bauer on the show '24' (in defiance of the *overwhelming* evidence against its usefulness).What on *earth* is someone that unintelligent and inept doing on the Supreme Court bench (or any bench for that matter)? He is making a mockery of the law, and sapping from the nobility of the profession.Is it an American thing maybe? All of the New Zealand and Australian (and a great many UK) judges I've read are absolutely brilliant, even if I might disagree with them from time to time. In fact the worst thing I've read in terms of ignorance or incompetence was a judge failing to appreciate that Facebook messenger was more than a public diary (she was overturned anyway).If a commonwealth judge started making judgments like Justice Scalia they would be removed overnight.Can a lawyer or someone in the field please explain this nonsense??"
csjvjtc,,[deleted]
csjvp2m,Z0MGbies,"So like... I wasn't particularly wrong with my information?? Are you saying he pretty much *is* fucked up and a legal disaster, but there's nothing that can be done? Or what?Also, this explains the latest season of House of Cards a bit better! hahaThank you for the reply by the way."
csjvo61,absynthe7,"If you're on the Supreme Court, you're there for life, to prevent being removed for political reasons. No President or Congress can say ""lawlz I don't like that you go home now"" when a judge rules on law in a way they do not like.The trade-off is that we end up with guys like Scalia sometimes."
csjvwoi,Z0MGbies,"Wow...That's an appropriate check on power, I like it in theory. Surely there should be some sort of self-governance thing though?? (I say this not knowing if there's one for my country-- but then, our Supreme Court can't override government sooo its not really a relevant comparison).Maybe I'll find a way to use email. *I'm sure a cool guy like that totally knows how to use computers, and has heard of the internet.*"
csjw5dt,absynthe7,"The check on this is *supposed* to be that the President and Congress *both* need to sign off on any new additions to the Court. The problem is that we went a little crazy after 9/11, so... well, let's just say the appointees from that era are pretty easy to notice when you read their opinions."
csmjij5,KillYourCar,"People have mentioned the lifetime appointment, but I would also point out that they are nominated by the President and confirmed by Congress. As I understand it there is no specific qualifications necessary to be nominated (kind of like anyone can be nominated to be the Pope. You don't have to be a Cardinal), so if you have a President with a sympathetic Congress anything can happen. There was a brief attempt at a SCOTUS appointment by George W. Bush of one of his close political confidants that was clearly underqualified for the job. That appointment was withdrawn once the firestorm started, but it was a good demonstration how if you think you can get away with it as POTUS crazy shit appointments can happen."

But...What *is* a concern is how many landmark decisions are being decreed by a small unelected star chamber. When folks agree with a decision, it's all roses and strawberries but engaged citizens should keep in mind that willfully giving away the freedom to decide for ourselves is a double-edged sword that just as often can cut the other way. Yay! for SSM, Boo! for how it came to be law. Downvote the heretic!"
csjuf1x,Rhymeswithfreak,If the house would do its fucking job and make laws the Supreme Court wouldn't have to make some of those decisions.

csk4xji,aweful_aweful,Your post struck me the most and i agree. Remeber the decision to allow a corp to not cover all forms of contraceptives? The libs were up in arms and hated supreme court. The supreme court is the most dangerous part of our government with no true checks and balances. Before you say they can be impeached realize its NEVER happened in history. They have the potential to be the true tyrants. They can take a law and view it how they think it should be rather than how its written.

Eventually, I realized that was both impractical and unfair. A few years ago, I voted for the right for same sex couples to marry in my state.

Marriage should be 1 adult to 1 adult, both consenting.And people will say ""there are laws that prevent that!"" but there were laws against this and interracial marriage too. Laws can be changed."
csjh5jt,eliminate1337,"The legal language is very clear here. Laws say that only a man and a woman can get married. According to the Constitution, men and women are equal in the law. Thus, the laws regarding marriage must apply to both parties regardless of gender. There is no precedent for anything else in your post. There is no law legalizing polygamy and there's no framework to challenge that marriage exists between two people.

csjv628,expornregrets,">The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution's central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.You don't see it now, but you are the bigotry future generations will look back on one day and wonder ""how were we ever so hateful and wrong?"" Just as today we look back on women's suffrage and the civil rights movement, they will look back on gay rights and see the inevitable progress of a civilized and educated society where you only see religious dogma."
csjg5t8,davycoder,"> My only concern is if this goes too far and ministers are forced to perform homosexual ceremonies when it goes against their convictions and beliefs.Yup, and in the 60s and 70s people were concerned that ministers would be forced to marry black people, and black and white people.You know what they were? Bigots.You need to change your outlook. No one gives a fuck what religion you are and it doesn't give you any goddamn right to discriminate."

csjhclt,AnAverageOnion,My bad. I should have probably gone deeper to find the definition. I just am having a hard time understanding why a belief that believes something is wrong (and doesn't try and force it on others) is bigotry.
csjfol3,TheOriginalAbe,"> but that's not because I don't support freedom to be happy. It's because I truly believe, and have experienced that the most fulfilling happiness comes through following Christ.Citation needed."

csjgfmq,AnAverageOnion,">It's because I truly believe, and have experienced that the most fulfilling happiness comes through following Christ. I didn't mean to say it was an irrefutable fact. It's what I believe because it's what I've experienced. I can't cite joy. I wish I could..."
csjhmr6,,"You can brainwash yourself into thinking anything gives you the ""most fulfilling happiness"". Our brains are so easy to influence that I could convince you that a rock will bring you good fortune and there is a chance you wouldn't only believe it, but claim to have experienced good fortune only because I implanted that idea into your head. You can believe w/e you want, but the truth is that the reason you experience joy by following christ is simply because you've convinced yourself that that is the case. I'm not trying to convert you or anything. I'm just trying to get you to realize that your experiences are no different than a muslim's religious experiences, a buddhists or any other religious persons experience with their brand of bullshit. Trying to prove religion with 'and have experienced that the most fulfilling happiness comes through following Christ.' is silly. This anecdotal evidence for why Jesus has to be real and therefore homosexuality is a 'sin' is annoying to say the least."

csjhih9,javakah,"> Is there any reason why Polygamy shouldn't be legal as well? I personally believe consenting adults should be able to enter into any union they all agree to.1. Polygamy almost always comes in the form of one man marrying multiple women, not one woman marrying multiple men. It thus creates an imbalance where there is a lack of potential partners for men, that tends to cause problems (increased violence). The number of gay men and women are roughly equal, so does not create an imbalance. Additionally since these people are gay, they would not have been viable partners for the opposite sex anyway.2. The laws are set up to allow 2 partners. There exists a template already for things such as figuring out the division of assets/custody in a divorce between 2 people. There would be a huge mountain of unresolved issues in handling the marriage between more than 2 people."

csjglia,aawillma,"This makes sense when it comes to state-specific things like regulating local industry, laws and taxes that are dependent on population density, etc. It doesn't make sense when it comes to many social issues. It didn't make sense with slavery, segregation, or the interracial marriage ban, and it didn't make sense for this. Side note/rant: I agree with the ruling and scope of this case, but not all. If you look up the history of the 21 year old drinking age, the feds did some shady hand waving to make all states comply after being bullied into it by lobbying from organizations like MADD.

Don't you think states residents should be allowed to decide what the rules and requirements are to carry a concealed weapon in their own states? If you apply the same reasons to the 2nd Amendment and the full faith and credit of Article IV, toss in the 14th Amendment...should a Arizona CCW permit holder be allowed to CC in say, NYC? Or should the good people of NY decide for themselves who should be allowed who can and cannot? This is the problem with the judiciary in the US, it is becoming more driven by politics than the reading of the Constitution. We all know that there will not be a country wide CCW allowance based on a SCOTUS case. If the case did come to their attention, they would have to twist, turn and otherwise contort their judicial reasoning to avoid finding the same decision. Law is suppose to provide clarity and (some) predictability and consistency of result. We are drifting far afield from that. I personally believe that marriages are civil contracts, and all citizens have the right to enter into a contract with whoever they want, so I support same-sex marriage. I just don't like how we got there."

csjezny,Starbucks_Lovers,"In my hot second of reading Roberts' dissent, it's up to the states to decide how to define marriage."
csjetpk,inksday,Because it is basically giving the Federal government more power over rights the states are supposed to have. The federal government isn't supposed to have control over any rights unless explicitly stated in the constitution. All other rights are to fall to the state to decide.
csjlzts,Tvayumat,"Not human rights, they don't.States don't get to vote slavery back in, or decide they don't want women to vote in their particular state."
csjnvzi,inksday,Marriage isn't a human right. Nobody was stopping gay people from having their own form of religious marriages. The legal definition of marriage was a state right. Which is why each state gives out their own individual marriage licenses. States have control over anything not explicitly in the constitution. What the SCOTUS just did despite being a good thing is technically unconstitutional. While I wouldn't cry or throw a fit to have it reversed you do have to ponder the slippery slope of allowing the SCOTUS to flat out violate the constitution. This is something that should have been fixed via a constitutional amendment.
csjo28v,Tvayumat,"It seems to me that this topic of whether or not marriage is a human right is THE question at the heart of this issue.It also seems to me that there are a great number of people who believe that marriage, being an institution so intimately interwoven in our everyday social interactions as to be inescapable, and the choice of who you marry is in fact a basic human right.Simply saying ""X isn't a human right"" doesn't end the conversation, and this ruling from SCOTUS based on the 14th amendment seems to support that."
csjo8aw,inksday,"I still don't see how the 14th amendment applies. Gays are equally protected from the law. They aren't being arrested for being gay or having their homes searched for being gay. What exactly were they being denied? Civil Unions have been a thing for a very long time, offering pretty much the same benefits as marriage. Is it really a right to be able to call it the same thing just for the sake of doing so?"
csjoiyp,Tvayumat,"They are being deprived of over 1,000 legal and financial benefits that the government institution of marriage grants married couples, not least among which is the right of kinship for medical and legal purposes.You are correct in that Civil Unions and Domestic Partnerships have existed for some time. However, the legal recognition of these statuses can vary WILDLY from zipcode to zipcode, with recognition varying from a selection of legal rights to a simple formal recognition of a relationship with NO attached rights.This is essentially a second class status, and no committed relationship should be classified as lesser than another based on some antiquated code of morality that simply *isn't* venerated by the current, living generation.Your old roads, they are agin', and the times, they are a'changin."
csjovqk,inksday,"I don't care that gays can get married, I care that SCOTUS has potentially decided to ignore state rights and to ignore their actual job to change something that should have been left to an amendment to change."
csjp2hk,Tvayumat,"But the argument is that the wording is *already* in place.Scalia made this argument, that the concept of same sex marriage was not even on the table when the amendment was passed. This is true.It's also true that at that time, people viewed homosexuality as a mental disorder or possibly the result of devil possession.The facts haven't changed, the wording hasn't changed, however our UNDERSTANDING of and access to the facts has changed, and it is absolutely good and proper for the Supreme Court to interpret the amendment in light of our new understanding."
csjvgi8,,Is the supreme court an extension of the federal government? I thought they were separate. (Canadian asking).
csjxdpe,inksday,"Yes, SCOTUS is the head of the judicial branch of the Federal government. It's job is to decide whether rulings from lower courts and legislation from the Legislative branch (congress) are constitutional. The third branch is Executive which is the President."

csjfd2q,mostirrelephant,"It's not about seeing the light. This came down to a disagreement on interpretations of the fourteenth amendment, not a moral debate."
csjfi0v,antiqua_lumina,Yeah and I thought Roberts would side with the more reasonable interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
csjfreg,mostirrelephant,Fair enough.
csjfkzy,,"Eh, Roberts' opinion seemed more about arguing that the right to marry isn't something laid out in the Constitution, but that he sees no problem in letting gays marry. Scalia's opinion is also similar (even if it is a snark-drenched tantrum in legalese about ""abuses of the Supreme Court's powers"")."

csjsrr4,loki8481,no one's saying it's bad (necessarily) but this case has nothing to do with polygamy
csjt3op,Blaztoiz,It's about equal marriage rights. So why not be equal with everyone.
csjt8fl,loki8481,"well sure. and polygamists are more than welcome to mount their own legal defense of polygamy and take it to the supreme court, but this ruling at its core is really only about gender equality.a woman can marry a man, but a man can't marry a man, giving them unequal rights and violating the 14th amendment.polygamy, though I fully support it, has nothing to do with this case."
csjsqs6,rutefoot,Stop trying to turn this isn't a slippery slope argument. It's transparent as shit
csjtbc6,Spokker,"Anti-polygamy mostly stems from the fact that it's typically described as one man marrying many wives. So it's sexist, or abuse toward women, and it usually is.But if they can recast polygamy in a new light I could see it becoming legalized in 10-20 years."

csjekyx,RememberYoureAWomble,"I listened to the oral arguments (available on the supremecourt.gov website - EDIT: link is [here](http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/audio/2014/14-556-q1)) and I have to admit I was a bit surprised at the narrow nature of the contra argument. Essentially it was that the state had a legitimate interest in regulating 'marriage' (i.e. a legal relationship between two persons from which flow the rights and obligations entailed by marriage) because it was good for children. (I have oversimplified.) The arguments made in public, more generally, however, seemed to have been much broader. I may not agree with most or any of them but there were a lot more of them. Can anyone tell me why the issue was argued on such a narrow basis? Was it because, e.g., someone thought the other arguments were not sustainable, or did the Court only give permission on narrow grounds?"
csjfdg0,exec721,Perhaps because it requires religion to justify and that would be in violation of the Establishment Clause? That's my guess anyway.

csjfkpr,HaydenGalloway2,This is a victory for gays but more importantly its a victory for the Republican party electorally. Gay marriage opposition was very damaging to the Republican party. Just as gun control is for Dems. Polling shows there are huge numbers of young people who are economically conservative but were not voting Republican because of the party's gay marriage opposition.This has now been taken away from Democrats as a wedge issue. It will take some time but in the long run Republicans will see huge increases in youth votes.
csjfq0c,,Keep telling yourself that.http://www.pewforum.org/2015/06/08/graphics-slideshow-changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/

csjgwqw,fullsaildan,I don't think it's a win for the republican party at all. Abortion didn't stop becoming an issue for them once the supreme court ruled on that.
csji14c,HaydenGalloway2,But they didnt rule on it. They set an arbitrary time that was bound to change as technology improved. This is a clear ruling that will not change..
csjftpe,RichardMNixon42,"From Thomas's dissent>“The corollary of that principle is that human dignity cannot be taken away by the government,” Thomas wrote in his dissent. “Slaves did not lose their dignity (any more than they lost their humanity) because the government allowed them to be enslaved. Those held in internment camps did not lose their dignity because the government confined them. And those denied governmental benefits certainly do not lose their dignity because the government denies them those benefits. The government cannot bestow dignity, and it cannot take it away.”What in the actual fuck?"
csjfuu0,michellengineer,"I could cry. As an LGBT American in my 20s, it has been incredible watching this all unfold.

csjgihf,vasheenomed,Woo time to join in on one of the biggest reddit threads ever and a huge moment in history
csjgp1w,SHEAHOFOSHO,"The substance of today's decree is not of immense personal importance to me. The law can recognize as marriage whatever sexual attachments and living arrangements it wishes, and can accord them favorable civil consequences, from tax treatment to rights of inheritance. Those civil consequences—and the public approval that conferring the name of marriage evidences—can perhaps have adverse social effects, but no more adverse than the effects of many other controversial laws. So it is not of special importance to me what the law says about marriage. It is of overwhelming importance, however, who it is that rules me. Today's decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court. The opinion in these cases is the furthest extension in fact—and the furthest extension one can even imagine—of the Court's claimed power to create “liberties” that the Constitution and its Amendments neglect to mention. This practice of constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine, always accompanied (as it is today) by extravagant praise of liberty, robs the People of the most important liberty they asserted in the Declaration of Independence and won in the Revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves. -Scalia"
csjgxcr,J_Drama,"Although unpopular, Justice Scalia does make an excellent point (and this viewpoint echoes a similar dissenting opinion he expressed regarding the ACA subsidies).

csjhau0,cartographer721,"All this right wing talk about how the Supreme court ""ignored the votes of the people in their states"" is such crap. The whole argument that it's a ""violation of religious rights"" to prevent religion from imposing their narrow minded beliefs on the rest of us through legislation is laughable. It is never your ""right"" to prevent others from having theirs. When the court rules on the Constitution in favor of right wing ideas, despite the protests of the more liberal masses it's all good.

csjnn2c,m5726,"It doesn't effect our country at all. Constantly forcing one's agenda in everyone else's face which calling anyone who disagrees a bigot, is wrong."
csjnvfz,,"How about the fact republicans didn't want gay people to have the same right to marry as everybody else, along with those government benefits that come with it. I'm sure the whole forcing agenda thing was also said when it came to pushing for women's right to vote."
csjp5zy,,"When someone's agenda is to get the same rights as everyone else and people are against it for no discernible reason that is a working definition of bigotry. You can't just say ""you called me a bigot, that is wrong."" It's honestly a baffling response to someone asking for a reason beyond bigotry."

csjtjac,jeffhext,"Once people put down the glitter, here's Roberts opinion, who everyone was applauding yesterday:... this Court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us. Under the Constitution, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be. The people who ratified the Constitution authorized courts to exercise “neither force nor will but merely judgment.” Although the policy arguments for extending marriage to same-sex couples may be compelling, the legal arguments for requiring such an extension are not. The fundamental right to marry does not include a right to make a State change its definition of marriage. And a State's decision to maintain the meaning of marriage that has persisted in every culture throughout human history can hardly be called irrational. In short, our Constitution does not enact any one theory of marriage. The people of a State are free to expand marriage to include same-sex couples, or to retain the historic definition. Today, however, the Court takes the extraordinary step of ordering every State to license and recognize same-sex marriage. Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority's approach is deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sex marriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens—through the democratic process—to adopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept. The majority's decision is an act of will, not legal judgment. The right it announces has no basis in the Constitution or this Court's precedent. The majority expressly disclaims judicial “caution” and omits even a pretense of humility, openly relying on its desire to remake society according to its own “new insight” into the “nature of injustice.” As a result, the Court invalidates the marriage laws of more than half the States and orders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis of human society for millennia, for the Kalahari Bushmen and the Han Chinese, the Carthaginians and the Aztecs. Just who do we think we are? Understand well what this dissent is about: It is not about whether, in my judgment, the institution of marriage should be changed to include same-sex couples. It is instead about whether, in our democratic republic, that decision should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legaldisputes according to law. The Constitution leaves no doubt about the answer."
csju5bg,aresef,"The right to marry is not enumerated in the Constitution. However, Loving v. Virginia ruled that such a right was fundamental, a finding echoed in Kennedy's opinion. The Fourteenth Amendment stipulates no person may be deprived of liberty without due process of law. If two consenting adults of any gender are being denied the fundamental right to marry, then they are being deprived of liberty without due process of law. Roberts went off the rails in his dissent, but his was the most moderated of the four dissenters. Justice Thomas argued blacks held in slavery were not denied their dignity. Like...holy shit. That's Scalia-esque crazy."
csjty1x,loki8481,I don't see how this is anything more but the Supreme Court throwing out laws that violated the equal rights of both men and women to marry a woman (and vice versa)
csjtuq9,YMDBass,"This will get buried, no doubt about it, I'm so late in commenting on this. I do plead with anyone who reads this, do not treat someone who was opposed to gay marriage like a bigot. I will honestly say, I grew up in a conservative household (have grown libertarian in my lifetime) and at one point I was one of these people, hell my parents were too and they both have also changed their minds in regards to this. The thing is, yes, the retarded pastor who is gonna set himself on fire is one thing and he won't budge on his belief until he dies..literally, but the average joe who believes that marriage is between a man and a woman is likely not. Hell, most Christians when they understand their bible have nothing but love for those in the LGBT community, it's just not their lifestyle. Today has proven that a peaceful, logical, and love positioned approach will win in the long run, so keep it up. I truly believe (hell I know from personal experience) that having people in your life with dramatically different viewpoints can change the way you think about things, so I plead with anyone in the LGBT community (If you're comfortable with it), reach out and be that differing viewpoint for someone who may never have known (or at least, they probably think they've never known...god I was an idiot) a homosexual, and don't worry about changing their mind, just change their heart. Congrats on the ruling, now if you're in a committed relationship, go get married.Edit:Tried to break it up better."
csk2aa1,,"People who oppose gay marriage are bigots. No doubt about that. Religion is a mask/excuse for bigotry, nothing more."
csk3j0s,YMDBass,"Id venture to guess far more of those people are misguided as opposed to truly bigoted. In 1996, only 19 years ago, according to [gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/117328/marriage.aspx) Only 27 percent of Americans supported same sex marriage, currently the number sits at 60%, a 33% increase in 19 years. Those people who changed their minds were not bigots, but misguided and I'd venture to guess that more than half of the remaining 40% are misguided rather than truly bigoted. As for the religious aspect, I won't speak for anything besides what I am (a Christian). The bible does say things contradicting homosexuality, but ultimately, judgement should not be brought on by any person, but by god. The bible does teach that you should love people and people who aren't believers can be more godly than those who go to church every week (see the parable of the good samaritan). Lastly, it does say if you are guilty of one sin, you are guilty of all, so in fact, all of the people who use Christianity to denounce same sex marriage are themselves guilty of ""homosexuality"". Religion is not always the villain some make it out to be, the loudest assholes (wbc, billy graham, the retard who's gonna burn himself alive) do not and should not represent a vast portion of the Christian population, many of which supported what took place today."

I don't understand why the ""let consenting adults love and marry who they want"" rationale extents to LGBT lovers but not to polygamous ones. If it were up to me, this would be the next thing I'd push for if only for logically consistent policy."
csjxzni,TheCrazyTacoMan,"I don't know if it would be the same with the equal protection clause. They aren't being denied marriage just multiple marriages. Honestly, I think the biggest issue is our tax codes and insurance system isn't designed to support that. That and the ""but my religion"" argument."
csjzdrt,bankerman,"""They aren't being denied marriage just multiple marriages"" sounds a lot like ""they aren't being denied marriage just same-sex marriage"". At the end of the day, you're still limiting the definition of marriage to the kind you find acceptable."
csk2q58,TheCrazyTacoMan,"I am saying marriage and its benefits were being denied to an entire LGBT community. So now they share the same rights as the rest of us. In a polygamy situation you have to create new rules regarding taxes, inheritance, social security, etc. Making sure you aren't creating a class that doesn't create new rights that monogous marriages would not have would be difficult.I suppose I should have said logically it would come next as an expansion of marriage but maybe not from the same laws that ruled for it today."

Japan does not recognize marriage except by man and woman--and the argument is that all the family law is so entrenched in this concept that changing it will take forever, patriarchal society and koseki and all that jazz. Anyways...Japan recognizes same sex marriages issued in other countries when dealing with foreigners living here. In other words, if you live here as a resident and get a spouse visa for your spouse, you can get one for a same sex spouse so long as that marriage was legally recognized in your home country. This extends whatever benefits you had as a resident to your spouse. So it's kind of funny that Japanese people don't have the right in Japan, but foreigners do."

I just realized that people might have assumed I was equating straight allies' support with a desire to go down said slippery slope, which was the complete opposite of what I meant, and I need to stop posting comments when I'm half asleep."

csjj88c,brashdecisions,It was a 5-4 decisionShould've been an easy decision. wasn't. was still made though
csjf81q,SaxifrageRussel,"Constitutionally it's more grey than it appears on the surface. It was/is a state by state law, so imposing a top down federal rule is a big step and is definitely government meddling. That being said, it's hard to reconcile banning gay marriage with the Loving decision providing precedent. As far as I can tell, they used the 14th amendment instead of protected classes."
csjmbj5,,"These posts are rife with positive celebration for the Supreme Court's decision, and in part they should be. The legal rights of same sex couples shouldn't be infringed. However those celebrating, and those deploring the dissenting opinions, are misunderstanding the court's responsibility.That is, it is not, nor shouldn't be, the court's impromptus to engage ethical dilemmas, moral reasoning, or philosophical discourse. It is clear from the majority opinion that a moral responsibility was being assumed. Though a moral responsibility SHOULD be assumed, it is by the legislature that these issues should be addressed. This was the dissenting opinion and my opinion. Those who feel their dissention is a result of hate are in error.The equal protection clause, nor anywhere else in the Constitution, includes mention of sexuality as a role in marriage. Thus for something ambiguously written, the court must examine the writer's intention. After all, intention doesn't change, though interpretation does. It is clear that sexuality and marriage was never in question until relatively recently in our nation's laws. Those states that addressed this question and responded were correct to do so. But to interpret the constitution, as it was written, to adapt to a modern opinion is fundamentally wrong. The legislative process exists for this purpose. The majority opinion trespassed their responsibility, and this is the 'threat to democracy' that Justice Scalia is referencing and Justice Roberts all but specifically said."
csjnafu,annoyingstranger,"The equal protection clause guarantees the law will treat you equally regardless of your gender. How would that not inevitably lead to same-sex marriages? I'm not allowed to get this marriage license, but if my partner came back with someone who had different plumbing, they'd be just fine? That's clearly gender discrimination."
csjohqb,,"It has inevitability lead to same sex marriage, as per the court's ruling. The dissenting opinion, and mine, is that matrimonial freedom wasn't a goal. Suppose the 14th amendment was written today. Given that gay marriage is an issue, if the writers intended for equal protection to extend to all, wouldn't they have included it specifically?On the point of it being gender discrimination, I very easily understand how you interpret this issue. My point is that the constitution has guaranteed certain *personal* freedoms. You aren't being discriminated because the other person is a man or a women. You are being discriminated (and I agree that you are) because of a sexuality. It's no more or a choice than your race or with what plumbing you were born. But I do not believe the 14th amendment writers would agree with you or I. This intention is the heart of the issue."
csjoyxx,annoyingstranger,"If their intention were the issue, why'd they bother writing words in the first place? I think you're wrong here.The reason we write laws, and the reason we have courts to interpret them, is because the intent of the lawmakers is a secondary concern. The court's responsibility is to the letter and spirit of the law. The letter of the law is objectively static regardless of the intent of its writers or the people it governs. The spirit of the law reflects both the intent of its writers and the people it governs. The intentions of those who wrote the Fourteenth are no more relevant than the desires of we who are governed by it, and no less relevant, either. More relevant to the court's responsibilities are the words themselves, which conveys the following:> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.Ask yourself, without consideration for who wrote it and how they felt about it, without consideration for anyone living under it today, but only and strictly by reading those words: doesn't this passage clearly oppose special bans related to a person's gender?"
csjtz1j,,"> If their intention were the issue, why'd they bother writing words in the first place?Everything written has meaning. It is our disadvantage that words cannot always express everything that's meant, however. For this reason we have judges and courts who's responsibility is to interpret the *letter* of the law for the *spirit* in which it's written. To interpret something new each time our opinions change is reckless and foolhardy. The legal system exists for for the purpose of adaptation. **That is my point**. Otherwise we are surrendering the democratic process to a very small group of people, in this case five. That is not democracy, that is oligarchy.>> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.> Ask yourself, without consideration for who wrote it and how they felt about it, without consideration for anyone living under it today, but only and strictly by reading those words: doesn't this passage clearly oppose special bans related to a person's gender?Strictly, no. As an aside, it's interesting that an amendment was submitted (and curiously unratified) explicitly protecting rights from gender discrimination [Equal Rights Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment). Perhaps it was the author's intention to be vague, and therefore perhaps universal. But I doubt that.If you haven't read the [majority opinion](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf), it's a good read and an excellent philosophical argument for the legitimacy of gay marriage. Truly it is. But I do not see the *legal* basis to declare the traditional view of marriage unconstitutional. To quote Justice Kennedy:> ""The fundamental liberties protected by this Clause include most of the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights. See Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 147–149 (1968). In addition these liberties extend to certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define personal identity and beliefs.""The extension of our legally protected liberties is an excellent thing. But laws protect our freedom, not idealism."
csju7ab,annoyingstranger,"I don't see how you can read the 14th and not see that depriving a person of certain liberties based on their gender and without due process is forbidden.> For this reason we have judges and courts who's responsibility is to interpret the letter of the law for the spirit in which it's written.From the Court today:> The nature of injustice is that we may not always see itin our own times. The generations that wrote and ratifiedthe Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did notpresume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions,and so they entrusted to future generations a charterprotecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as welearn its meaning. When new insight reveals discordbetween the Constitution's central protections and a receivedlegal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.It's the Court's responsibility to ensure the law is interpreted strictly to what it says, but within that restriction, to how it serves the people it governs. What the author of the ERA was thinking wouldn't seem relevant here, but I'll bet if we dig into it we'll find many arguments against its ratification citing redundancy with the 14th.Millions of Americans today enjoy a freedom they wanted but did not enjoy yesterday."
csjrrje,Crankyshaft,"This belongs in /r/iamverysmart. The Equal Protection Clause does not mention marriage at all. And as for interpreting constitutional provisions to address new problems or situations, the Court has been doing that for 200 years."

csjnvlr,,"Unlikely. Did I not say I support free marriage? (Hint: I did.) It's common to believe that an outcome should only be viewed from the context of the outcome. If Congress passed a law to the same end, I'd be 100% happy. It is their job to represent the people. Not the Supreme Court's."
csjw8yh,Bartelbythescrivener,"The whole notion of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights , was to protect the rights of the citizens. The majority doesn't have the ability to violate the rights of the minority. Think of it like speech, the majority may find speech offensive, but the speech is still protected.Even if the majority voted to take away an individuals right to speak, the supreme court would overturn that law, because it violates the Constitution. So know we understand that no law can be passed that violates the rights of a citizen no matter how democratically that law came into being. So lets look at the next problem, is a right to marriage enumerated in the Constitution, the answer is no, however a lot of the rights that we have are not explicitly expressed in the Constitution. So the question becomes, can we infer from the language of the Constitution that the rights extended under the Constitution would cover this group. Good willed people can argue about it and have differing opinions but whenever the Court rules to extend rights held by some to apply to all, I honestly don't see how it could be wrong. The Court is not infallible , but if you look at they cases where they have failed: Buck v. Bell, Japanese internment, multiracial marriage, separate but equal, those cases where of the nature to deny rights. In fact historically the Court has actually been a force for the status quo or a defender of the power of the government. I would argue they every time they have given rights, those cases have not had to be revisited. When they have curtailed or limited rights is where they are often had to be adjudicated again.As much as I don't like Citizens United, I believe it was the correct constitutional decision. As I believe this decision was also. It would be nice if we could have taken care of this problem through Congress, but we didn't and our fellow citizens were having their rights violated under the force of law. Just like Jim Crow laws were found to be unconstitutional despite the will of the people, these laws were found to be the same. If your curious about this, click on my name and I have another post related to this issue."

I'm super happy for Americans being an LGBT person myself I agree this is great news, but this isn't the most pressing civil rights issue for us. Same-sex marriage is important, but also largely symbolic. Hate crime bills, employment and housing protections, as well as legal avenues to seek help or achieve autonomy and escape persecution are extremely important.

csjf3sc,JR-Dubs,"For those interested, it was Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan. Completely unsurprisingly Roberts, Alito, Scalia and Thomas all filed dissenting opinions.Reading Roberts' dissent, the message from him seems to be ""this is a legislative problem that should be decided by the states, as has already happened in numerous places."" Which is not a bad position, but then the question of whether a state that doesn't legalize gay marriage would recognize a married gay couple whose marriage was had out of state. Which (although I have not studied his dissent fully yet) seems like a legitimate question to be before the SC."
csjf3w2,CountryRoads8,"Great decision. I generally don't think government should have any role in marriage either way, BUT if you're gonna offer tax benefits to straight marriage then you must offer gay marriage and the same benefits, rights and privileges. Being in Texas I'm curious to see how this is received."
csjfof9,fungoid_sorceror,> I generally don't think government should have any role in marriage This is a preposterous attitude to have. Marriage is at its heart a legal contract that confers a defined set of benefits upon the parties to that contract. All of this romantic bullshit is a very recent development. Historically most marriages were transactions conducted by the parents of the bride and groom.

csjf6vy,W_T_Jones,Can someone explain to me - I'm not from the USA - what this really means? Does that mean that homosexuals can now marry in every state they want?
csjfdgw,tritter211,Yep. It used to be that each individual states decided the legality of Gay marriage by itself. Supreme court upheld the constitution right for marriage by telling that homosexual couples are also allowed to marry just like heterosexual couples anywhere in USA.

csjfbjb,,Took them long enough. Better late than never I guess. Marriage is purely a political concept and the courts made it that way when they mandated marriage licenses. It has no meaning aside from that except what the people who enter into that legal agreement put into it. So the most popular arguments against it are kinda absurd.

csjfpfl,ssmarcos3,Wow didn't even know this was going to happen.
csjfpjk,iph_tx,Now here is what I don't get... people have the right to refuse service to anyone. If you go to a shop and say you want a cake for your gay wedding and they don't want to make it for your wedding... is that shop owner going to get sued because they didn't want to Violate their beliefs and right to turn down any customer? I am all for marrying who ever you want to marry... but don't force your ideals on someone who doesn't share the same beliefs as you
csjfume,xilefian,"The right to refuse services still stands, but I don't think you're allowed to refuse service on the grounds of discrimination.There is always a middle-ground; as an example the cake shop could just make a generic cake with no writing and instruct the customers how to apply their writing. You can't make a cake for a ""gay wedding"", it's just a cake for a regular wedding (AKA, a wedding cake) unless you explicitly decorate it to be gay."
csjfusx,jas75249,They can't make a private business owner do anything.
csjfwtc,iph_tx,There was a couple in Colorado who were forced to close their business because a gay couple sued them for descrimination for not making them a wedding cake. Edit: autocorrected
csjihry,jas75249,"Oh, they were sued for discrimination, so we should allow discrimination?"
csjli3u,iph_tx,"So now we ruin businesses and people's lives all over petty things like a cake? It isn't right, but instead of going to someone else they decided to sue and then ruin a family's life. One wrong doesn't permit you to do another. They had to close business due to the mountain of costs because they we being sued."
csjmwvf,jas75249,Discrimination is discrimination no matter how petty it is and should be permitted.
csjobbx,iph_tx,So forcing business owners to do shit thay violates their beliefs is now permitted?
csjfws5,vallexum,"They're refusing a service they do, so yes. Their chosen beliefs are conflicting with the sole service, providing and decorating cakes. Their conflict with not doing it is a point of view, it's not not a part of their service. They have to do it if they're offering it to other people. If they don't want to then they can't offer that service any longer. There is no yes for you no for you way around it."
csjg3d6,iph_tx,"So forcing someone to Violate their beliefs is now norm in the country? I mean, the country was founded on the belief that anyone could believe whatever they wanted, be whatever they wanted and practice whatever they wanted... so if they don't want to make a cake for a gay couple they are still forced to do so because it is desctimination on their beliefs, yet they are being forced to do something against their own practices. I mean, that's a little odd to me... I don't give a damn who you are, money is money if you are going to give it to me for a service, but if they don't want to do it for you... they shouldn't be forced to do so just because your beliefs and life style differ from their own."
csjglx7,vallexum,"Their beliefs are not the service they're offering. If they were offering a service of Christian prayers, and a non-Christian person asked for non-Christian prayers, the person offering the service can refuse because that isn't what they're offering.Someone offering a service of making and decorating cakes can't refuse to make and decorate a cake to someone because of their chosen beliefs. Those chosen beliefs aren't part of the service, only the cakes are.If they were openly exclusive of who and who they sell to, then it would be a different case. If they want to be open and say ""we only make cake for weddings between one man and one woman"" then they would *only* be able to sell wedding cakes. And they would only be for one man-one woman wedding. But they aren't. They're offering various cakes for different holidays for different people with different icing topics.Would you also agree it's fine for a cake company to refuse service to a couple that is non-white/white, disabled or foreign? Because if you do agree then it isn't about freedom of belief, it's about freedom to discriminate."
csjg017,doxaloxa,"There's a difference between refusing ANY service and saying ""I will make you a cake but I won't write (such and such) on it."""
csjg7e2,iph_tx,That's like walking into a Roman Catholic Church and forcing the devout Priest to marry you. And he will do it against his beliefs and will for fear of being taken to court for descrimination
csjgrq5,vallexum,"No, because his service is Roman Catholic weddings. He doesn't offer anything but, so he won't have to do a service he isn't offering.If he was a multi-faith minister who's service was to marry couples of different faiths then he'd marry couples of different faiths.The issue with modern church is that it is an entity, and what it says goes. Regardless if a person in authority of marrying couples wants to marry same-gender couples, they won't get to if the church says they can't. So why don't you ask ""why doesn't the church allow ministers to decide for themselves?"" religious people in authority of marrying couples are protected from such laws because the service they're offering can be exclusively for one man and one woman."
csjfz35,dirak,"You do not have the right to refuse service on only the basis of a protected class (race, and now sexual orientation)"
csjh1uu,egs1928,"You can refuse service for legitimate business reasons like health and safety (no shoes, no shirt, no service). You can't arbitrarily refuse service on grounds of a persons race, religion, age, sex or creed. So refusing service because someone is being a jerk or not wearing shoes is perfectly legit, refusing service because someone is black or Jewish is not."

csjfppd,JoruusCBaoth,"I've only read the summary of the opinion but it sounds like a bold, progressive and utterly human judgment. The kind of thing that gets you excited about what law can do.It's funny reading the dissenters bemoan the fact that the majority took it upon themselves to judicially invent a fundamental right rather than leaving it to the democratic process. That objection wasn't anywhere to be seen when it came to the recently-invented free speech rights of corporations."
csjgxya,egs1928,"Except for the fact that the Supreme Court itself has defined marriage as a fundamental right in 14 previous cases. Claiming this is some kind of manufactured right is akin to claiming that allowing blacks and whites to marry was some kind of fabricated right, equally absurd.The right wing of the court whines every time that their decision is not the majority that it's some kind of leap of unfounded judicial leap. They are becoming a joke."

Preventing stuff like that is what was really intended by separating church from state, but it is rarely viewed this way. Anyways really really happy right now."
csjfu2p,ender_wiggum,"I think the better solution would have been the government getting out of the marriage business altogether. Legal marriage in its current form is a tool for social engineering (tied to taxation, etc). Who I live with / sleep with / marry is none of the government's business."
csjgn47,egs1928,"Well it's the states business since the state is the legal entity enforcing the rights of marriage. Without them you have to go through the courts for things like inheriting your spouses property, joint custody of children, ability to make medical decisions for your spouse etc."
csjkbna,ender_wiggum,"The 'rights of marriage' are just arbitrary anyway. Disconnect the ceremony from rights. This would solve the same-sex issue as well as any more that ever emerge. All we've done now is made a change for a particular group.Example: not so long ago interracial marriage was illegal in many states - the Supreme Court fixed it, but ONLY that. We had to have the same fight all over again on essentially the same topic."
csjpqpw,egs1928,"The ceremony is non binding, it has nothing at all to do with the legal state of marriage. Marriage is a legal contractual agreement which the state is involved with as guarantor of those rights. The ceremony is utterly irrelevant.

Or it's within his right to decline.That doesn't mean the litter and I's marriage means anything in the eyes of state and federal law.Now states are forced to recognize marriage, regardless of the genders involved, and grant them marriage certificates."
csjgv2p,laughlines,Plenty of states wouldn't issue marriage licenses making it irrelevant whether a church would marry someone or not
csjgo19,RemusShepherd,"It was different in different states of the US. Same-sex marriage was legal in some places and illegal in others. Now it's legal country-wide.Churches probably still have the right to refuse to officiate a wedding. I'm not clear on that part yet. But all the states *must* issue marriage certificates to same-sex couples, and all you really need to be married is the certificate. The ceremony is optional."
csjgyk4,,Okay that sounds fair to me. I Have no problem with any of this. But if someone doesn't want to marry you they should be forced into it ya know?Nice progress for the gay community.
csjh89v,DrColdReality,"> Wait it was illegal?It still was in 13 states, yes. The number of states legalizing it has been growing for the last several years. Are you not aware of the injustice going on around you?A tad more accurately, gay marriages were *not legally recognized* in many places, it's not like the police would bust you for having a gay wedding. But the state would refuse to recognize it as a legal marriage, and that's the issue the court has ruled on.>I thought it was just up to the church whether they could do it or not? >Surely it's within their right to decline?It absolutely is, nobody is saying that any specific church *must* perform gay weddings if they don't want to.What churches DO have to do now is *legally recognize* gay marriages as real, legal things. If a church employs people and grants people in hetero marriages benefits or something, now they have to do the same for gay marriages. Freedom of religion does not trump civil law. For example, a church can't up and decide it wants to perform human sacrifices.There are *still* laws on the books in places that permit discrimination against gays in employment or housing."

csjgori,,A lot of my friends are. Being a republican doesn't preclude one from supporting same sex marriage. It just means that a good percentage of your opinions *probably* lean a certain way. A lot of republcians view marriage as something the government shouldn't be involved in anyway and fully support an individuals right to marry who they want since it's essentially just a contract between two consenting adults.

I just want to watch heads explode here in jacksonville florida. I just love how they are 3 and 4 times married have 4 kids from 5 fathers? But damnit don't want same sex marriage cause that would destroy its god ordained awesomeness.
csjgoam,jacoby531,"Wow, 14K upvotes in a little more than an hour."
csjgopv,hymness1,"This is truly unbelievable. I do not know much about US law system, but could there be any appeal on this? I certainly hope not!This is so a great news. I never thought I'd see this in my lifetime in the US. And I'm happy for all the homosexuals out there that have been waiting for so long for this moment."

csjgszv,cherijay,Im so happy for everyone who finally will be entitled to equal privileges that they have long been denied! The winds of change are blowing through America. Lets hope it keeps moving forward in a positive direction!Also.. more weddings = more cake. Win-win!

csjgtvl,Kingoflionbears,Fastest growing post ever?
csjgu61,akavana,So her is my question as someone who isn't as informed. Can the states create their own rulings on this matter? I live in Indiana and have seen some pretty appalling laws passed and enforced. Just wonder if there is a loophole a state will find to prevent the allowance of these laws and amendments.
csjh9js,faithdies,No. This decision will trump state law.
csjhmha,akavana,That's what I thought but we all know how states disapprove of this.
csjr7pg,TheDude415,Doesn't matter. The Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution explicitly states that federal law trumps state law.
csjleua,faithdies,Fuck 'em.

csjgv39,Bernie_Brewer,"I know this is a stupid question, but I can't seem to be googling the right terms......didn't we pretty much do this a few months ago? what am I thinking of?"
csjgzwu,dcm510,"Are you thinking of the repeal of DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act)? That said that it can't be banned on a federal level - but each state could decide individually. Since then, it's been a debate across the country in each state. Now, every state has to recognize marriage between two people of the same gender."
csjh33v,Bernie_Brewer,That's the one. Thanks boss!
csjgv5g,whatthefizzle,"So is this legalization final or can people appeal this decision? I'm pretty tired of this back and forth. Yes should mean yes, not ""yes, no, maybe, ok.. no"""
csjh7j6,faithdies,"Well...you can. But, it has to make it all the way back to them AND they have to agree to hear the case again."
csjhiqw,whatthefizzle,"So you're saying there's a chance.From what I read, gay marriage won 5-4. That sounds pretty close. It seems like all it takes is 1 person to change their mind and we're back to square one.They need to make gay marriage as legal as murder is illegal."
csjlgbd,faithdies,"Of course there's a chance. There's a chance that we re-institute slavery. But, the supreme court rarely will hear the same case twice. Especially not within close proximity."
csjhm22,hdhale,"It is final.Now that said...the Supreme Court could at some point in the future, perhaps decades from now, perhaps sooner, basically undo everything it just did."
csjr34j,TheDude415,Who would they appeal it to?
csjgvlp,raydialseeker,Refresh...5 more upvotes...refresh...5 more up votes
csjgvlz,,It is about time. Finally. Can we now make this a non issue during all elections? So tired of hearing about it and tired of seeing money spent by the government to push it either way.

csjh7dt,,"I don't understand how this ruling was MORE divisive than yesterday's ACA ruling. Equal protection under the law strikes me as absolutely non-negotiable - if the Feds are providing special treatment to heterosexual couples in the United States, they should provide the same treatment to homosexual couples.Maybe this would leave some ambiguity at the state level, but this reading doesn't seem controversial to me (disclaimer: IT guy, not legal scholar).On the flip side, ruling that a law's written meaning should be enforced by its *intended* meaning... I mean, what the fuck is the point of having these artfully crafted scrolls of legalese if the words DON'T mean what they say?"

She sat me down at the dinner table and she was very mature about it. She sat right across from me and she said, ‘Do you know how your father and I love each other?' And I said, 'Of course! You and Dad love each other more than any two people in the whole world.' And she said, 'Well, when two men love each other like that, and they can, they can love each other in the exact same way that your father and I love each other. What they do is they take off all their clothes, the get in a bed, and they SHIT ON THE BIBLE.' Bo Burnham"

csjhaia,Bronamedjoe64,"Wow that's awesome! This comment may get buried, but what does this mean for states like Kansas? Those who don't know our current governor just took away an anti discrimination law that the previous governor put in place. In Kansas it is now ok to discriminate against someone in the work force for sexual orientation. Will this new Supreme Court ruling change that, or is Kansas just stuck in their same way?"

csjhdq7,FlameOfWar,Does this mean that it will be legal for gays to be married in every state? So this is independent of the government?
csjhfz9,,Basically it means that state governments can't tell people they aren't allowed to get married because there is no legal basis for it.
csjhi09,Inverted-Hearts,"This means that same sex marriage will be recognized federally, regardless of state government ruling."
csjhkda,MoreDblRainbows,It says that marriage is a constitutional right. So the bans that some states now have are officially unconstitutional and unenforceable.

csjhp0q,,> Anyone who isn't a religious nut could see this is the right thing to do.Then how did Scalia surprise you here?
csjhnjb,absolutspacegirl,The comments on FoxNews.com are amazing.
csjho3t,Redskinsthebestskins,"I don't understand why marriage, hetero or homo, is any of the governments business in the first place. Its a contract between two people only. Not two people and the government. I dont understand why so many people are okay with the government controlling aspects of our personal lives. I get that gays weren't allowed to make decisions for incapacitated loved ones and other things like that, but that is a different issue."
csji8t4,Rosebunse,"Except that's sort of the point. Many gay couples do have to deal with making decisions and caring for their incapacitated loved ones, and they have to live in fear that there is something that will keep them from doing that.And then you have tax issues, adoption and custody issues, and probably a few other issues I'm forgetting about."
csjk0yt,Redskinsthebestskins,"Like I said, that is a different issue. Marriage is not defined by your ability to adopt children or make decisions for sick loved ones. Make it illegal to deny homosexuals those things. The government doesnt need to define marriage. *Marriage* isnt a government issue. Adoption, health, death, those are government issues."
csjk4r6,Rosebunse,"But marriage is the issue. Without marriage, it makes it harder to do those things because, the way the system is, it's designed for married couples."
csjmbr4,Redskinsthebestskins,"And my point is homosexuals should have always been allowed to marry, marriage should not be a government issue. If the Catholic Church didnt want to marry gays then thats their prerogative. You dont have to get married in a catholic church. It should have never been in the governments hands to begin with. What they should have done instead is prosecute those who deny ""marriage rights"", such as making health decisons, to homosexuals. Everything was done backwards. First gays got the right to make health decisions and then they were granted the right to marry."
csjnrot,Rosebunse,OK...Just seems easier and cheaper to let gay people marry.
csjid6b,exelion18120,>Its a contract between two people only.Do you not understand how contracts work?
csjjhi4,Redskinsthebestskins,Enlighten me
csjk1mm,exelion18120,There needs to be some kind of arbiter that makes sure that the terms of the contract are enforced. Without that a contract doesn't mean anything. For the US that arbiter is the government.
csjlsem,Redskinsthebestskins,"An arbiter has no contractual obligation. The contract is still between two people regardless if there is an arbiter. That'd be like saying my car loan is a contract between me, the bank, and the repossession guy. The repo man may enforce the terms of the terms of the contract, but he isnt a part of the contract."
csjho56,pisstones,"Wow! Supreme Court getting shit done this week! First, Obamacare gets uphold and now this. What a great day for America!"
csjhort,stuffylols,A new era is approaching
csjhpq2,Spankmybut,"Just imagine how happy all the people Who set up marriages are going to be right now, a sea of customers."
csjhqav,AntiHero2563,"Question. Will Christian pastors be forced to perform same sex marriages, or can they decline to do so? It wont be hard to find one that will do it but I'm sure these pastors won't be forced to go against their religious beliefs. Looking for clarification here."
csjhtxz,Axel927,Pastors can still decline under their 1st Amendment rights. This case focused on the issuance of marriage licenses. A state can no longer decline to issue a marriage license based upon the sex/sexes of the couple.
csjhvkn,AntiHero2563,"Welp, you cleared it up for me. Thanks."
csji37g,dapcook,I see this as a huge battle soon. I think the LGBT will go after pastor's who decline them and will litigate.
csji50p,Axel927,"That'd be a really, really hard case to win. The 1st Amendment is pretty tough to overcome."
csjih3f,loki8481,"this is settled law, pretty much, and wouldn't be any different than a church refusing to marry someone of a different religion, Catholic churches refusing to marry couples who were previously divorced, etc."
csjhvkm,Tzukiyomi,They do not have to do so. Military pastors are more complicated. Some non-church wedding sites will be required to be open for such ceremonies of course.
csjhxce,loki8481,"they can decline to do so, much like rabbis can't be compelled to marry a neo-Nazi coupe and Catholic churches routinely refuse to marry couples who have been previously divorced."
csji0r3,talidrow,"They're not forced to marry straight couples if they don't wish to do so. There is no danger any church, or any preacher, will be forced to marry a gay couple against his will.Basically the only people who might be required to marry gay couples whether they like it or not is government employees performing civil ceremonies, because it's part of their job description."
csji1za,Rosebunse,"That may be a state by state decision, but I'm sure they won't have to. Note, if you are thinking of getting married, there are many, many officiants who will do it for you without putting up a fight."

It seems in a way gay marriage should be recognized across the nation under one clause and then marriage definition laws thrown out under the equal protection clause. Anyone know?"

It basically says ""history has always defined marriage as one man and one woman, and since it isn't explicitly written into the 14th amendment, it should be a constitutional right"". Am I reading that right? The whole point of the Supreme Court is to clarify the constitution if it ever needs to be right? So by not stating ""including gays"" into the 14th amendment, it seems like a question that should totally be clarified by the SCOTUS."

csjkdkl,,">All four of the court's most conservative members — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. — dissented and each wrote a separate opinion, saying the court had usurped a power that belongs to the people.Point noted and it is a good one but would this stand in the way of voter action or legislation from also taking place? Could it not also be followed up as a separate political stream to solidify the decision of the people?"
csjkebs,notrelatedtoamelia,So how long will it take for the states to officially follow suit? Is this immediate as of today?
csjksov,dcm510,The states basically have to follow immediately. Some cities in Texas have already started issuing marriage licenses. Some cities/states are saying it will take a couple dates.

Or can conservative states still perform some fuckery to allow them to *not* abide by the ruling, like appeals or whatever? Is there some loophole that states are going to be able to not allow gay marriage on an individual basis, even if it's recognised by the government? Or is this whole issue completely over and done with, and every state now has legalized gay marriage and everything is good?I live in a very conservativy/republicany state with a lot of religious people, and while I can't believe this is still even an issue, I kind of imagine people will demand to secede rather than let gay people marry gay people. Because Jesus and the south will rise again and dinosaurs aren't real. So, apart from annexing themselves, does my state now allow gay marriage forever, or will there be legal appeals and much time-wasting?"
csjmle4,ojaldaconqueso,"It's a done deal in the sense that the only way it could be overturned would be via constitutional amendment, which would require a super majority in congress and ratification from 2/3s of states, which is *never* going to happen.

I mean, I strongly dislike most (ahem) of the dissenters, but (and don't crucify me for this!) I actually have some sympathy for their *legal arguments* on the first part. So I'd be very interested to see if they spoke directly to the second part...?Can someone help me out?Again, don't crucify me, here. I think gay marriage should be legal. I just wish our damned Congress had the will to make it the law of the land, without forcing the SCOTUS to do it."
csjmzaw,annoyingstranger,"Congress passing a law would've been a federal violation of states' rights, since Congress has jack-all to do with the issuing of marriage licenses."
csjp6de,VikingCoder,"Yeah, states really don't have rights like that.I mean, yes, it's an interesting theory - but Congress, the President, and the Supreme Court all disagree with your interpretation of the Constitution. And since those three bodies are the living embodiment of the Constitution, their opinion is what happens to matter in this country.I'm not saying your reading of the Constitution is *wrong.* I'm saying your reading is not the one this country has implemented."
csjpm0u,annoyingstranger,I'm confused. Are you saying there's no such thing as states' rights? Or that they're subject to federal oversight beyond what the Constitution empowers the federal government to do?
csjq6k8,VikingCoder,"> The Tenth Amendment, which makes explicit the idea that the federal government is limited to only the powers granted in the Constitution, has been declared to be a truism by the Supreme Court. In United States v. Sprague (1931) the Supreme Court asserted that the amendment ""added nothing to the [Constitution] as originally ratified.""> States and local governments have occasionally attempted to assert exemption from various federal regulations, especially in the areas of labor and environmental controls, using the Tenth Amendment as a basis for their claim. An often-repeated quote, from United States v. Darby Lumber, 312 U.S. 100, 124 (1941), reads as follows:> The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered. There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between the national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers not granted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Judicial_interpretationThe 10th is often cited to say the Federal Government is violating States' Rights. Or were you making another argument?"
csjqn9d,annoyingstranger,"I wasn't. The Constitution doesn't empower Congress to pass laws about marriage license distribution. The reason we had today's ruling was because the Constitution outlaws bans on same-sex marriage in the 14th Amendment, as violations of citizens' right to equal protection and due process."
csjqvsa,VikingCoder,> The Constitution **doesn't empower** Congress to pass laws about marriage license distribution. [emphasis added]That's a 10th argument. It really is.

csjnofw,talidrow,"Meh. He didn't explicitly threaten to set himself on fire, he just said he ""would burn if he had to"". I'm sure he's already writing a statement explaining how that was figurative and what he really meant was being burned by negative opinion blah blah etc.Which is a shame, really, 'cause it would have been entertaining.Now that couple that said they'd divorce if gay marriage became legal, that's a whole other thing. They were very clear and explicit with their threat, and it's up to them whether they go down in history as a couple of backwards bigots, or a big joke making empty threats."

csjpktj,Parsley_Sage,So could someone explain in brief the implications of this decision for us foreigners? Does this make it illegal to not grant a gay couple a marriage license for the reason of being a gay couple? Does it make it illegal to make a law baring gay couples from obtaining a marriage license? Or something else?
csjprzj,eliminate1337,"Technically what the Supreme Court did is ban the banning of gay marriage. All laws the prohibited it are now invalid, even if they're still laws on paper. Gay couples can get a marriage license anywhere starting right now."
csjpxub,historymajor44,"Sort of. Same-sex marriage bans are ""unconstitutional"". The state bans don't just disappear from the statutes until the state legislature removes it. So what happens if a gay couple is in Texas which still has the unconstitutional law on the books and is denied a marriage license? They sue. And win very quickly and likely get an injunction (court order) to get the license. It is not illegal per se the person denying them the license goes to jail or anything but if Texas really wanted to keep fighting gay marriage they would waste a large amount of money fighting and losing lawsuits."
csjq1pa,,[deleted]
csjqc53,historymajor44,Yes. They are. But they are still on the state statutes. They are invalid or unconstitutional. If a state enforces any law on their books that is unconstitutional the injured party must take them to court to get an injunction. I'm not saying the law needs to be challenged. We know they don't need to be challenged legally anymore. We know you can't ban same-sex marriage. Just like we know murder is illegal. But you still need to take someone to court if they commit a murder. You still need to take a state or clerk to court if they deny a marriage license to a same-sex couple.
csjpnh8,Axel927,> Does this make it illegal to not grant a gay couple a marriage license for the reason of being a gay couple? Yes.> Does it make it illegal to make a law baring gay couples from obtaining a marriage license?Yes.

Just mentioning civil rights turns into a slippery slope, one sided debate. I don't even want to argue about it, I've already heard the reasons people are against gay marriage, I just want to be happy for once. I'm surprised this even has to be an issue for people. If you aren't gay, who cares it isn't effecting you. You can still be happily married and straight and live with the same ideals you've always had. If you are gay? Congratulations, it's about time!"

csjqoqm,CVBrownie,The only strong argument anyone has presented me is that the legislative branch was circumvented. Can someone help me rip that apart?
csjrhv9,egs1928,"The legislative branch has no authority over marriage, the constitution leaves marriage specifically to the states. The states can regulate marriage as long as those regulations do not interfere with the rights guaranteed by the US constitution. The supreme court determined that laws restricting marriage from gays interferes with the 14th amendment and as such are not constitutional."
csjsbje,CVBrownie,Thank you. There's pretty much no arguing that.
csjqrvq,lucasmines,"The states have already voted on it. Some banned it, some passed it. Now that a majority had passed it, it was time for the Supreme Court to step in. There was no need for the legislative branch to get involved, as the federal government had previously left marriage to the states.The case that was brought was not about legalizing same sex marriage, but about equal protection under the 14th amendment, which is a federal issue as well."
csjqzv4,rainman_104,The legislative branch is still governed by the Constitution. What bothers me is they have the right to pass unconstitutional laws.

csjr2xz,electricmink,"It took nearly a hundred years to figure out owning human beings was wrong, nearly two hundred years to figure out racial discrimination, segregation, and barring interracial marriage was wrong, and around a hundred and fifty years to recognize women as equal citizens with a right to vote...so taking nearly 250 years to figure out the whole gay marriage thing is about par for the course. Unfortunately."

csjvrrw,godOmelet,"I hate to say this, but to my eye, the reason Roberts and the other ostensibly conservative justices voted this way is because it fits with the other seemingly ""progressive"" votes of the recent past. They give a sheen of social progress that really doesn't cut into the pockets of the *corporaternment* oligarchy. Watch for other decisions like this that run to popular trends in social 'awakening' that really bear very little upon the economic empowerment of ""unprivileged"" people. This is something that should have been a no-brainer, and better late than never, but I think we should not let the debate over ""lifestyle"" choices overshadow the real evils that continue to go under the radar in the corporate media while we still have a chance to alter the tsunami that engulfed the liberal principles that the founding fathers thought they had protected against corruption."

Interestingly enough, this is an expansion of sorts of the rights protected in the 14th amendment. I wonder if under the same legal reasoning....that other completely different topics can apply? Flat tax anyone? maybe not. http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf"
csk1k4y,wildpigeonchase,"I'm really shocked there was no delay, or ""stay"", in order to figure out bureaucratic issues. Even with tv and internet, there had to be a ton of cases where the clerks themselves hadn't even heard when people started coming in. Usually new laws/ruling have a short delay (24 hours, or start of next business day at least) until it takes effect to deal with informing everyone and making sure every courthouse has the right forms. I was a witness at my friends wedding last year, and the marriage license only had spots for (man) and (woman). The paperwork issue alone has to got to be mess today since a lot of places probably don't have the power to print new forms immediately.It was probably to prevent conservative states to find a way to weasel out of it, but still, there had to be a lot of confusion in courthouses today."

If a man can love and marry a woman, and also love and marry a man the why should he be discriminated if he loves two or more woman? Gay's say they were discriminated against because of who they couldn't marry who they wanted so why is it ok to discriminate again polygamist?"
csjldtw,faithdies,Google it. There are a lot of valid reasons that polygamy is illegal. It normally involves someone being taken advantage of.Gays were discriminated against since a right that 2 people had(a man and a women) were being refused to them.
csjowu5,tongchips,"You are right there are some polygamist who take advantage of people, however aren't there gay and straight people who take advantage of each other? I know a gay friend who has tried to take advantage of me when i was drunk, does that mean he shouldn't be married(btw he is married now and i was at the wedding)? Just because two people love each other doesn't mean 3 people can't love each other and doesn't mean they are always being taken advantage of. If you can expand the original meaning of marriage from a man and a woman to two people then why can't you change it again?"
csjswr2,faithdies,"Marriage was already legal. It just wasn't legal for some people. Polygamy is illegal for everyone. Also, if there was a groundswell of support for polygamy and it impacted a not insignificant portion of the population then maybe the law would change.This whole polygamy thing is a giant smokescreen anyway. Next, we'll be hearing the ""Why can't I marry my shovel""."
csji5iq,Running_From_Zombies,[Polygamy harms society](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/367/1589/657.full.pdf) in ways gay marriage does not.
csjk5gd,tongchips,"While I'll be honest, i didn't read the article you sent but i can find articles (whether correct or not) that show Gay harming society. I have this question for you. Assuming the article is true what does it matter, it is just a different group of people who are being discriminating against a group of people because the current mainstream culture doesn't agree with it (just like being gay was looked down upon). This is the argument the gay's made originally, right? So i'm not even for polygamy, but shouldn't we have the same standards across the board?"
csjkt3a,Running_From_Zombies,"> i didn't read the article you sent but i can find articles (whether correct or not) that show Gay harming society.As you didn't link to them, I assume they're flawed and heavily funded by religious groups.>Assuming the article is true what does it matter Assuming the article is true what does it matter, it is just a different group of people who are being discriminating against a group of people because the current mainstream culture doesn't agree with itIt's banned because it causes harm, not because ""mainstream culture disagrees with it"". If polygamy significantly harms society and the people within it by increasing crime, degrading women's rights, and promoting child deaths, then the restriction on polygamy is warranted and just."
csjp7ea,tongchips,"Wow that is a loaded statement that you make by labeling ALL polygamist like this, i remember people say the same thing about gay, please read history or ask a gay person. However the thing that shocked me the most was 'promoting child death' can you expound on that? I guess alternately you're saying that the inability to reproduce children naturally by gays is fine and won't have negative affects on global population. Once again i'm not saying i'm against gay's getting married, but they want equality (even if we don't understand) which seems to be what polygamist want too. Of course there are some bad polygamist out there just like there are bad gay people and bad straight people, lets not stereotype each group."
csjpoga,Running_From_Zombies,">However the thing that shocked me the most was 'promoting child death' can you expound on that?Source:>Polygynous marriages also create elevated risks of intra-household abuse, neglect and homicide because such households have lower average relatedness, and more unrelated dyads. Each additional wife is unre- lated to the existing co-wives, and to all of these wives' children. The number of unrelated dyads in such a household, in fact, increases with the square of the number of wives (see electronic supplementary material). Much empirical work in monogamous societies indicates that higher degrees of relatedness among household members are associated with lower rates of abuse, neglect and homicide [ 69 , 70 ]. Living in the same household with genetically unrelated adults is the single biggest risk factor for abuse, neglect and homicide of children. Stepmothers are 2.4 times more likely to kill their stepchildren [ 71 ] than birth mothers, and children living with an unrelated parent are between 15 and 77 times more likely to die ‘accidentally' [ 72 ].And:>Using data from nineteenth century Mormons, Heath & Hadley [ 25 ] compare data from 90 households consisting of 45 headed by wealthy men (top 2% of wealth in that community) and 45 headed by poor married men (from the bottom 16%). These data show that wealthy males had on average 3.2 wives compared to 1.4 among the poor. All but five of the wealthy men had more than one wife. One rich man had 11 wives. Over- all, the wealthy men controlled 120 women while the poor controlled 63. This means that 90 husbands had 183 wives, which implies roughly 93 missing men had no wives. While wealthy men had more total off- spring and longer reproductive careers (33 years for wealthy men compared to 22 for poor men), the chil- dren of poor men had better survival rates for their children to age 15. For poor men, 6.9 of their offspring(per wife) survived on average to age 15, while for wealthy men only 5.5 of their offspring (per wife) sur- vived to age 15. This is amazing, given that the poor men had less than 10 per cent of the wealth of the rich men--->Wow that is a loaded statement that you make by labeling ALL polygamist like thisBeing in a polygamous relationship, even a polygynous one, is no guarantee that they will abuse their lovers or neglect their children. There are always exceptions.But the statistics are what they are."
csjq41h,tongchips,"You are correct that the statistics are undeniable from the source you quoted. However as i read, this was from the 19th century so a study from over 200 years ago, 1800's to 1899, don't you agree that things have changed since then. Maybe if they came out with a study today they might find the opposite or the same, i can't say. Regardless they should have equal rights as others to marry and if they 'promote child death' or abuse or mistreat their kids/family they should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law which goes for gays and straights alike.PS. Thanks for this discussion, i appreciate your opinions whether we agree or not. (however I am against polygamy for the record)"

The first is from modern times.>Regardless they should have equal rights as others to marry and if they 'promote child death' or abuse or mistreat their kids/family they should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law which goes for gays and straights alike.I'd argue it's better to prevent crimes than punishing them after the fact. And I'd argue that the loss of rights from others (women and children) due to the existence of polygamy outweigh the right to polygamy itself."

Procreation occursthrough sexual relations between a man and a woman.When sexual relations result in the conception of a child,that child's prospects are generally better if the motherand father stay together rather than going their separateways.

In his first American dictionary,Noah Webster defined marriage as “the legalunion of a man and woman **for life**,” which served thepurposes of “preventing the promiscuous intercourse of thesexes, . . . promoting domestic felicity, and . . . securing the maintenance and education of children.” 1 An AmericanDictionary of the English Language (1828). An influential19th-century treatise defined marriage as “a civil status,existing in one man and one woman legally united **for life**for those civil and social purposes which are based in thedistinction of sex.” J. Bishop, Commentaries on the Law ofMarriage and Divorce 25 (1852). The first edition ofBlack's Law Dictionary defined marriage as “the civilstatus of one man and one woman united in **law for life.**”Black's Law Dictionary 756 (1891) (emphasis deleted).The dictionary maintained essentially that same definitionfor the next century.Emphasis added.

What Women's rights does it degrade exactly? It also doesn't have to lessen parental investment in children(It's really hard to make that argument anyway in the current state of marriage).A group of 4 people of equal genders would cause none of the issues you are describing, what you really are arguing against is the mass cultural acceptance of one-to many of a difference sex.

And->Polygynous marriageincreases competitionforwives,as married men remain on the marriage market. This increased competition drives down the age of first marriage for females and increases the spousal age gap. The reduced supply of unmarried women, who are absorbed into polygynous marriages, causes men of all ages to pursue younger and younger women. The competition also motivates men to use whatever connections, advantages or alliances they have in order to obtain wives, including striking financial and recipro- cal bargains with the fathers and brothers of unmarried females (see electronic supplementary material for North American examples). Once adolescent girls and young women become wives, older husbands strive to ‘protect' their young wives from other males (guarding the paternity of any offspring) and dominate household decision-making. More competition also motivates men to seek to control their female relatives (e.g. sisters), as demand for wives increases. This results in suppressing women's freedoms, increasing gender inequality and stimulating domestic violence.Lots of problems.>It also doesn't have to lessen parental investment in childrenIt statistically does.>A group of 4 people of equal genders would cause none of the issues you are describingLook here->Polygynous marriages also create elevated risks of intra-household abuse, neglect and homicide because such households have lower average relatedness, and more unrelated dyads. Each additional wife is unre- lated to the existing co-wives, and to all of these wives' children. The number of unrelated dyads in such a household, in fact, increases with the square of the number of wives (see electronic supplementary material). Much empirical work in monogamous societies indicates that higher degrees of relatedness among household members are associated with lower rates of abuse, neglect and homicide [ 69 , 70 ]. **Living in the same household with genetically unrelated adults is the single biggest risk factor for abuse, neglect and homicide of children.** Stepmothers are 2.4 times more likely to kill their stepchildren [ 71 ] than birth mothers, and children living with an unrelated parent are between 15 and 77 times more likely to die ‘accidentally' [ 72 ].It doesn't matter what sex the partners are."
csjkhwj,Delphizer,"Hmmmm, okay I'll stop arguing statistics w/e, I'm losing this battle.I'll try to argue emotionally.I happen to love two people, lets say those two people also love each other.

Are you saying I should be able to only legally be married to one of them, and the other should not be able to have any of the legal rights that the two of us have together? Does that sound right to you, to maintain some statistical ideal?A tri-bi relationship should negate your issues above, the fact that all three love each other would average out everyone's investment to each other. There is currently no law against step parents raising children so the argument that one part would care less for their technical step child shouldn't really be an argument. What's the argument against the above situation?"

Does that sound right to you, Yes. I unequivocally believe polygamous marriage, in any form, ought to be banned.>to maintain some statistical ideal?Let me try to argue emotionally as well. These statistics are *people*. People who are directly harmed by the existence of polygamy. Men, women, and children in their millions being abused, neglected, and subjugated. It's no coincidence that polygamy is legal in only the most backward and unfree societies today. But we don't have to have that here in our own towns and cities and nations. We can stop it now and forever, before it ever begins. And we are all the better for it, even those who wish to be polygamists.>A tri-bi relationship should negate your issues above, the fact that all three love each other would average out everyone's investment to each other.Being in a polygamous relationship, even a polygynous one, is no guarantee that they will abuse or neglect their children. There are always exceptions. But they are exceptions in an otherwise horrible practice.>There is currently no law against step parents raising children so the argument that one part would care less for their technical step child shouldn't really be an argument. Banning polygamy is easier and less intrusive than banning remarriages among those with children. We can't ban every practice that harms children, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't ban some. It's letting the [perfect get in the way of the good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_fallacy)."
csjmte5,Delphizer,"Our other thread has a better train of thought, although you are already kind of attacking it with the Nirvana Fallacy, but I feel my point stands. If similar set of societal negative statistics came out of gay/interracial marriage I don't believe you'd be holding to your stance.Women abuse/crime/neglected children/partners are all symptoms of a type of culture that takes poly relationships to an extreme. If there were an overall general culture shift and the above were less of an issue, would it suddenly be okay for poly relationships to be legal? Doesn't really seem the right way to handle the situation to me. If a culture shift can change a law, it shouldn't be a law in the first place."
csjnqkx,Running_From_Zombies,"> If similar set of societal negative statistics came out of gay/interracial marriage I don't believe you'd be holding to your stance.I don't believe banning gay or interracial marriage would be viable from a legal or social standpoint, in comparison to polygamy.It doesn't help that those kinds of marriages do not cause the same problems anyhow, making the hypothetical hard to answer since it involves disregarding what those marriages actually do.>Women abuse/crime/neglected children/partners are all symptoms of a type of culture that takes poly relationships to an extreme. If there were an overall general culture shift and the above were less of an issue, would it suddenly be okay for poly relationships to be legal? Polygamy inherently reinforces those cultural traits. If you are married to more than one woman, you are not going to value each wife as you would if you only had one. You have a surplus of women and they're inevitably treated accordingly. It's built into the system. And no amount of, ""Well, you *could* if you really, really wanted to"", changes the statistical facts.>If a culture shift can change a law, it shouldn't be a law in the first place.I don't think I understand. Everything I can think of that is banned now has, at some point, been legal. Murder, theft, slavery, you name it. Then, at different times and in different places, the culture changed. And it could very easily be changed back should the culture change again."
csjodps,Delphizer,"You are banning people from making a legal agreement with each other that other people can get for statistical reasons. It's not hard to imagine a situation where the culture could cause statistical issues. When interracial marriages first started people attacked them, that is crime. Crime increased because of interracial marriages because of the culture of people not liking interracial marriages. Lets say people REEALLY REEAAAALLY didn't like interracial marriages, hell that is still the case in some areas of the US, in those areas should interracial marriages be illegal because of the statistical ramifications of the increase in crime?In this situation I'd think most people agree that the focus should be on changing the culture than banning people from making that legal agreement."

csjpy3b,Delphizer,"The faults of some should not dictate the rules for all. I'm of a similar stance of recreational drugs/prostitution(Which I'm sure have their statistical downsides), but there are people that can handle it and it shouldn't be illegal for them. Your arguments feel similar to those coming from that type of camp. Your logic makes sense, I'm not arguing that nothing should be done about the negatives that can arise, I'm just saying using that logic to ban it outright irks me.People limiting themselves to loving only one person just feels wrong to me, it feels wrong in my core. A culture that see's this as ideal and actively pushes against it feels unjust in and of itself.So most people use it as some form of sexual farm house of slave like Women. Lots of people are drunks and use alcohol horribly, does that mean I can't enjoy a nice social buzz with my friends?"
csjrkxz,Running_From_Zombies,"> I'd argue that the culture of only trying to find one lifelong partner is in and of itself a horrible culture.You're free to hold that opinion.

And the evidence, what little we have, shows monogamous relationships are better.>The faults of some should not dictate the rules for all.I'm sure there are vigilantes who don't make mistakes or descend into mobdom. But it inherently, due to the way it works in practice, causes too much abuse and harm to be allowed.>Your logic makes sense, I'm not arguing that nothing should be done about the negatives that can arise, I'm just saying using that logic to ban it outright irks me.For myself, I don't want to tamper with one of the most important social units our society has to appease polygamists, a minority of whom can get polygamy to work, when the harm is great for everyone else. Especially when there is no evidence that it helps society at all, even the total freedoms in society (since you degrade women's rights), and plenty against. The cheapest and most unintrusive-upon-our-rights fix to the evils of polygamy is banning it. You can make the argument that isn't true for drug criminalisation, but I don't see it for polygamy."

If a gay couple wants to commit themselves to each other for the rest of their life and be miserable like the rest of us, more power to them. Why is it my place to say they can't do it. That's one of the problems with our country. People just need to mind their own business."

The citizens who supported the measures in the last remaining States will still discriminate against gays. We are acting as if the Federal Govt can change people's minds here. Gays are still unfortunately the most universally hated minority group

In this case, lots of rainbows."
csjnlxg,jevchance,This is a huge win for divorce lawyers everywhere.
csjnt77,TheRealSoCalBeast,"So here's an interesting argument to ponder. What does this do to the idea of plural marriage? If marriage is now a fundamental civil right for all, and can longer be defined as between 1 man and 1 women, does this open the door to the possibility of plural marriage? If all parties are consenting adults, from a legal stance could you make an argument for PM?"
csjo2aa,,"I think in a way yes but there would have to be some kind of limit. I think it's more an argument for the idea that the state shouldn't have anything to do with marriage.If they allowed this some cult-like entity would take advantage. I could see the entire ""School of Ramtha"" getting married for example. It's just too problematic."
csjrhg3,SkullLeader,"No, its an equal protection issue (i.e. 14th amendment).If you say its legal for Hispanic women to have driver's licenses, you have to let everyone else have them too, else the law does not apply to everyone equally and the 14th amendment prohibits that.If you say some people can marry the one person of their choosing, but not everyone can, then again, the law does not apply to everyone equally and the 14th amendment prohibits that.If you say some people can marry multiple other people, but some people may not, then again, the law would not apply to everyone equally and that would be prohibited by the 14th amendment.But, because currently the law precludes anyone from marrying multiple people, the law applies to everyone equally and the 14th amendment is not at issue when it comes to polygamy at this time. The whole polygamy / slippery slope argument is just silly because not only is it invalid on its face (see above), but its absurd - like saying if we grant women the right to vote, next we'll have to grant the right to vote to dogs, and after that, to cats. But, now that gay marriage is legal, if you want, for no good reason, to live in perpetual fear of the apparently imminent coming of the Age of Bigamy (and, I guess, the apocalypse that will be following shortly behind) be my guest."
csjs5lk,TheRealSoCalBeast,"I think you're confused with what I'm asking. I'm not saying that people should and some people shouldn't, rather that everyone would have the opportunity to do so at their choosing."
csjsle9,SkullLeader,"Well, then let me ask you a question - why do you think this decision will lead to polygamy, or makes it more likely? My point is that really the whole gay marriage victory was basically - ""you let straight people marry one person, you have to let gay people marry one person too"" - but since no one is currently allowed to marry multiple people, there's no argument along the same lines there i.e. ""you let them marry more than one person, you have to let me marry more than one person too!"""
csk2jx5,TheRealSoCalBeast,"The basis of the argument against gay marriage was that the bible defined marriage as between one man and one woman. Based on today's ruling the SCOTUS has determined that marriage is a basic civil right that cannot be denied. It did not define marriage as only between two individuals so if marriage is a basic civil right, why can't one man be married to two women or one woman to two men? How is that not a violation of ones rights?"
csjnufh,sharlequin,"In all seriousness, as long as they don't force priests to marry them, I have no problem with this."
csjo322,macaco_gordinho,"Here is where the challenge comes though. Marriage is a legal action. To legally marry someone you have to have permission from the state in which you marry people. It's against the law to discriminate. So essentially a priest could perform a ceremony and then a third party legal entity would complete the documentation. It's the same issue with the baking a cake thing. If you are a business you are not allowed to discriminate based on beliefs. If you could, then a racist could say I won't provide goods or services to people of certain race."
csjo87o,sharlequin,"Marriage is a legal action, but it does not have to be done at a church. A strictly religious place should most definitely not be forced to marry two people that the priest deems sinful, that is something that needs to stay with the christians."
csjp04a,macaco_gordinho,"Then the priest can not perform the legal action of signing legal documents stating a couple is married. Most priests who perform the wedding are also the one who legally marries them by signing the documentation. Would someone force a priest to perform an wedding? Highly doubtful. But under the legal aspect, you can not perform a fucntion or role for the government and discriminate."

csjor6w,Sir__Walken,So how does this effect the churches. I know that is the main argument that people had because they didnt want to be forced to marry anyone that was gay because it is against their beliefs. Is that happening or are they allowed to refuse?
csjowe4,absynthe7,"That was something that was literally never true. I'm in Mass, where gay marriage has been legal for a long time, and no church or minister has ever been forced to perform a gay marriage. This argument has always been misdirection, and you should never again trust the people who told it to you."
csjpf9s,Sir__Walken,"Oh, don't take my question the wrong way. I love that this happened. Now my mom can get married! I just know people that are real bible thumpers and go crazy about this stuff. If i tell them that it won't affect them then i don't have to hear them complain. Haha!"

That being said, as a straight male, I don't ever plan to get married. I honestly don't know any happily married men. I predict that in 5-10 years divorce law will have a huge boom in business because lets face it, people get tired of each other, people do fucked up things to each other. ~50% of marriages end in divorce. Man it is a good time to go to law school."
csjri1v,neoblackdragon,Happily married men don't complain about being happily married. Also it's important to understand WHY people get to the point of needing a divorce. It's not because they get tired of each other usually. At the same time you need to understand why you should get married. You can have kids and not be married. You can own a house together and not be married. Hell some couples are married and have an open marriage. Others are inseparable and other death can actually end the relationship. But if it's just something you are supposed to do............well that's a piss poor reason to get married.
csjrvni,javi404,I'm with you. Getting married for tradition is retarded. I already have kids and they could care less about me being married or not. I'm in an LTR and no one in unhappy about it.

csjm71i,Pandemic21,"Was gonna reply with this. I came to a realization one day that there's literally no reason I can think of that polygamy is morally wrong or should be illegal. There needs to be protections in place so that you don't end up with one guy and twenty wives, all of whom he views as less than him, but that can probably be solved"
csjfqzs,southern_boy,That's an odd leap... Marriage is a union between two people. In America it is a union between two consenting adult citizens. The Supreme Court has ruled that a consenting American adult can marry any other consenting American adult they so choose... Where does polygamy play into that?
csjokxd,ilessthan3math,"Well up until recently it was union between a man and a woman. I think he's making the point that there is a slight bit of hypocrisy in saying that you are for gay marriage but that polygamy is appalling. For instance, here are some perhaps familiar arguments for legalizing polygamy: - It doesn't affect you, why should you care? - Just because your beliefs do not align with mine should not mean I cannot make my own choices - We love each other and that is all that really matters. - We just want the same rights as everyone else - We are consenting adultsNote: I am 100% in support of the legalization of gay marriage, and I am not in any way, shape, or form a polygamist. I simply understand the logic of where /u/SlitSlayer is coming from on this topic."

Long term, committed heterosexual relationships that by nature reproduce and raise the next generations has been called marriage for thousands if years. Now people want to call homosexual commitments marriage as well but they aren't really marriages because they aren't the same as real marriages. You can call them marriages or whatever you would like but they still aren't the same institution."
cskqhi2,mallio,"Say you have a tree and a bush. Another culture may say you have two trees, just different sizes.Those are physical things though, marriage is just a concept. In the past it was a business transaction, now it is an expression of love. It has never had a constant definition."

csjj6s1,timmymayes,"No. Its different in the faculty of the number of people involved. It would have implications on taxation, insurance etc. I am fine with polygamy being legal, but spousal rights need to be defined so as to not allow a ""gaming"" of the system. Allowing gay people to marry doesn't mess with the numbers. Allowing polygamy means you could marry 1000 people, what affect does that have on taxes and the financial sector?"

csjq3ob,chaos750,"Despite what same-sex marriage opponents claim, legalizing same-sex marriage really doesn't change the fundamentals of marriage itself. It's mostly a matter of replacing ""man and woman"" with ""two people"" in the first sentence, and the rest of the law still make sense. We've moved past the time where men and women were treated differently in a marriage, so there isn't much to do other than remove that one restriction. It's not like there are substantial questions like ""but if they're both men, which one is allowed to have a job and which one is going to stay at home? The law doesn't account for this!"" Polygamy is a very different proposition with lots of unanswered questions. We can't just remove the word ""two"" and start issuing licenses. For example, if A marries B, and B marries C, are A and C married now? If so, can A use C's health insurance, or collect Social Security benefits? What if A and B get divorced, is C involved at all? How will we deal with the people who inevitably try to break world records and get as many people involved in the same marriage? Fun fact, if you're married to someone, you can't be forced to testify against them in court. So what happens when the entire mafia marries each other? And of course, what in the world happens to the tax code?Now, none of these questions is impossible to answer. One could draft up a law defining polygamous marriage, and specifying how it interacts with existing law. But it would *have* to be an almost entirely new law, not just a slight change. There's not much difference between a man and woman pair versus a man and man pair. But there's a whole lot of difference between a pair and an [arbitrary graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_\(mathematics\)), and it would require a lot of work to make those changes."

csjndqs,graphictruth,"Skimmed the paper. I dryly note that someone writing from a patriarchal, polygamous viewpoint would view all the downsides the paper cites as *features,* citing the advantages given to eventual offspring resulting from increased competition. In practice, customs vary over time, according to conditions. For instance, current demographics in China would advantage polyandrous and male same-sex relationships in order to meet social and emotional needs. My point is that it's a personal relationship. The persons involved get the only vote that counts. >Specific to cheating: it's a betrayal of your spouse.Only if that's part of the agreement between spouses. It's certainly not something anyone - particularly a government - has the right to *assume* on our behalf. How do you think couples with significant mismatches in sex drives cope, anyway? And what about cultures where it would be socially embarrassing for both spouses for the husband to NOT have a mistress? Polygamous cultures don't think of it as ""betrayal."" And regardless of what you and I may think of what goes into them thinking that way - I should also point out that I think pretty much the same about what I glean of your thinking on the issue - and probably the reverse is true. So should either of us get to define the others' marriage in order to make ourselves comfortable?"
csjod6m,Running_From_Zombies,"> My point is that it's a personal relationship.Legal marriage requires recognition from the state. As it is, you can have as many personal partners as you want. I imagine you could claim you're ""spiritually"" married to them, if you so wished. But legal marriage is not merely a personal relationship due to its need of recognition. More over, if the is practice harmful, especially to others, the votes of the direct participants are not the only ones that count.>Only if that's part of the agreement between spouses.Of course. And if you cheat, there wasn't. If there was, I refer you to the previous study which has some overlap with unrecognised polyamory relationships.>So should either of us get to define the others' marriage in order to make ourselves comfortable? Society has a duty to protect and promote the welfare of its citizens.

That's not the case with laws regarding adultery (to the extent that they still stand.)Society does indeed have a duty to protect against known and demonstrable harms.

csjp71z,Running_From_Zombies,">The ""child abuse"" I could possibly see in that a parent doesn't spend as much time with their kid as they would have if there were only two, but I have serious doubts that having more than one spouse promotes murderSource:>Polygynous marriages also create elevated risks of intra-household abuse, neglect and homicide because such households have lower average relatedness, and more unrelated dyads. Each additional wife is unre- lated to the existing co-wives, and to all of these wives' children. The number of unrelated dyads in such a household, in fact, increases with the square of the number of wives (see electronic supplementary material). Much empirical work in monogamous societies indicates that higher degrees of relatedness among household members are associated with lower rates of abuse, neglect and homicide [ 69 , 70 ]. Living in the same household with genetically unrelated adults is the single biggest risk factor for abuse, neglect and homicide of children. Stepmothers are 2.4 times more likely to kill their stepchildren [ 71 ] than birth mothers, and children living with an unrelated parent are between 15 and 77 times more likely to die ‘accidentally' [ 72 ].And>degradation of woman rightsSource:>Polygynous marriageincreases competitionforwives,as married men remain on the marriage market. This increased competition drives down the age of first marriage for females and increases the spousal age gap. The reduced supply of unmarried women, who are absorbed into polygynous marriages, causes men of all ages to pursue younger and younger women. The competition also motivates men to use whatever connections, advantages or alliances they have in order to obtain wives, including striking financial and recipro- cal bargains with the fathers and brothers of unmarried females (see electronic supplementary material for North American examples). Once adolescent girls and young women become wives, older husbands strive to ‘protect' their young wives from other males (guarding the paternity of any offspring) and dominate household decision-making. More competition also motivates men to seek to control their female relatives (e.g. sisters), as demand for wives increases. This results in suppressing women's freedoms, increasing gender inequality and stimulating domestic violence."

csjo3tm,silentxem,"Much of these data are taken from cultures where only men are allowed to take multiple partners, where women already have fewer rights, and where there is pervasive misogyny, and there is an assumtption that men are the *only* ones who would have multiple partners in a non-monogamous relationship in all of the other data. There is no information on the effects of multiple partner relationships in a culture where gender equality is valued, no one is being coerced into marriage, and the primary reason for marriage is because these people actually love each other, not because a woman has to get married in order to survive.In any case, I don't think marriage is quite the appropriate institution for a multiple-partner relationship such as in polyamory or polygamy. There needs to be a different sort of contract between all participants in order for it to work legally.And let's not forget that I didn't mention marriage at all, only that there is nothing inherently wrong with more than two people being in a romantic relationship together. I have been in and know others in non-monogamous relationships, none of which were hurting anyone. I did not feel that I was being oppressed, or that my partner did not respect me. In fact, I am more comfortable without all the pressure of being someone's everything. I was happy and the relationship was healthy.So yes... there are many examples of polygamy in places where institutional misogyny is powerful, and yes, that sort of situation is not conducive to a healthy relationship... but that is a totally separate issue from whether or not it is inherently immoral to love two people romantically, and to act on those feelings with consenting adults."
csjowmv,Running_From_Zombies,">Much of these data are taken from cultures where only men are allowed to take multiple partners, where women already have fewer rights, and where there is pervasive misogynyYes, funny how that is. Funny and revealing of how polygamy generally evolves.> There is no information on the effects of multiple partner relationships in a culture where gender equality is valuedWhile true, it is because no such society exists, or at least not at any level where it can be easily measured. It's important to remember that polygamy reinforces such behavior: If you are married to more than one woman, you are not going to value each wife as you would if you only had one. You have a surplus of women and they're inevitably treated accordingly. It's built into the system.>And let's not forget that I didn't mention marriage at all, only that there is nothing inherently wrong with more than two people being in a romantic relationship together.There is some overlap between polygamy and polyamory in how they function in society (competition between lovers, hoarding of resources for their own real children, etc). But it's not 1:1, and I don't claim it to be.>I was happy and the relationship was healthy.Being in a polyamorous relationship, even a polygynous one, is no guarantee that they will abuse their lovers or neglect their children. There are always exceptions.But the statistics are what they are."

csjord1,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,"A leader? No, they came 17th my friend. Which is still in front of many other country's but how are you going to claim that america had anything to do with Iceland legalizing back in 2010 for example?"
csjpwon,Bogey_Redbud,"Because Vermont legalized it in 2000. Followed by many states prior to 2010. An American state was the first to legalize it before any nation. If Iceland was ran like America, divided by 50 independently ran states, then yes, you would have an argument. But it was an American state that got there first and set the precedent. http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/same-sex-marriage-laws.aspxhttp://www.pewforum.org/2015/06/26/gay-marriage-around-the-world-2013/"
csjq1dc,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,"Well, yay, for Vermont then, but that's them leading, not ''the US''. It's either independent states making decisions or the nation, you can't have your cake and eat it too."
csjqbn9,Bogey_Redbud,"That's easy to say when you are talking about a country like Iceland with a population just over 300k. While Vermont has double that. And that's the point. America's population is larger than most of the nations that have allowed it. And my point is it was an American state that set the precedent. It's funny how when something crazy Texas or Florida does, reddit goes big on anti-America shit. Then when an American state does something awesome, suddenly we hear your argument."
csjqttf,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,"''Reddit this, reddit that'' talk to the individual you're talking to man, don't turn it into a you vs. reddit thing where everyone else is just ''reddit''. I've never ''gone big on anti-America shit'' when a state does something. I'm just saying if you say the US lead the way that would imply that the US government was first or at least among the first, or maybe that american culture was among the most tolerant for homosexuality and lead the way that way. In reality the US government came in 17th place on this issue and there's still a LOT of homophobia in the US compared to other places, for example Iceland. And yes that's also true if you adjust for per-capita, you can't chalk everything up to population size.Vermont lead the way legally speaking yes, and that's great, and what America did today was also great and they are a great nation and not nearly as backwards or bigoted as people sometimes make them out to be, but you can't just go around giving them the credit for anything good that happens in the world either. ''16 other nations legalized same sex marriage federally earlier? Well I'm sure it was still thanks to America in some way''"
csjv920,Bogey_Redbud,"An American state lead the way. Better? The fact of the matter is, yes per capita matters. You're trying to compare the nation of Iceland to America. You can't do that. The state with the smallest population still has 200k more people than Iceland. Our states are almost as if they are independent nations held together by one big entity. Think of it like the EU. We even have a district (Washington DC) and cities with more people than Iceland. We have territories that have more people. So that's awesome Iceland was able to get 300k people to agree on something. Try getting over 300 million to agree on something. Our country is set up in a way that ensures state rights all protected under the federal government. The fact that America could get this federally passed would be like the entire EU passing something like this. This is unprecedented. And as I have said, an American state got there first. Over double the size of Iceland was able to agree on this 10 years prior to Iceland. Five years prior to Canada. So, yes, myself and many other will say that America was leading the way."
csjme8j,W_T_Jones,He didn't say anything about other nations. He talked about the 21st century. The century is still young but equalization of homosexual people could very well turn out to be a 21st century thing.

csjk3j4,,"No, not really. When you're the last of those nations to get there then clearly you're not the leader in that push.Most nations passed gay marriage laws without very little fuss."
csjm075,Bogey_Redbud,"First off, do you only think there are 17 nations? If we are the last and 17 were prior...Secondly, before any nation legalized same sex marriage, Vermont was there first: http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/same-sex-marriage-laws.aspxhttp://www.pewforum.org/2015/06/26/gay-marriage-around-the-world-2013/We are a unique nation in that we have 50 autonomous states that are allowed to make up their own rules so long as they are constitutional. This makes progress as a whole for the nation slower, or appear slower. I know it's cool to always hate on America. But as you can see from the links I provided, Vermont legalized it prior to any nation."

csk3b89,dcman00000,"I want to add to the discussion from the other side. I'm not against gay marriage, but I want to bring to light what I think are important points that Scalia talks about. I beleive that he has been unfairly pigeonholed as some kind of reactionary maniac, and although he is abrasive for sure, He brings up points that are no less substantive and no less important to our society and our system of government...This is what he says in his dissent more or less. Here is the link, he starts on page 69. http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf* He talks about legal precedent being demolished here because it has been regarded as a state right for a long time* He talks about a literal plain meaning of the due process clause does not create a right for gay marriage (he's right, but the majority didn't use a plain meaning of the due process clause)* He talks about how any reasonable interpretation of the constitution leaves the issue of marriage in the ninth and tenth amendments...basically meaning that either the people (through representatives for example) or the states themselves are reserved this right. In a purely literal sense he's probably right. But agian the majority didn't use the plain meaning of the text, they used what is colloquially known as ""living breathing document"" legal reasoning. * He talks about how vague issues in the constitution and law are reviewed under what evidence there is to the original intent of those who wrote the law meant. Under this review there is no evidence that in the decades following the ratification of the 14th amendment that the generation that ratified the amendment intended this to mean anything other than the plain meaning of the text. So yeah, its actually more in depth than what the news organizations are leading on, and what is being linked to here on Reddit. In full disclosure **I support gay marriage**, but I can't necessarily disagree with the legal reasoning that scalia put forth. He's basically arguing that the integrity of the constitution was harmed by this decisions, which is an important co-consideration on this case. I believe that to protect our constitution, and our heritage of freedom, democracy, and the principals upon which our society is based than this was the wrong way to do so. So how else do you ask we should've done this? A state by state change would have sufficed, but perhaps would have taken longer ( I grant you that). It would have preserved our constitution in the process however, which is always a good thing, including for our gay brothers and sisters. Another way is through a constitutional amendment, that gave an explicit constitutional right to gay marriage, much harder to achieve, but also protects our constitution and legal system (common law and precedent) in the process. I figured I'd chime in, not because I am against gay marriage (I'm not), but because this discussion on the decision I feel misses important parts of this dissent. Undoubtedly, Scalia has been unfairly pigeonholed as some kind of crazy reactionary by reddit and the media, but this ignores important points I believe he brings up. Essentially what I'm saying is that we should celebrate todays decisions in the sense that freedom won out. However we must also be aware of the pitfalls of the legal reasoning used by the majority, and how problematic that can be to our society and our constitution."
csk44rm,acideath,If the constitution has difficulty addressing such simple concepts then it is even more outdated and worthless than I thought. It is not an infallible all seeing manuscript written by perfect demigods.
csk4hvh,dcman00000,"It doesn't have any trouble addressing it. It gives a list of enumerated powers (which were added to by some amendments), and then in the ninth and tenth amendments says that any powers not explicitly stated are hereby reserved to the states or the people. At least by a plain meaning of the text interpretation thats the case.The majority decision used the ""living breathing document"" philosophy.I know that there is a lot of consternation for many people when they here arguments like mine, but it is still important to consider, because if the law that binds us through the constitution is meaningless and can be interpreted to mean anything a judge is clever enough to interpret...then in effect the law means nothing. If the law doesn't bind us to the constitution and its meaning, then in effect no law binds us if we so choose and are clever enough."
csk4cxm,radialomens,"You'd do well to read /u/aenigmatix's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3b6zln/supreme_court_legalizes_gay_marriage/csjr03a) which already explained how the SCOTUS has the precedence to make this decision whilst ""protecting the constitution."""
csk4kz5,dcman00000,That is actually pretty good. I'm going to copy and paste what I said to reply to him and see what he says.
csk5igm,Zooicide85,"If marriage rights were really a states' right, as you claim, wouldn't it have really been abolished as such 60 years ago when the supreme court legalized interracial marriages in all the states?"
csk91t5,dcman00000,"Yes you would be correct really. I just read through the opinion on that case....which was unanimous... they said this at the end> Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.That is pretty clear cut supreme court decision. And I totally agree with people being able to get married between races, just as I do with gay people getting married. Matter of fact I also support multiple consenting adults getting married. But thats not my point. My point is that the court has a tendency to overturn...sometimes decades of precedent with one ruling. Sometimes it does so with good intentions (as is the case with these rulings). Sometimes it gets it horribly wrong though, and as such there is also always the potential for judicial abuse on these cases. It is...in my opinion... fundamentally against what a democracy and republic is supposed to be when 9 unelected judges implement defacto legislation and defacto constitutional amendments when they feel it suits their purposes. We already have venues to do these things, and they are through the constitutional ammendment processes at the state and federal levels, as well as implementing relevant legislation when appropriate. To have 9 unelected judges make these decisions on behalf of 320 million Americans, and with little regard to their elected representatives...doesn't sound very democratic to me."
csksr78,Zooicide85,"I suppose it is somewhat undemocratic. But you should keep in mind that we don't live in a true democracy, we live in a republic. When it works well, one of the best things about a republic as opposed to a pure democracy, is that it prevents the tyranny of the majority. Homosexuals are and always will be a minority, and that their equality is being recognized by our government is, I think, republicanism at its finest."
cskwwyq,dcman00000,"Absolutely, I agree with that everything you're saying.I'm just focused on the constitution, and that there were better ways to do this...thats all"
csk6uaw,Sao_Gage,"I mean no disrespect to anyone or any viewpoint, but I never understood where this idea came from that the Constitution is somehow inherently infallible. Just like laws are created by man, who is flawed. Therefore laws can be flawed."
csk8hrd,dcman00000,"Oh, its not to mean that it is perfect. Rather this is about the integrity of the law.Picking and choosing when to and when not to follow the letter of the law leads to uncertain precedents (we are a common law nation) and helps promote your legal opponents to do the same.For example if you are not bound in certain cases by the *literal* meaning of due process and instead take an expansive view of that to mean it extends to gay marriage (as was the case here), then if I so choose maybe in the future....once I get enough clever justices on the court and a relevant case...perhaps I can interpret the right to a fair and speedy trial to have conditions (it is basically unconditional now for U.S citizens). Or perhaps I will overturn legal precedent set by cases like Roe V wade. Thats the type of legal integrity I'm talking about. If you can flaunt the law by doing such a thing, then it makes it more likely others you disagree with will also do the same."

You are just replacing the word ""black"" with the word ""gay"" and you have the same foundation of Loving v. Virginia.While there are some rules regarding age of consent, those largely level out along the scale. Gender based rules do not level out over time like age of consent.In the end you are saying that states rights should trump federal law, but then you draw the line at individual liberties that do no harm to another do not trump states rights.

csk013f,glitterinwonderland,Except the Supreme Court just said that it violates the constitution to have such a law that bans gay marriage. Unless you think states should be allowed to disregard the constitution.
csk11nz,,[deleted]
csk369t,glitterinwonderland,So you think that the Supreme Court should allow states to violate the constitution and hope they stop violating the constitution on their own? Or are you trying to make some sort of slippery slope argument here? That if they do it in this case then they will do it in other cases?
csk3dg2,,[deleted]
csk3q07,JogBikeSwim,"You just had this question answered... The Supreme Court is responsible for interpreting laws and determining their constitutionality. They ruled that the constitution guarantees a right to gay marriage. If a state passes a law contrary to the constitution, then they're violating the constitution. Similar to how a state can't decide to outlaw free speech, they can't outlaw gay marriage because doing so is contrary to the constitution."
cslghza,plsnogod,"Guess we can't disagree with the supreme court then! I've heard this argument countless times before, it doesn't get any less stupid."
csk3w39,glitterinwonderland,"It states one constitutional issue in the opening of the decision which is the fourteenth amendment. ""No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."""
csjwty9,etommy13,"I disagree. This entire country was founded on ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" The concept of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness should be upheld under any and all circumstances regardless of the state. If Thomas Jefferson added the phrase ""depending on various circumstances and state laws"" on the end, that would be one thing."

csjy24d,etommy13,"I never said it was law. I stated it was a principal which this entire country was founded on. That principal in no way prevents states from making laws. As for the constitution they key phrase is ""the powers NOT delegated to the U.S. by the Constitution..."" The entire process which you are complaining about are in fact granted to the U.S. by the Constitution. The Supreme Court can rule on these matters and they are appointed by presidents while other elected officials are voted in. That was the design."
csjy56h,,[deleted]

csk16z8,derbyvoice71,"As a libertarian, how do you then reconcile that states rights are more important than federal law regarding certain matters but also trump individual liberty with regard to a person exercising said same when it does not infringe upon the rights or freedoms of another person?In the end, and I don't suggest that this is your thinking, so many people's objections to this boil down to ""I think it's icky that two people with the same plumbing do that,"" or ""marriage is a religious rite and MY religion has a problem with gays."" What this does is set a certain subset of people above another subset of people with regard to a civil contract and institution that the government gives benefits to (tax, life-care, etc.). Libertarian should not stop at the idea that Statism is bad, but a state (small s) can act in an arbitrary manner to deny a right given to others. That's not libertarian; that's bullshit."

csjidrb,talidrow,"The problem with that is that when there are any number of laws and benefits tied into the legal concept of marriage, having some states choose not to recognize marriages that are perfectly legal in another state is a problem.""Oh, you were in an accident/had a medical emergency and want your spouse to be able to visit you in the hospital and make medical decisions while you're unable to do so?

csjt2rh,,Aside from a lot of religious people who support this action.Fun fact: I'm against homosexuality as a Christian but all for equality under law for same-sex marriage. That's proper Christianity right there.
cskc27q,olican101,are you also against cutting hair and divorce?
cskcqho,,"No, and that's irrelevant."
cskjrg2,olican101,Both those things are sins just as much as homosexuality. I am glad that you feel that your religion shouldn't affect others but Christianity isn't that black and white. The Christian church in the UK supports homosexuality.
cslda4d,,"> Both those things are sins just as much as homosexuality.You'll need to back that up with biblical evidence and show that you're not confusing the general concept of sin with God's laws for Israel.> The Christian church in the UK supports homosexuality.That's just plain ignorance of the nature of Christianity itself. We have dozens of denominations that all approach homosexuality differently, with more biblically-grounded groups accepting the bible's definition of the act of homosexuality as a sin (as you hypocritically write in your comment), while some more liberal groups read more loosely into the parts of the Word of God that support the former approach. As for myself, I'm a non-denominational Christian who simply works out what to believe through my personal relationship with God through his Word. I don't have to fall into your faulty grouping of 'the Christian church' when Christianity is such a varied faith and when my beliefs are not dictated by any human leadership, group trend or majority.If a Christian defines something as a sin, they're not going to 'support' that sin. They'll support the people sinning it that way, but not the sin itself, and often support of the sinner means opposing their sin. I won't help a robber rob a bank, I won't help a prostitute have sex with anyone who calls, and I won't help a homosexual friend be homosexual if I view their homosexuality as disobedient to God's Word."
cslgzz4,olican101,"Every christian is different, but they all follow the same book. WBC is obviously taking the bible more seriously than most. And the church in the UK called for gay marriage under ""we are all gods children, god made some people gay"" I fail to see why you can not be against the sin of divorce or cutting hair but can be against homosexuality. Divorce: And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery, (Matt. 19:9)But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. (Matthew 5:32)Cutting hair:They shall not make bald patches on their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts on their body. (Leviticus 21:5)I'm just saying that it's strange that you choose to follow some parts, but not others. and when you do pick, it doesnt even follow your own beliefs."
cslhdwn,,"All this 'The Church in the UK' stuff is hilarious. You clearly know nothing about different denominations of Christianity, and nether do we all follow the bible or interpret it in the same way.No surprise that you quote Leviticus and list it as a 'sin'. But keep trying to approach faith in this, I'm sure someone as shit as you are at it will come along and you can have a nice chat.Pearls > Swine."
cslhs2e,olican101,">All this 'The Church in the UK' stuff is hilarious. You clearly know nothing about different denominations of Christianity, and nether do we all follow the bible or interpret it in the same way.Then why do you chose to interpret it in a way that says homosexuality is wrong?>No surprise that you quote Leviticus and list it as a 'sin'. But keep trying to approach faith in this, I'm sure someone as shit as you are at it will come along and you can have a nice chat.Leviticus is in the bible... you asked for a source and i gave you one... ""You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination."" is also in Leviticus. So not only are you picking and choosing in the bible, but you are picking and choosing from the same book of the bible."
csli5cx,,"> Then why do you chose to interpret it in a way that says homosexuality is wrong?Through prayer with God, he reveals the mysteries of scripture. Both the Old and New testament also blatantly say that homosexuality is against God's command and thus a sin - the Leviticus verse you reference above, and Paul's writings on men having 'sinful lusts' for other men.> Leviticus is in the bibleMan, your way of reading the Bible is *boring*.You have no regard for context. The rules of Leviticus were for the people of Israel specifically, hence Jesus' differences in commandment as he was giving rules to a different group of people. Yet, underneath the differences of commandment - the Old covenant and Jesus fulfilling it - you get continuity in God's attitude towards the sin, as he does not change (as it says in Malachi). So homosexuality is, in God's eyes, always a sin throughout the Bible.But again, these are boring, cliche arguments towards Christians and the Bible. Do a bit more research and try to at least criticise Christian views with some awareness of the subject matter. Else you're being incredibly disrespectful to those who spend their whole lives studying it, seeing as you think you can have a couple of thoughts on the matter recycled from whatever anti-bigot bigots you source them from and try to drag the conversation down to your infantile level of understanding about scripture.

If gays want to get married, go for it, but there are issues that will fuck ALL OF US that are being ignored because of the diversions created by politicians and newscasters. Our government is spending we money we don't have and are borrowing from other powerful countries, that will eventually collect, to violate the laws and rights of the citizens that they're supposed to be bound to by illegally tapping into our wires and watching everything we do, hoping to build cases against us, marking us as criminals before there is even a crime committed. Not only this, but they're also using said money to fund and send our troops to other nations that want us wiped off the map and out of history. Let's also remember that the current administration wants to violate our 2nd Amendment right to own and possess weapons to defend ourselves from all enemies foreign and domestic and pass legislation that would effectively leave the law abiding citizens helpless against the criminals that the laws are intended to stop. Our borders are wide open with minimal checks, allowing people that want to do harm to the citizens living there while we fight other nations' wars that already hate us and want every single one of us dead! Instead , everyone is talking about how a part of our history needs to be erased forever because of racism. So instead of learning that we need to work together to solve problems on a national scale and that the states are allowed to pass many laws that the federal government can't, we'll just fall into the very same pit we did 150 years ago and start another war against our brothers and sisters. We need to be united together to set things right. Right now all the politicians and media want us to be torn apart by a few social issues instead of focusing on the things that will kill us (figuratively and literally) in less than 50 years if we allow it to continue."
csjonep,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,"Ah the old ''there are more important issues'' routine. If that's your problem with the debate shouldn't you be happy about this? It's been ultimately decided now, so we can all move on to those important issues and never have to worry about this again."

American media is bought and paid for."
csjposo,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,"Confederate flag maybe, but believe it or not gay marriage isn't just a distraction, it matters MASSIVELY to a lot of people, particularly gay people. If something was passed that effected your life as much as this does theirs then you probably wouldn't say anything or find anything weird about it being on the news for the next weeks.That being said yes the media is bought and payed for apart from PBS, but does it even matter? The media isn't going to solve these issues, and to be honest neither are any of the people who get all their information and opinions from the 24 hour infotainement cycle.Nobody who is smart and capable enough to tackle any of these issues and be a part of an actual effective conversation about them is held back from doing so because it's Gay Marriage week for the commercial media."
csjpwsg,Man_of_Many_Voices,"The media plays a pivotal role in informing citizens and really shaping the public views on a lot of different things. Right now in the state it's in, it's absolutely toxic.

By talking about it over and over and over, all that does is make the kid seem like some anti-hero that should be admired. Some sick, edgy teenager is gonna go rampage now because he know he's guaranteed his fifteen minutes of fame. Our media is a fucking mess, in so many ways."

What would happen? I'm pretty sure that it won't end well. That's just the beginning."
csjs31g,YetAnother_WhiteGuy,"If they ever pull that shit for real the largest army on the planet can fuck them up easily. It's behooves these nations a lot more to keep america in debt to them instead of suddenly asking for it all back, and they know this. The amount of money they are owed is quite a bit more money then physically exists too, so they'd never get it all back anyway. Unrealistic scenario, would never happen, next please."
csjslzn,biglineman,"Getting in bed with them is bad enough. There's other ways to pay off debts than money. They could take our bases, that shouldn't be there in the first place, and imprison our soldiers that are stationed there. Then they could use the equipment there to invade other nations like Ukraine. Our allies might come to help us. That might be a different story now that they are aware that our government is spying on them as well."

csjj5pn,youdontseekyoda,I'm not saying what will happen. I'm talking about the attitude of the unwashed masses who would get behind an outright ban.
csjjd2q,Enigmaticize,"And, as it turns out, kind of similarly to same-sex marriage being legal now, it doesn't matter what the unwashed masses think if the constitution specifically says something about it. In the same-sex marriage case, the 14th amendment guaranteed equal rights, whereas an outright ban on a flag couldn't happen due to the 1st amendment.It doesn't matter if people want an outright ban, the only thing that the government can do is not allow it on government property.Plus, I would argue that both things are in the name of progress - moving away from a symbol of racism and inequality and granting equality to others."
csjhrqq,,Nobody has tried to ban the confederate flag.There's no hypocrisy here. These are completely separate issues. The first involves all citizens having equal opportunity to the same institutions. The second involves the behavior of the government. Citizens have total freedom. The government does not.
csjhy3c,,"The flag isn't banned, it's just being taken down from government buildings and from private companies. Anyone is free to campaign to change what is happening on government property, you are free to campaign to put it back up if you want. And private companies are free to ban products for any reason they want to. In this case they banned an item because of it's association with hate speech and hate groups, not because of its association with southern pride. If you don't like the company doing that, you may buy it from another company that sells because that's how a free market works. But hey, let me [snopes](http://m.snopes.com/obama-bans-confederate-flag/) that for you if you don't believe me."

There is no legal restriction on painting your Southern Just-Us Wargarbl all over everything you own. You can fly it from your flagpole. You can start making and selling them. But it is unambiguously hate speech. Maybe you didn't know that, but that's the place that particular flag comes from. And the black citizens of a state have every right to be pissed at that flying over THEIR state capital. The political professionals look at this and decided - predictably - that the LAST thing they wanted was ANYTHING that would absolutely increase black voter turnout with the goal of electing a government that will do something about it. That, and the already crippling private sanctions. Which is what you are actually bitching about. The fact that you can't say anything you like and not suffer the consequences.But in fact, you have to. You have to watch as good jobs go to other states that are not run by proud racist assholes. You want to be a proud, southern social conservative? Fine by me - honestly, I have no objection. But I won't be doing business with you. I don't care to make it *easy* for you to abuse your wife, beat your kids and deny reality. I think there should be consequences - and in my tiny way, I get to impose them.So do you - but the numbers are tilting in my favor, and I'm far less worried about a Molotov cocktail flying through my window than I once was."
csjn2cw,,"Perhaps you don't understand the nuances of the English language. A ban has nothing to do with how people feel about the flag. A ban would mean it is unlawful to display the flag. It doesn't mean that people choose not to display the flag or choose to give shit to people who do.The freedom to display the flag - a very much still intact freedom - comes with it the consequences of such a freedom. Meaning the freedom of everybody else to react however they see fit. If a person can't stand the pressure, well, that's on the person. But it doesn't mean that anything has been banned."
csjjg7d,,"Yeah, what Apple did was use an axe to remove a splinter. They made themselves look completely unreasonable by banning any and all aps using it without any analysis of what the aps were about or what they were saying. But it is there right to choose what aps they host on their store for whatever reason they choose. As for people not wanting it to be displayed, anyone has the right to speak up about what happens on government property. If I don't want something displayed by my government for any reason, not just because I think it's a symbol of hate speech, I have the right to stand up and request it's removal. Now if there was a call for there to ban private ownership of confederate flag memorabilia there would be a problem. I guess what I'm saying is that I don't find anything wrong with what the anti-confederate flag movement is doing YET. Even Apple making dumb decisions isn't wrong on a legal level that's just a company being stupid. However, I am cautiously waiting for something to go wrong and if people start talking about criminalizing private ownership of confederate flags, that's where I would draw the line."
csjl4ha,grammarnazivigilante,Ugh why does this have to be explained over and over.No one is proposing the banning of the flag. They're talking about removing it from public buildings.A ban would mean: no one can purchase or own the flag. That's just simply not the case. See: dictionary.

Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other.27 And the men, instead of having normal sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and as a result of this sin, they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved.28 Since they thought it foolish to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their foolish thinking and let them do things that should never be done.29 Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarreling, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip.30 They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They invent new ways of sinning, and they disobey their parents.31 They refuse to understand, break their promises, are heartless, and have no mercy.32 They know God's justice requires that those who do these things deserve to die, yet they do them anyway.

csjgr5f,ANAL_BREATHS,"IMO no because it creates a bubble in the area. It allows them to confirm their beliefs by living in a homogenous location.

csjha3s,Enigmaticize,"But not everywhere. Sure, eventually most states would allow same-sex marriage, but how long would it take for the 50th state? The majority shouldn't decide who gets rights and who doesn't when the constitution promises equality."
csjhl5q,,"there hasn't been for most of the time, and it'd take years for a place like Alabama to legalize it via popular vote versus new york"
csjhpi5,rocketwidget,Treating minorities equally shouldn't be up to popular vote. Tyranny of the majority and all that. These kinds of issues are explicitly why the founding fathers created a constitutional republic instead of a direct democracy.
csjhcml,Ethanol_Based_Life,They are not creating a law. They are interpreting one that was already put in place democratically.
csjhrd0,,"Essentially? Yes. The question existed as to whether or not the democratically-achieved ban on gay marriage violated the US Constitution. The SCOTUS exists to provide an answer to questions like that. In this case, they agreed: States may not abridge on the privileges of citizens unless they do it equally, as stated in the 14th Amendment. This ruling simply stated that same-sex marriage is covered in that list of privileges.*No Law* that is unconstitutional is allowed to stand, regardless of how ""democratic"" the process was to enact such a law."
csjihxq,JoeyPantz,"Yes, this was the right way to go about this. These states were restricting the rights of citizens. Sometimes a national law is the only way to get people to play fair. Its not undemocratic, the undemocratic thing is to deny people fair rights because they like to fuck people with the same parts as them. No, those states wouldn't have legalized gay marriage ever. Nobody was forcing them to. They liked it how it was, and so they had no reason to. These are the same people who think it was okay to fly the confederate flag, a flag which represents not only another country, but was primarily used in protest to civil rights, on a government building. Doing this by going over their heads was the only way. Who the fuck cares if people are saying it should be overturned? It never will be. Let those poeple scream until they turn red in the face, we'll continue ignoring their ignorance. Was that response worthy of the downvote i gave you?"
csjfr7m,jlange94,The same thing happened with Proposition 8 in California. The state democratically voted to not allow gay marriage and the court system decided against it. It's taking the word of 9 highly intelligible people instead of the vote of a country's citizens.
csjftsr,ThomasFowl,Yes but part of that overturn was that polling data now suggested that the votes would repeal Prop 8 anyway.
csjg19n,jlange94,"Just an example of what you were suggesting. Honestly I believe in democratic solutions for these situations, especially when everyone has an opinion about something. Makes them feel empowered being able to vote for what they believe in and see a real change by doing so."
csjhmod,allthebetter,"The reason that this is the best course of action in this instance is because the whole issue is revolving about equal rights (14th amendment). Even if the majority is voting to outlaw gay marriage, it becomes an equal rights issue that even gays are allowed to reap the benefits of marriage. I mean the legal marriage, not the religious one. Churches I think will still be able to refuse to marry gay couples based on their religious preference.The court ruled this way because it is a civil rights issue, similar to the right to vote for women, or the civil rights movement in the '60s"
csjhn3p,Wreckless711,"Some things shouldn't be debatable by individual states. This is one such occasion. When it comes to equality in the US, it should be nationwide. Women's rights, colored rights, rights of speech and religion are all a few that are fundamentally the same. By denying gay people and not straight people you create inequality. If you don't want gays to be able to marry legally then straights shouldn't either. Their are only two fair ways, everyone, or nobody."
csjhnx3,MKE_abroad,It is the Supreme Court's responsibility to protect minority rights from legislation which oppresses said rights. They now set precedent to avoid anymore legislation which would infringe on gay rights. This is exactly where this should have been decided. Just like it was the right place to resolve segregation and the infringement of African American rights. That is the whole purpose of Judicial Review. To prevent oppressive legislation by the majority. Good job SCOTUS!
csji2vo,,"It'd be nice to get the majority of people to realize that everyone should have equal protection under the law, sure. But if we hinged on that we'd still likely have segregated schools and 'separate but equal'. Pretty plainly, though, this boils down to SCOTUS doing what they're supposed to do: determine if laws are constitutional."
csjfcfv,throwaway57458,"> but is seems like a terrible idea when it is legalized through the courts likes thisIt is horrible that the government is involved. But since the .Gov seems insistent on being involved in shit they ought not be involved in, at least this makes everything equal.

That's just the internet and the media whipping you up into a frenzy. There are plenty of issues to still be resolved, but it's a lot easier if you address them accurately and factually instead of adding your own hyperbole and causing neutral or opposing persons to instantly dismiss your concerns. Resolving issues is much easier when you're level-headed and honest about them instead of running around like a crazy person with your pants-on-head on fire."

csk2e5i,,"Just remarking on the timing. Gay marriage is an issue that could've easily been solved years ago, if not for partisan bickering. Also odd that both sides of the aisle are cooperating on the TPP, no?And I suppose its just a coincidence that r/news doesn't allow any articles related to the TPP claiming that it is political, but somehow a supreme court ruling is not?"
csk2fzx,,No one brought it before the supreme court years ago. They can't just arbitrarily rule on things. Also international trade policy has literally nothing to do with the supreme court.
csk2x67,,"There are plenty of other government bodies that could've done something about this, it didn't have to wait for a supreme court case.

csk2yfk,,The conspiracy? No I'm not.
csk36oi,,"No the part that articles mentioning the TPP are removed from r/news for being political, but this isn't. Obviously we are being manipulated in the direction of talking about gay marriage, and not the TPP. Its not a conspiracy, its just what the mods of r/news are doing. You can attribute it to Illuminati or whatever you want, but don't put those words in my mouth. In which case, my original point (remember, the one you started to argue with me about?) still stands: don't let this distract you from the TPP!"
csk3gy2,,Well a judgement that a law violates the Constitution isnt political. An unconstitutional law has been quashed. Everyone wins. The United States is a better place today. Laypeople disagreeing with the decision of the supreme court doesn't make it political.
csk3qu0,,"You should say 'constitutional' and 'law' a few more times, that'll prove that the subject you're referring to is indeed not involved with politics in any way... top kek"

csjerog,,Waiting to see comments where people consider the growing power of an unelected judiciary. This and the Obamacare ruling show an increasingly powerful court. People aren't looking past each ruling. Celebrating each issue while the justices quietly change the system.
csjew6j,,"You know someone yesterday brought up a really fascinating point I had never really thought of before .If you are not a fan of homosexuality, ironically you need to be a fan of gay marriage. The reason for this is simple genetics. If we assume that homosexuality is a genetic mutation (all evidence points to this), then by allowing gay marriage and thus not pushing gay people into a fake heterosexual marraige, gay people will no longer be breeding. This will be the first time in history that people with the genetic mutation will not be breeding in large numbers in an attempt to seem ""normal"", and therefore it's very possible that the number of gay people will begin to decline as the genetic mutation starts to fade away."
csjfcm1,,"Well, homosexuality is in our genres and it's not a black and white thing. As long as we have Humans, we'lol have homosexuals."
csjfcn5,,"Well, homosexuality is in our genres and it's not a black and white thing. As long as we have Humans, we'll have homosexuals."
csjftpu,,"Uhhh i'm not sure you know how genetics works. Traits have to be bred. Sure the mutation will always occur in a very small number of people, but if people with the gene breed less, there will be less future generations with the gene. It's quite straight forward."
csjgfcz,,"The thing is, a straight person can give birth to a gay person. It wouldn't be as straight forward as you'd like to think, the human gene is complex, sometimes ""stap fuckin'"" just isn't the answer."
csjmxdn,,"Oh of course they can, and do all the time. But genetic traits increase and decrease in likelihood based on who is breeding. This is one reason why Redheads are going extinct, because for the most part redheads are not marrying redheads anymore, thus diminishing the chance of getting more redheads. The exact same thing will happen with homosexuality. As fewer and fewer gay people procreate, their numbers will dwindle."
csjewuh,Edjew,So it's finally legal in all the state's?

Because I believe the whole concept of marriage is religiously based upon the union of a man and woman.*However*As an American I believe that everyone has the right for equality. Even though I don't agree with some of their choices, I believe that it is very important to accept and love everyone. I believe that they should have all the exact same treatments as heterosexual couples, from tax status to adoption to health and life insurance options. They should be able to live their own lives without judgement or harassment based on their preferences. It is imperative that everyone have the freedom to live however they please (granted that they are not harming others).This is a huge step for our country, and I really am glad that millions of people are finally going to get the equality they deserve from our government and society."

It just took the highest authority basically declaring it officially.The people who tout state's rights hold the constitution as the highest authority...until the Supreme Court interprets that the constitution means something they don't like. Well, too bad, so sad. If segregation of schools or equal voting rights were still left up to the states, we'd have states kicking blacks out of schools to this day. Sometimes, particularly in cases like this where people's rights and liberties are literally being infringed upon by the state, I *absolutely* believe that the higher authority of the Supreme Court is *necessary* and *invaluable*. And obviously, the Supreme Court has limits to what they can do. That's why I suggest you take a course on US Government so you can learn how these things work....or you can continue being ignorant.

csjs79h,x6ftundx,"true, but still odd how around 5 million people dictate so much in this country of 310 million."
csjslz4,macaco_gordinho,how so? All consenting adults should have the right to marry who they choose. Why do 310 million GET to do it and 5 million DON'T
csjsqpv,x6ftundx,"Because before all this it was a Man and a Woman. Now they have to change all the forms and everything else to make it Applicant 1 and Applicant 2. More taxpayer money down the drain. The real reason behind getting this done is because now Lawyers and the Government make a ton more money. It's funny how the gays don't see that it's all a scam to get more money out of them. They make money because now it's more taxes and someone has to file Divorces, Trusts, Wills, etc. Going to love Gay Divorce Court on the TV soon."
csjst9y,macaco_gordinho,Things are as we see them until we learn to see them differnt. The real reason to getting this done was equal rights.
csjt68z,x6ftundx,"ha ha really? Equal rights???? Give me a break, if you think that then you shouldn't respond anymore. Money and power is the only real reason this was done. It's election season and now all the candidates have a new base to love or hate and also new talking points. Lawyers get more money. Big Government is happy because now it can start giving out welfare, obama care, social security, and other freebies that the poor and middle class has to pay for by more taxes. The rich just get richer. This has absolutely NOTHING to do with equal rights. Do you honestly think this would have passed if it wasn't a free for all in 2016? Pull off the shades and open your eyes. PR is PR and Money is Money...Wait until all the unintended consequences that we haven't even thought about hit. Then it's all gonna be a blame game. Look at how everyone was happy about Obama care in the beginning and it's turned into a giant boondoggle that we will never get out of. It's another social security fiasco all over again. Young people paying for old people when the young people will never see it."
csjta01,macaco_gordinho,what are the unintended consequences of making same sex marriage legal?
csjtjxv,x6ftundx,"SCOUTS just said that Federal Rights trump States Rights and have set the president. The Federal Government now has a president that states things like concealed permits, open carry, insurance, gas taxes, income taxes, etc. can all be done Federally instead of by the states. My concealed permit could now be allowed in all 50 states instead of the 26 if the Federal government says. Pot can be mandated to be allowed in all 50 states. The legal age to drink could be made 25. Everyone leaving high school has to join the armed forces for two years before going to college. All of these could be done and more by this one decision. Welcome to new chaos or Unintended Consequences."
csjtukd,macaco_gordinho,"Yeah no. This did not set a ""precendent"" by allowing same sex marriage. Our legal system works like this: State makes law, people feel law is unconstitutional, law gets challenged, can be appealled all the way to SCOTUS, they rule law is unconstitutional, law gets revoked. Roe v Wade, Plessy v Ferguson, Brown v Board of Ed. Topeka Kansas. All social issues, all at one point seen as horrible ideas that would ruin the world we know.So Yeah...No."

csjo55c,NineteenEighty9,I've never seen so many gilded comments before!!
csjpg69,WOX_69,"While this is a landmark decision, I have a question for anyone willing to answer. What's the next step in this process? States can't ban gay marriage, and now are obligated to honor gay marriages from other states. So what's the next step?Since gay marriage cannot be banned by the state anymore, does that mean it's still within a state's power to decide if they will ""perform"" gay marriages? Like could Texas say they're not going to perform them, IE, some sort of backdoor ban without full on denying it?What about municipal laws? Do cities have the power to ban/no acknowledge gay marriages?-EDIT-Why would someone downvote this?"
csjqj5h,,"They could try, and then lower courts would bitch slap the state and force them to comply. No, the supreme court is, well, supreme, and every single governmental entity has no choice but to acknowledge gay marriage or they are breaking the law."
csjr1jp,WOX_69,I was curious if it was one of those cases where the Supreme Court ruled on whether or not the state had the right to do so or if it was purely unconstitutional and thus must be adhered to by all. Glad it's the latter.
csjq02a,eliminate1337,"There is no back door this time. Local courts and district judges can faff about and possibly delay granting marriage licenses for maybe two weeks of they're dedicated but most won't bother because it's futile. They will be forced to comply whether they like it or not. Technically what the Supreme Court did is ban the banning of gay marriage. All current and future laws against it are invalid. States, cities, and counties can't do anything. Nobody has the power to ban it anymore."
csjqazv,WOX_69,I see. How does this work with religious institutions with the power to grant marriage?
csjqnuf,eliminate1337,"Churches won't be forced to marry anyone if it's against their beliefs. A marriage needs to be witnessed by an officiant, who is usually but not always a priest. Same-sex couples wanting to get married must find either a priest or a secular officiant to preside over their ceremony."
csjq9q6,SkullLeader,"I'm sure the right wing will now try and get creative to look at ways to ban it without technically banning it. Practically speaking, it means that if you show up to apply for a marriage license, they can no longer refuse to grant you one for the reason that your prospective spouse is of the same sex as you. Since having a government official (judge, justice of the peace, etc.) perform the ceremony is but one way to actually get married, and there are many other (non-government) people you can go have a ceremony once you have the license, you can get the license and then get married, end of story.One idea I've heard being floated around is that the conservatives will try, state-by-state, to change the laws so that only religious institutions can actually perform the ceremonies, and since (many) religions would not marry a gay couple, they would use this to effectively ban or at least greatly hinder the ability of gay couples to get married."
csjucth,WOX_69,"A ceremony being completely ancillary to the marriage process, just the celebration of the union in this regard, correct?That totally seems like something will fall flat on its face if anyone truly tries to propose that idea. That's just doing to much for something so stupid."
csjw3im,SkullLeader,"Well, at least when I got married (about two years ago, in California) being issued the marriage license did not mean you were married. After you got the license (which was only valid for I think 90 days), a certified wedding officiant had to perform the ceremony, and they had to sign a certificate that came with the marriage license. A couple of witnesses to the ceremony had to sign as well. If that didn't happen within 90 days, the license expired. After that, the officiant mailed the license back to the county administration where we live and then a few weeks later in the mail we received our marriage certificate. So merely getting the marriage license wasn't enough, the ceremony had to happen and was more than a mere formality since without the ceremony, we'd not have officially been considered to be married."
csk3wss,WOX_69,"Interesting, never knew that in general. I'm also from California."
csjqv6a,figurativelyliteral8,"just saw this, might be helpful:http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3b72py/eli5_what_does_the_supreme_court_ruling_on_gay/i like the ELI5 page."
csjqw0m,le_pep,"If Texas were to say they weren't going to honor the ruling or try to invent loopholes, the Federal government would withhold a lot of funding for roads and schools and shit. It's unlikely this would lead to the national guard being sent to force courthouses or whatever to comply since the Fed has enough control over finances to twist the states arm anyways. The ruling just compels the Fed to twist the arms.Also, Texas isn't really the state you have to worry about most. Austin is hugely democratic and, it being the capitol, will set the tone of the media to a positive one and people will mostly be placated as a result. It's other heavily conservative states that might cause trouble."

There appears to still be a belief in majority rule, which as we all know is a dangerous thing. I wonder if she would feel the same way if the majority wanted to discriminate against blacks for jobs or... any other thing the civil rights movement was about.One thing I will say... it took 5 judges only a few months to do what Congress hasn't been able to do for 200 years.

csk91ht,MG87,"No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right."" -- Justice Kennedy"

csjgstm,leDesespoir,"No, I'm saying we all need to shut the fuck up now about this whole issue because there's no basis to continue talking about it. We're all officially equal."
csjjel3,,So are you in the camp that we should stop talking about racism because technically we're equal? Racism is still and issue and homophobia will still be an issue.

csjoqzz,MrWakey,"I think you (and a lot of other people) are looking at it backwards. It's not that the court moved gay pairs from the ""can't get married"" pile into the ""can get married"" pile. It's that they said the 14th Amendment means you can't force them to stay in the ""can't get married"" pile just because they're same-sex. The effect is the same, of course, but the logic is different, and that's why the reasoning doesn't apply to incest. One could certainly argue that the 14th Amendment means you can't keep brothers and sisters in the ""can't get married"" pile either, but (a) nobody's making that argument, and (b) you can probably demonstrate a compelling state interest in prohibiting incestuous marriages."
csjor04,,"Not to mention the fact that your genomes would be incredibly similar, leading to horrendously high chances of your offspring having a birth defect. Your sister's body would be like ""Wtf?"" when her egg is fertilized because the 46 chromosomes will be so similar. Worst case scenario is that her body reads these as copies and deletes some accidentally.I don't mean to sound harsh, just wanted to chime in :D"
csjorfn,MarshmeloAnthony,This isn't a thing. The vast majority of cases of incest are in the form of sexual abuse against a child by an adult.
csjoukr,macaco_gordinho,"The problem with incest isn't really about two consenting adults who are related wanting to get married. Ususally incest is formed when adults and children have a relationship, which is more considered a form of child abuse. Not to mention all the of the birth defects one can have with an incestual child (See Charles II of Spain or Joffrey from GoT)"
csjp45q,rainman_104,"> why is incest marriage not legalized?Because of biology. The probability of having weird genetic fuckups happen from babies of incest is atrocious.That, and incest doesn't usually involve two consenting adults. It involves systematic abuses much like women who join polygamist cults."
csjugnv,Spokker,"It is interesting see not just that advocates of gay marriage won, but won so solidly. This is like a 15-1 game of baseball. It's a rout. It takes ""BTFO"" to a whole new level.Not only have advocates of gay marriage won, they have salted the Earth for anyone who is against gay marriage. You cannot work at Google, for example, and voice anti-gay marriage beliefs. They said they are proud to celebrate this decision on their front page. Even if they did not outright fire you, you would probably be isolated in the long run. You cannot work at most jobs worth a damn and voice anti-gay marriage beliefs, in my estimation. Co-founders of companies have been ruined for voicing anti-gay marriage beliefs. If you posted anything close to what Scalia, a Supreme Court Justice, wrote on your personal Facebook page under your real name, there's a good chance your career would be over. Hell, I think that you would even be fired from a gas station attendant job if someone made a big stink about it.So whether you agree or disagree with this decision, you've got to hand it to how utterly in control advocates of gay marriage are and how they decimated the opposition. Anyone who is an advocate of anything should learn from them. They made being against what they believe detrimental to your personal well-being. Incredible achievement, in my opinion."
csjutxt,,won solidly?wasn't the SC ruling 5-4?
csjviqa,eliminate1337,"The score of the decision is irrelevant, the result is the same. Unlike state laws allowing same sex marriage, this result in final. There's no going back now. Barring some very unorthodox legal footwork, same sex marriage will be legal in the US for the foreseeable future."
csjvsg6,,"do you realize what you are calling a solid win could have been completely different had 1 of those 5 judges thought differently?a margin of 1 is not a solid anythingi'm glad the govt is out of the business of telling 2 adults who they can marry since i don't think it was any of the Fed's concern in the first place.but its legal because of 1 person. 1. singular.and yeah, just wait - you're gonna see that unorthodox legal footwork.the US govt has used this to distract the US voter. its worked really really really well because its emotional and easy to understand. if you think career politicians are going to give that up, and possibly have what they are really doing come under scrutiny … well, i hope your naiveté doesn't hurt you"
csjwlt5,eliminate1337,"5-4 if is the second most common ruling in the Supreme Court. The Court has never backtracked on a progressive issue like this. Even the Republican presidential candidates were hesitant to dismiss this ruling. A few of them said they would accept the decision even if they didn't personally agree. Only the craziest of the religious conservatives (Jindal) said he wouldn't abide. I don't know who you think is going to try to reverse this ruling. You mentioned career politicians. Do you think they give half a shit about same sex marriage? Of course not, they care about what will put them into power. Same sex marriage is gaining political favor in the United States. [61% of young Republicans support gay marriage.]( http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/10/61-of-young-republicans-favor-same-sex-marriage/) The tide is turning, and career politicians will turn with it if it gets them favor with the voters."
csjwqa3,,"no. i don't think career politicians care about marriage at all.they DO care about issues that the party extremists can rally around.since the Republican party has displayed a pretty united front, i can only assume that most of their extremists are terribly opposed"
csjvuv2,Spokker,I meant in the court of public opinion.
csjw9al,,ah. my bad
csjyeak,knight-of-lambda,"I'm in complete support of gay rights (equal participation in all public institutions), and have been since I became aware of the issue many years ago. Just wanted to state that in case anyone thinks otherwise after reading the rest of this post.That being said, I think you've made a salient observation, but not a novel one. Such social movements have occurred across history. One faction would gain an overwhelming moral advantage over the opposition, marginalizing their views in the public arena with deft political footwork.But the idea itself has to be infectious. It has to be relatable and palatable. Once enough people vouch that idea, people on the fence can't be on the fence anymore, lest they be excluded from the growing community of *agreers*. So the neutral ones begin agreeing too. In this case, gay rights started on the left end of the political spectrum and spread right, outcompeting competing ideas.Not that it's always a bad thing. An old idea got outcompeted by a new one, just one way species die off; it happens in nature all the time. The ""sanctity of marriage between man and woman"" was a meme that simply cannot survive in this century. There are plenty of older, extinct ideas that would be *extremely* impolite to express in this era. I'm sure you could easily think of a couple."
csjz516,Spokker,"Bottom line? Gun to my head, I would say I ultimately agree with the ruling. But like some I was disappointed in the way it happened."
csjvcb1,NandoVilches,"There is a very important question that I think we must consider and I would like to know about your (or anyone's) opinion on the matter. You used Google as an example as a place where voicing anti-gay marriage can cost you your employment; and I imagine that there will be several other places that will institute similar ramifications in the coming days. While I understand why these ramifications have to take place, one has to discuss on the potentiality of abuse of 'power' (lack of a better word).For example, would a person who has clear and defined religion and practiced it, everyday; and this religion does not allow same-sex marriage within the confines of its beliefs - would that person be discriminated against for being part of a group that is ""against"" the new modern ideology, or will he/she be allowed to maintain a philosophy that some will consider old and square? And will posting and voicing his beliefs (while not offending or harassing someone intentionally) be grounds for termination?The reason I ask is because I believe in a true separation of church and state; but I also believe in respecting other people's ideologies (regardless of my opinion of them)."
csjvu5l,Spokker,"I'm not going to have a good answer for you because out of all of the protected classes, I don't believe religion should be one of them because it's a choice. So again, not a good answer, but that's my answer."
csjx0gy,NandoVilches,"The First Amendment secures the free exercise of religion, section one of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits discrimination, including on the basis of religion, by securing ""the equal protection of the laws"" for every personFrom what I understand - freedom of expressing religion is protected. It's a choice yes, but a protected one."
csjx6tt,Spokker,"The first amendment is irrelevant here. Getting fired by a private employer for your religious views is no more protected than anything you say on Twitter. What is relevant here is the 14th amendment, and yes, I would disagree with religion being protected in this way. A private employer should be able to fire you for your religious views just as they are allowed to fire you for your political views. That being said, religious convictions do not save people who are asked to resign for opposing gay marriage. The outrage is just the same and few people think that should be protected.Government agencies should not be able to fire you for your religious views, however."
csjxq46,NandoVilches,So discrimination based on religious and/or political views is allowed in the US? As long as you are a in the private sector and not public.
csjxuod,Spokker,"It's allowed and not allowed. Sort of.If you say you are Christian, Muslim, whatever, you cannot be fired by any employer, public or private. Your headscarf or the sabbath must be accommodated.But if you say you are against gay marriage or maybe your views of abortion don't line up with your employer's, they *can* fire you for any reason. Like this guy: http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ousted-atlanta-fire-chief-sues-city-violating-religious-freedom-protectionsThis is recent so the case must still be going through. Last update was February 2015. I think the issue is going to be whether it was improper for him to voice his opinions at work while on the job."
csjeimt,sergeyuf,I wish the government could get out of business of defining marriage altogether.
csjf4dr,whirlpool138,Leave that to specific religious leaders and groups right?
csjg02u,sergeyuf,To individuals
csjg3u2,whirlpool138,"But isn't the US constitution's whole purpose to defend minority groups and the disadvantaged? What do you mean by individuals? I define marriage as being a legal contract between two consenting people that predates Christianity or any modern monotheistic religion. I mean, marriage already has a pretty clear definition to most people."

And now that it's ""cool"" and ""hip"" to be gay the government legalizing it is just gonna encourage kids to acting out and being gay for a time themselves. I saw it in highschool.

csjflog,DoFunStuff,"Do your thing, man, but...""This is how I Fuck"" does not a culture make."
csjfneb,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_culture
csjfwod,jlange94,What's the point of celebrating something that is equal now in all definition? I don't see it lasting for awhile same as the marches. If gay marriage is legal then the LGBT community will just fall in with the straight culture being seen as normal and won't feel like they need to make a big deal about themselves.
csjjoxi,whoremongering,">equal now in all definition?I don't think this is the case--there are still many LGBT rights issues to be decided, including legal discrimination in workplaces and housing, adoption rights, and many hot-button issues surrounding transgendered individuals.Pride parades serve several purposes. They encourage people not to be ashamed of what they are--shame and discrimination are certainly still very prevalent in many parts of the country and world. Pride is also about a (tasteful) celebration of sexuality in a society with a history of repression. Pride is also a large, fun, profitable celebration. I don't see them going away anytime soon."

csk12gl,SaraTheWeird,"Not my words, sharing this from facebook but thought it was necessary to put it here:Let's get a few things straight:1. Violence against queer and trans communities of color is steadily increasing. The majority of this violence is comes from the very state that allegedly supports our ""equality"" at the hands of the police, prisons, mental health institutions, and ICE. ""Victories"" like this Supreme Court ruling are often used to pinkwash the US government and make it seem ""LGBT friendly"" even though it's one of the biggest arbiters of anti-queer and anti-trans violence at home and abroad.2. Every time there is a symbolic ruling like this there is a significant backlash. This backlash looks like acts of physical and sexual violence against largely low-income gender non-conforming people of color who cannot afford privacy and safety. Policy change does not translate into changing hearts and minds. Community organizing does. Stop discussing progress without understanding punishment.3. What you call a ""rainbow,"" we call the racial wealth divide. It's much easier to affirm ""gay love,"" then it is to call for reparations for colonialism, slavery, and exploitation of labor. As gay marriage gets legalized the majority of LGBT donors are pulling back their funds to support queer and trans work. This leaves those of us doing racial and economic justice work even more broke and less able to get people out of prisons and into stable housing and jobs. But who needs money for bread when you can eat wedding cake?4. Marriage equality"" is an oxymoron. The institution of marriage is an inherently unequal institution. Marriage is a racist and patriarchal system established to allocate basic rights to couples over other forms of relationships. The institution of marriage has and continues to exacerbate the (racial) wealth divide in this country.5. We aren't fighting for more rights, we are fighting for abolition. This is a very different political strategy. We don't want more freedoms, we want to be free from violence. We aren't fighting for equality and love, we were fighting for economic justice and liberation. We aren't fighting for representation, we are fighting for revolution.Back to the streets."

csjwdtf,Lucid4321,"Serious question: How far does this logic extend? Say I'm a bisexual male and I feel my love can't be fully expressed by marrying only one person. Why can't I marry a man and a woman at the same time? We all love each other. No one has the right to deny our right to marry who we want, right? Just take any argument in favor of gay marriage and apply it to bisexual marriage."
csjx04g,BlindLemonLars,"I suggest you be a trailblazer in advancing this particular cause, if you truly feel it's important to you."
csjx54i,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,That's not what bisexuality is. But nice try.
csjyfgk,Lucid4321,"Who are you to define what bisexuality is? I'm not saying all bisexuals want to marry two people, but what if some of them do? You don't speak for all bisexuals. If someone identifies as bisexual, and loves a man and a woman, why can't they marry both?"
csjyhvf,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"Who am I? Well, to start off with I'm bisexual and an anthropologist, so I have personal experience and I study people... I think that's a pretty good leg to stand on, to be honest with you.Bisexuality means being attracted to men and women (or males and females, depending on how you want to define it). If they want to be in a relationship with more than one person at a time, they're polyamorous- which can coexist with bisexuality, but is completely coincidental. Being in a polyamorous relationship isn't relevant to bisexuality any more than being in an interracial relationship is."
cskd1w2,Lucid4321,"Okay, if I was attracted to a man and a woman, and wanted to marry both, then I would be both. I may not have had the terms correct, but my question is still the same. Why can't someone marry a man and a woman at the same time if that's how they feel their love will be fully expressed?As an anthropologist, have you studied homosexuality, bisexuality and/or polyamorous relationships in other cultures throughout history? What do you think is the next step for a culture after it embraces homosexuality? I think the LGBTQ community is too big and has too much momentum to just stop pushing for more progress, but what does that progress look like at this point? What do you think is the next goal they'll try to progress toward?"
csleadk,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"Sorry for the slow reply.That's actually a pretty cool question. The easy answer, unfortunately, is that human cultures are just too different to compare due to the ethical, religious, and social contexts. However, I would not expect to see polyamorous rights to be a major issue in the next decade- I can't think of a single place that legalized gay marriage and then started a domino chain of legalization.I think that the next big push for the LGBTQ community will be for our relationships with children. Right now, adoption, teaching jobs, and child activity leadership positions are largely reserved to straight people. There's this lingering belief, even among people who are otherwise fairly cool with us, that we're somehow contagious/pedophiles/scarring to children and shouldn't be allowed too close. My other bets, though not first choice, are on trans* rights and taking on anti-gay camps, psychologists, and other harmful/hateful ""cure"" programs. I won't rule out polyamory, but it's not something I've ever heard discussed among us and allies, so I would be surprised."
csm34e8,Lucid4321,"What do you mean by ""taking on anti-gay camps""? Many churches don't believe homosexual relationships are healthy, but they're not advocating for any laws or legislation that would deny homosexual rights. Would you consider them ""anti-gay camps"" you need to take on?My city had a proposition related to this on a voting cycle a few years ago. I watch a debate on local news and one segment has really stuck with me. The pro-tradition guy mentioned a story about a relationship counselor who got sued and fired because he wouldn't/couldn't counsel a gay or lesbian couple and tried to refer them to another counselor. The pro-gay guy in the debate admitted the counselor did the right thing by trying to refer them to another counselor. He had no experience counseling same sex couples, so it wouldn't have made sense for him to pretend like he did. The pro-gay guy said the problem was that the counselor mentioned he believed same sex relationships aren't healthy. So the counselor did the right thing, but got sued and fired because of his beliefs. Does that sound right? How can we have freedom of speech and religion if we can't openly talk about our beliefs?"
csjwjoo,lolamp33,"thats a damn good questionI really dont know if the books would be crossed, or that would cause a contradition (like when a man tries to marry another wife, while in an extant marriage)I say go for it! - the supreme court will have to figure this out too, the supreme court has the power to do anything now (if you havent heard)"

If I can't start a religion that has tenants denouncing black, Hispanic and Asian people, then refuse those people service based on that fact. You can't do that to gay people. Religious freedom is not freedom to discriminate. Those people made their choices and are suffering the social consequences for it. It's nobody's fault but their own. Just like I can't say ""I hate all jews"" and try to refuse service to them and not expect to be ostracized for it.And as much as I find your religion to be morally repugnant, I shouldn't be able to refuse service to you based on the fact that you're a Christian."

What is immature about these words you've arbitraily deemed to be ""bad, curses, swears?"" All you've done is added some special power to a word, for no reason. It's absurd.

csjgytj,southern_boy,"> businesses that have been sued because they do not support gay marriage and refuse service based on their religious beliefs?Well... yeah. If you provide a service you must provide it to everyone. No ""NO IRISH"" or ""NO LUTHERANS"" signs allowed. If a business simply doesn't offer a service to *any*one that's perfectly fine. ""Sorry, we don't sell Pentagram widgets."" is A-OK. When you operate in the public square you cannot sell a thing to one person and then turn right around and say ""We will not sell to *you* because of X trait."" Does that help clarify?"
csjg74b,ResplendentOwl,"Just my two cents. I'm not a Christian. Not a Conservative, but definitely a white male. I've been having discussions recently about race and find it hard to move from a similar position. That is; ""I'm not a racist. I treat everyone with respect and decency and I am a shining beacon of awesomeness is a small town of very conservative assholes"" My train of thought being, what more am I expected to do?As I engage in this discussion though it becomes pretty clear, being indifferent isn't making the problem worse, but it isn't making it better either. White male's like us do have a lot of inherent privilege in society. I benefit from a lot of scenarios and biased moments, where a person assumes different things when they see me vs a woman, or an african american, or any number of other categories. LGBT is definitely one of those categories. Those friends want you at the pride to support them not to corrupt your kids in this most horrendous of fashions, but to help push back against the everyday biases your head in the sand attitude doesn't acknowledge are happening to them. And sheltering your kids from it doesn't help them either, kids are smart, they see all of these interactions anyway within their social circle, and within the news, and how your are indifferent. You need to get involved and be talking about the injustices that your immediate crew face, just for being different. That is if you truly are empathetic to their plight.I guess my conclusion has moved to, You can't change a nation, but assuming someone else is working on it is no good. Call people on their homophobe and racist moments, be at least, a talkative advocate for your immediate crew, even though it's easier to be silent and 'not be against them'. Acknowledge their problems. Not just in your head but openly in society, it helps."
csjiejh,suarkattack,"Pride parties are full of sexual content that I wouldn't let my children watch on television or hear on the radio, so why would I bring them to an event so they can see it live?

Gay or straight, this sort of imagery is not suitable for children, especially at their ages."

csjkfuq,baldurs_turnstile,"You seem pretty defensive about it, but honestly no one's taking away your right to profess your opinions loudly and respectfully. This is America, after all. However, your defensiveness seems very familiar. It's the defensiveness people pick up when the world has shifted under their feet, and when what they used to believe suddenly becomes antiquated. Suddenly your beliefs are challenged, and you take this perfectly reasonable challenge as 'How dare they disrespect my values!' You feel that all of a sudden you must conform to a new world or be cast out. In fact for most of your life the world has conformed to *your* values, and you had the privilege of being at the center of it all. Now, you are welcome to the discourse.If your friends are pressuring you to go to Pride, then they aren't good friends. Every reasonable person supports your right to not expose your kids to things you don't want them to see.But don't paint us all with a broad brush based on your experience with a few assholes. After all, you know how it feels when the rest of America does that to Christians."

They're to busy supporting the causes that persecute Christians and Jews alike. I am not totally shocked by this, of course. But that's a different story for another time.That being said, how are we becoming a greater nation by this? I'm not talking about if homosexuality is right or wrong, I'm talking about one group losing it's constitutional freedoms so that another can gain freedoms. Many people will say that this is simply not the case, but that is exactly what we see happening already. You can see it in the news almost everyday. This isn't a move in the right direction, it's just a move into a different direction. Someone must always suffer I guess."

Obviously, we fall very, very, very short of that goal, but never the less, that should be our goal.This is actually one of the biggest problems my fellow ""Christians"" have, and I added quotations because I use the label very loosely for them. Many Christians do the exact opposite of what Jesus would have wanted and instead act like the Pharisees that persecuted Him.I am not that. I will not reject people who come to me for friendship, as long as their choices do not impede me in choices in life. I try to live as Godly as I can in hopes that they see God through me. I don't preach to them. I don't criticize them. So I can have gay friends and love them with all my heart, yet disagree with them wholeheartedly.This is a common problem with people whom I differ from, you be one of these people. They are unable to love that which is different for them, specifically Christians, Conservatives, Etc. They view us as intolerant, yet they are so intolerant towards us."

I have a tremendous respect for the concept of Christian love, and I believe Jesus was a person we should all aspire to be even just a little bit like.

csjgl4e,RawhlTahhyde,So when will polygamy be legal?
csjh8tc,eliminate1337,Read the Court's opinion. The legal argument they used could not be used to legalize polygamy.
csjgvw9,hdhale,"Good question. No, really it is."
csjh8a0,VaATC,Why the hell can't we just take marriage off the legal civil union certificate. Marriage is religious term that has no place on a legal certificate. Churches can then issue their own religious certificate when they chose to marry a couple. It is that simple. This way would not *undermine* any religious institution's belief system while granting same sex couples the legal rights of a civil union.
csjhcca,,"If the states don't regulate marriages, how are people going to enforce their marriages when they need to visit their spouses in the hospital, or enforce their rights when a spouse dies, or get health insurance under a spouse's plan?"
csjoo0l,VaATC,"The civil union certificate would take the place of the marriage certificate for all legally binding issues. As I said, take the word marriage out off any State recognized piece of paper that makes a couples union legal. Marriage is a religious term that does not need to be on/in any legal paperwork.Edit: Then churches can have their religious paperwork that their church recognizes. Therefore churches can have the power to marry whomever they wish and not marry whomever they wish, thus preserving the sanctity of their belief system. This would then allow couples of all types to gain access to the legal rights married couple have now without dissolving a churches belief system."
csk731p,,"That is a fair point. In terms of defending the status quo, I would say that religious institutions are totally free to create whatever certificates they want and need to enforce their religion's laws, and they do this all the time. (e.g. Bar mitzvahs, baptisms, etc.) I would argue that what you're asking for is a small procedural change: to call a ""government-sanctioning-of-a-life-couple"" something different. Maybe, that's not worth the cost of educating everyone about the change in terminology.Practically speaking, the government has certain rules for pairs of people who agree to commit their lives to each other, and it is important to make sure that it does not matter, for governmental purposes, with which gender each individual of that couple identifies.e: punctuation"
csk885g,VaATC,"You speak of the cost of educating people of about the change of terminology. Marriage was never spoken of in my schooling and I was raised in the conservative south. It was only spoken of in my church. I can not speak for everyone, but if the change I speak of was made people would only know the difference if they were taught in church about marriage and then went to the court house to sign the papers and saw civil union instead of marriage on the paperwork."

csjj9fy,,"Yes, in fact, the point of the Judicial system is to make rulings through interpretation of the corpus of American law, including the Constitution.

According to what you said, that paper has no meaning until read (even though what's inscribed on the paper is inherent and the only way to misinterpret such straight-forward language is to not know how to read English.), and someone could read it and conclude that the recipe also requires motor oil and that the recipe is an ""evolving document"" that may require other items in the future without having to write down those ingredients explicitly."

csjz2gb,sitheadmcgee,One more step on the road to polygamy! Getting my harem all lined up.
csjgdd1,imfineny,"So what you will about marriage being set to 2 people, comprising of opposites sexes - there is a rationale basis for it. That is how humans primarily have chosen to procreate when they do so under legal or religious authority since the dawn of history. Marriage between 2 men or 2 women has no rationale basis. Under this ruling there is no justification for not allowing bigamy, polygamy, marriage with animals, group or line marriage, etc. All must be allowed because rationale basis has be vacated. If you allow hetereo marriage, you must also include every other type of marriage, even to yourself. to any objection of this, why not? There's no more basis to object to group marriage than to homosexual marriage. Why shouldn't a man be able to take on a 2nd or 7th wife if so choses if his right to marry is not inherently limited to some rationale basis?"
csjgmtu,loki8481,"the procreation argument holds no water as states do not currently issue fertility tests before marriage licenses.animals can't consent to marriage, so that's out.I have no issue with polygamy. I can see it being legalized if polygamists ever organize a challenge before the courts like gays have done over the past couple decades."
csjhgco,imfineny,"Why should the state execute fertility tests for marriage just to not have to create gay marriage? What purpose does that serve? ""If you don't allow every type of marriage you can't have any type of marriage"", Is that your logic? How about instead of telling us about why its unfair for gays not to be able to marry for tax credits while heteros who are marrying to raise a family, why not make the case for gay marriage, and what you are trying to accomplish? We don't have polygamous marriage because of what it does to society. A bunch of young angry men with no access to women."
csjhn1y,loki8481,"the point is that, if the primary purpose of marriage is to encourage making babies, the courts should deny marriage licenses to anyone who's unable or unwilling to procreate.(fortunately, that's not the point of marriage, so they don't)"
csjn6g0,imfineny,"I don't think that the point of marriage is to encourage people to make babies, it is to create a legal institution to manage the relationship in which babies are typically made. Whether they make babies, when they do or if they do is up to them. Marriage is simply a result of a need to manage these relationships because of the prevalence of children. When people refuse to marry, the government almost always creates forms of marriage to regulate the relationship. Has the government ever felt the need to regulate the creation, dissolution (other than to just ban) gay relationships? No. No such impetus exists for ""gay marriage"" because gay couples almost never breed or get married in the first place. Homosexuality & bisexuality despite popular belief is pretty rare, < 2% and also transient. Fully half of those that find themselves gay some point of their life will end up heterosexual and with children. So there is no need to create a legal framework for it, which is what marriage is for."
csjh95u,,[deleted]
csjhq1k,imfineny,There doesn't have to be wide spread support when the court says its a right. This isn't a political policy its a legal framework that devolves marriage into a series of tax breaks and legal benefits instead of a legal covenant people can use to raise the next generation.
csjixoe,,[deleted]
csjo17f,imfineny,">You're still saying that marriage is strictly for the purpose of procreatingI never said that. I said marriage is regulate the relationship in which children are produced. Saying that marriage should be an institution created without the context of whats obviously an important biological fact is ridiculous. The state creates the laws governing marriage because it has too. It needs a way to create customs to deal with divorce, death, custody, contracts, inheritance, etc, etc, etc. No need exists with gay marriage because in the eyes of the government is that they are (quite rightly) nothing more than close friends that don't need the legal framework since they can just file a few simple documents to take care of their needs. And its 100% okay to be gay and live together till you both pass away. But why you need to go around pretending to want to be like ""breeders"" and a house with white picket fence, is beyond me. >What our law (and through that, Supreme Court) does is very fluid and changing.Well that's really a problem. If the law can just mean whatever you want it to say, than there isn't law and we don't have any rights. They become customary grants that are always just one case away from being taken away or abridged. It takes away power from the people and gives it over to the whims of whatever 5 justices happen to feel like on the bench. Justices that can be threatened, blackmailed, extorted, tortured, bribed into doing the bidding of whoever is vile enough to do so. What you have outlined is abhorrent. If there is support for it, let them pass the laws and make it so. If not, that the legal chicanery should end before you get in someone that will use your own tactics against you"

csjpi7c,imfineny,">I'm done with this. You are so ignorant, it's not even worth my time. You clearly don't know anything about how our legal systems works or about general human nature.I get it, you want to enforce your beliefs for whatever reason on a whole country without having to actually convince anyone on the merits of what you want. So instead of using, you know the amendment process as outlined in Article 5, you decide to just make something up arbitrarily and called it unconstitutional. Great so what if a president on the right decides to do what what FDR did and terrorize the court into doing his bidding? The old saying ""A switch in time that saved 9"" was a real thing. You also had Hoover in charge of the FBI that felt that he could go around and terrorize even presidents and presumably if he felt the need Justices into doing his bidding, which could have very well occurred.What are you going to say when your own tactics are used against you and the living document turns into the monster you made it into and comes after you?"
csjhdep,eliminate1337,"The legal language is very clear here. Laws say that only a man and a woman can get married. According to the Constitution, men and women are equal in the law. Thus, the laws regarding marriage must apply to both parties regardless of gender.There is no precedent for anything else in your post. There is no law legalizing polygamy and there's no framework to challenge that marriage exists between two people. Expanding to more than two could not be argued under the constitution and would have to be a new law subject to the usual process."
csjhluh,imfineny,They just created the legal framework for it by removing rationale basis for marriage. Without a rationale basis there can be no basis for an objection. Under this decision how is marriage between 4 people any less objectionable than 2? Why can't a man marry 2 women separately? there can be none.
csjhum5,eliminate1337,"> Why can't a man marry 2 women separately?Because that isn't the law. All that today's ruling did was make an existing law apply to straight and gay people equally, as the constitution says. It only invalidates existing bans. For a man to marry two women, a new law must be passed. The Supreme Court can't do that."
csjo6c0,imfineny,"Well if we are all legal under the law, how can 1 woman have the right to marry a man and not the other? If someone else has the right to marry that woman and we are all equal under the law and free, why cannot that man? Whats the point in your bigotry against multi party marriage? The only thing the ruling did was to invite fantasy in place of direct knowledge of biology and the law. By moving to an irrational basis for marriage they have no broken the firewall of regulation based on reality for whatever the next justice says. On the basis of this decision there is no more basis for any such regulation. Of course they don't want to say it, but its true nonetheless."

csjhemv,hdhale,"I said quite some time ago that I respected the stand that social conservatives have taken with regard to wanting to protect the institution of marriage. However, they found themselves in the wrong in that they were unable to separate the civil contract and civil institution that is marriage from the religious sacrament that is marriage. Those are ultimately two separate things.Social conservatives are not wrong about what the Bible says about the matter, and people who waffle and hand wave in an attempt to make Jesus into a supporter of homosexual rights are fooling themselves and misinforming others. Jesus welcomed all into the faith. Jesus wanted Christians to seek out those who needed God most. But with that came the basic understanding that while people who sin should be welcomed with open arms, they should also turn away from their sin and have a fresh start, not continue in it as something that ""Jesus didn't address"".I support the decision of the Supreme Court. However, I have some major concerns. I worry that the 14th amendment has been turned into a ""catch all"" for social activists that it was never intended to be. I worry that people will take this ruling and use it like a warhammer to go around and attempt to smash social conservatives simply for being social conservatives, not in defense of any rights per se. Time will tell if we have turned some sort of corner here and with the issue settled, life in America just got simpler. I hope so, though I doubt it."

THAT is the correct solution to the gay marriage issue. Though I am truly truly pleased you can now marry the one you love, the missed opportunity will always be a sore point for me. We could have completely removed marriage from the purview of govt, but instead, because of this instant-gratification world we live in, a very small group of people have put themselves into greater bondage by agreeing that govt can even tell them who they can or can not marry in the first place. Don't you remember, that the ends does not justify the means?Keeping all of us in bondage to Govt when you could have been the force to set us all free, was a selfish move. Celebrate for sure, but if you had waited and forced the govt to remove their hands from marriage, period, the celebration would have been a LOT bigger, and the people would have been a lot free'er.

csjm0zw,-ParticleMan-,>So this is one big liberal circle jerk.sprinkled with a bunch of butthurt conservatives throwing tantrums
csjfazn,immanuel79,"A sad day for America, when the Supreme Court betrays the Constitution itself."
csjfdf7,tomjoads,Remind me where the constitution says gays dont equal protection to gays?
csjfou8,immanuel79,It does. But marriage is an arbitrary social contract.It doesn't make sense that because of equal protection it is unlawful to establish one based on the complementarity of sexes. This has nothing to do with equality of all citizens.Even the Chief Justice disagreed.
csjfrbc,tomjoads,No you cant have laws that disenfranchise in group of people. And the majority of the court disagree with Roberts opinion
csjgavu,immanuel79,"Yes you can - if you establish that this social contract is tied to reproduction, you can and you should prevent people that lacks the biological ability to do so to enter it.I remind you that the current new marriage laws ""disenfranchise"" three or more people that are in love. So why sex is no longer important, but marriage is if ""love is love""?At the end of the day, your side think that marriage is about love. I think that love is a great thing, but that the public importance of marriage comes from the potential offspring. We are not disagreeing on equality."
csjgr46,tomjoads,No marriage is not just about having kids. Gays ca have kids. Your points do not hold up
csjgtxb,immanuel79,"Two men or two women cannot yet have kids. What marriage is is subjective, but certainly having kids is more important to society than loving one another.And if it is determined that love and commitment should be the sole driving force behind state and federal marriage laws, then it is utterly and completely illogical to deny five people who love one another the right to marry as a group. Anyone who suggests otherwise is suggesting that government should play favorites and show prejudice."
csjgwym,tomjoads,"No, you cant give five people power of attorney or executives of an estate. Your point again is not valid"
csjhgb7,immanuel79,"Why? You can definitely have legally binding contracts and define ownership between multiple parties - this sounds like a very weak objection.As for the sterility argument that the other user brought, being sterile could be cured and is certainly not a choice. Not to mention that it would be impractical to screen every single couple for fertility - the difference in sex is a good approximation, and while not sufficient it still necessary."
csjhqs0,tomjoads,"Not in the ways that marriage works. Being gay isnt not a choice, and now your saying we aren't going to make people prove they are fertile before marriage? You cant even make a coherent argument"
csjhyt1,immanuel79,"The fact that being gay may or may not be a choice is not relevant to this discussion - people can have children regardless of their sexual orientation, which is way the natural definition of marriage was already equal.I'm not saying that we cannot - I am saying that it would be impractical - although technically it would make sense.Again, if your idea of marriage should be about ""love"", there should be no restriction concerning the number of people involved or even their degree of relationship - I could just as easily ""marry"" my son to save taxes on inheritance."
csji3x6,tomjoads,You just said it being a choice qas relevant andvits not a choice. When did you choose to be straoght? I never mentioned love. Again you contradict yourself and have no argument
csjid83,immanuel79,"Not sure I understand between the typos, but indeed even if sexual orientation is not a choice, having children is only possible between people of the opposite sex.There is no contradiction here, and you who have not addressed my points."
csjijsq,tomjoads,"No i have you keep changing points you already said we cant ban marriage for infertile couples, you defeated your own argument"
csjiu7s,immanuel79,"And I already said that it would logically follows, but that it is impractical - because fertility can often be cured, and it may unknown to the people involved.At the end of the day I am not saying that some people are less equal than the others, but that the will and the ability to have children is more important to society than mutual love and affection.And if you are saying that mutual love and affection qualifies you for perks and rights that other people don't have, then it makes no sense to restrict this to only two people, or between relatives. There is little one can say against this."
csjiy6c,tomjoads,"I never mentioned love, so thenbyour argument makes no sense if infertile couples can marry you have no point"
csjjapi,immanuel79,"Ok, fine, it was actually wrong for me to assume this.Since marriage is arbitrary, what are the requirements for you, and why does it enjoys a special treatment from the State?After all, you are saying that married people have more rights than normal citizens - there must be something of public importance to deserve that.And most importantly, a definition of social contract based on the complementarity of sexes does not violates anyone's equality, PRECISELY because it makes no distinction in race or sexual orientation - which is why even people that support same-sex ""marriage"" cannot claim that the heterosexual one is ""unequal""."
csjjere,tomjoads,"What you make no sense, its unequal becuase gays couldn't enter it with other gays. Marriage is concern to the state mostly due to probate"
csjjrck,immanuel79,"They could not enter with people of the same sex, regardless of sexual orientation. Because originally it was connected inherently with the possibility of children - which is a rational, secular and equal definition.Could I ask you for your answer on my previous question?"
csjjxl1,tomjoads,What question? Except marriage is not based on having kids ypu cant say marriage os based on fertility then say its not worth enforcing for opposite sex couples but we should enforce that idea for gays
csjk66i,immanuel79,"This one:Since marriage is an arbitrary social contract, what are the requirements for you, and why does it enjoys a special treatment from the State?After all, you are saying that married people have more rights than normal citizens - there must be something of public importance to deserve that."
csjk8gp,tomjoads,Becuase probate. I am under no obligation to spell out marriage laws for you.
csjkzic,immanuel79,"If you don't want to answer your choice - but this is the whole reason why same-sex ""marriage"" is illiberal. And bear in mind, this is not a legalistic question - it's an ethical one."
csjl3qa,tomjoads,Your just moving goal posts none of your arguments against have held up . You have no point.
csjlh75,immanuel79,"That was the context from the very beginning - what marriage actually *IS* and why does the State has any stake in it.Because I have nothing against defining a love-oriented social contract, but here you are not asking to introduce one - you are asking (and you just obtained sadly) that it REPLACES the pre-existing definition that was based around having children.I guess that sooner or later, pro-marriage people will have to introduce a new form of marriage which from its very inception is unambiguously defined on procreation."
csjlkri,tomjoads,"Marriage laws are not based on having children, you already defeated that argument. You keep repeating that pount when you already showed that having kids is not required of a marriage"
csjlw2k,immanuel79,"Marriage was always connected to kids and family pretty much in every culture around the world - restrictions in marriage between relatives and some of the benefits it can enjoy are a testament to this.But this is not my point - you can definitely define a social contract that is based solely on affection, but if you were to do so, what would be its requirements and why from those requirements you are entitled to its perks and advantages?Surely an equal, egalitarian state should treat all citizens fairly, thus providing all of them that meet them with the same rewards."
csjme0q,tomjoads,No marriage was never based on kids. Again your your just trying to move goal posts becuase you dont have any legit arguments.
csjpxp2,immanuel79,"Well, historically it was: even in the oh-so homosexual-friendly ancient Greece, they criticized the genius general Hepaminondas: not because he was gay, but because he didn't want to _also_ have a family on top of having gay lovers. Because they believes, as do I, that great people should allow society to benefit from their offspring.And while indeed legally speaking marriage never enshrines the requirement of having a family, the balance of the resources and effort that raising kids cost is the only rational explanation for them.If this is not the case, what is the reason for its perks? After 5 posts, you still have not answered my question."
csjq4bh,tomjoads,Told you twice. Probate
csjqmz4,immanuel79,"So with no other requirement then.In which case, what prevents three people from doing the same? Or even a father and a son? If this is the case, we should cut it short and just decide that everyone can have marriage rights regardless, because limiting it to two people doesn't make much sense anymore."
csjqqk4,tomjoads,"You already tried that argument, no you cant give power of estate to two people. Your argument does not work"
csjr6et,immanuel79,"Why? Who decided that?This is a Legalistic Argument, an arbitrary decision, that may be valid now and today in the US but has no logical or rational validity - anyone who suggests otherwise is suggesting that government should play favorites and show prejudice.No one can credibly argue that three people cannot be in love, and the three-parent structure would offer the children of this marriage a mother and two fathers—role models of both genders, with 50 percent more earning capacity than a two-parent family and many advantages, in terms of built-in child care.So do _you_ think it should stay like this, and if so why?"
csjrzhh,tomjoads,I answered you already. You cant place power of estate to two pepple
csjtsh6,immanuel79,"And again, this is still the logical fallacy called ""legalistic argument""...Look, I know you will not agree with me, I won't illude myself - but do you at least understand why I disagree with you, and why it's not a matter of equality?"
csjtv99,tomjoads,Nope you have no legit argument
csju7bu,immanuel79,"Ok, you don't want to play I get it.Still, just saying it won't make it true."
csjucy6,tomjoads,There ia nothing to play you have no point
csjvl1g,immanuel79,"I am confident that every other reasonable, secular and liberal person reading our exchange would disagree."
csjgxuo,Dublers,So any person beyond his/her reproductive years or sterile/infertile should not be allowed to marry?
csjfdpt,Bacon666,"Yep, it would be sad if they did that. Good thing they didn't do that."
csjffsj,shaved_coconut,"How, exactly?"

It undermines the sanctity of marriage, and further steepens our countries decline from morality. I have no problem with homosexuals, it's their life to live. But when it comes to marriage, it's not their right."
csjzbdz,polymarriage,"I am so disappointed by this ruling, but not for the reasons you might think. In the rule they wrote this""""The nature of marriage is that, through its enduring bond, two persons together can find other freedoms, such as expression, intimacy, and spirituality. This is true for all persons, whatever their sexual orientation.""I'm surprised and disappointed that intimacy, spirituality and the enduring bond I have had with my partners has been officially limited to two people.

csjikl4,TheOriginalAbe,"It will never be okay to have sex with someone that either cannot give consent, or is not old enough to give consent. that being said you cannot make something illegal that is unenforceable such as the sexual desires someone has. If a person gets aroused by children as long as it stays in their mind there is nothing the law can do. so to reiterate sexual desires about children is legal.sexual desires directed at children will never be legal."
csjio2w,-nyx-,How the fuck are those two supposed to be comparable?
csjg2pr,MeltMyCheeseKThxBai,"Since we're redefining marriage to whatever we feel like it is, what other changes could we make? After all, all that's required for a marriage is love, and two people, right? Does that argument hold for close relatives who want to marry, if they love each other? Why not add more spouses; that whole two-person thing is sooo outdated. What authority defined marriage as having two people, right? Certainly not one many of you are willing to recognize, ironically. After all, there's no compelling argument against it since all that's required is love. You don't even need a husband and a wife now."
csjg59i,neoikon,"The concept of marriage has always been evolving.To put it in your terms, it has *always* been ""whatever we feel like it is""."
csjgb6o,MeltMyCheeseKThxBai,"Then what else will we ""feel like it is"" next? I am genuinely curious if SSM supporters also would support polygamist marriages and close relatives marrying. If not, then what is that based on since we can redefine it at will?"
csjgkrx,Running_From_Zombies,"> If not, then what is that based on since we can redefine it at will?[Polygamy harms society](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/367/1589/657.full.pdf) in ways gay marriage doesn't."
csjgz0i,MeltMyCheeseKThxBai,"So the reasons we can't have equal rights for polygamists is because their marriages cause increased rates of rape, robbery, assault, and fraud; as opposed to ""normative"" (how insulting!) monogamy, which decreases it. If we allow polygamists equal rights, it will increase child neglect and abuse. Is that right?"
csjh15m,neoikon,"""Marriage"" is simply a societal construct. There is no physical thing that happens when some pieces of paper are signed and some words are said (I'm married, myself). It is a legal contract that has ramifications on various other societal constructs, such as ownership of ""stuff"" (and many other things).You can throw religious meaning on it, but that's only between the couple involved. That has no impact whatsoever to the rest of society.All that being said, we could say that a ""marriage"" is between a human and a goat, but that's not good for society as a whole, because it greatly interferes with other societal constructs. Similarly with polygamist situations. For example, if a husband dies, then the wife typically inherits their assets. What if there are many wives? Or, how can a goat own a house?It should seem obvious why past generations were against interracial marriages (because different races did not fit within their constructs).Future generations may (and will) redefine marriage. This may include polygamy. It may include redefining it *back* to ""man and woman"" (I hope not).Close relatives marrying involves scientific issues with procreation, obviously. Again, it also interferes with existing society and legal constructs of family relationships.The future is for the young. It's a conveyor belt where we are either on our way in or on our way out. When you get to the point where you are on your way out, you have to either keep up with change or get out of the way."
csjh7ql,MeltMyCheeseKThxBai,"Surely, lawmakers are smart enough to come up with the legal language to give polygamists equal rights? It's not really such a big deal to figure out who owns what. I don't see a real objection here. Is your objection that it's simply too messy legally to give equal rights to polygamists? Let's stick to marriage between humans for now, at least. Close relatives marrying- what if they aren't going to procreate? Nobody said that being married means you have to procreate, right? You just need love. So, no children- is it okay now?"
csjj3c0,neoikon,"Sounds like the polygamists need to speak up, then.It sounds like you're trying to create a problem that isn't there, regarding close relatives marrying."
csjjf46,MeltMyCheeseKThxBai,Why can a hypothetical not be answered?
csjk50n,neoikon,Because you are looking at the answer to that hypothetical question to then be applied to real-world situations.
csjh9zr,neoikon,">I am genuinely curious if SSM supporters also would support polygamist marriages and close relatives marryingIf society changes in such a way that we are no longer individual families, living in our individual boxes, to a society where we live in one large box, where families are very intertwined, where *all* parents raise *all* the kids of the society and the lines of assets are blurred between others within the society, then ""polygamy marriage"" would make more sense.Our current society does not fit this description, but it may in the future... and they may redefine marriage in that direction. It's not for me to decide, but for future generations.(Similarly, we used to be very racially segregated, but our societies became more intertwined, thus interracial marriage eventually became allowed. Not to mention genetic diversity is a good thing (which is what makes ""close relatives marrying"" a bad thing).)"
csjhhzt,MeltMyCheeseKThxBai,"So basically, you are not in favor of polygamist marriage, but do not want to say so. You know that polygamy is already legal in Utah, right (or at least, it's not currently illegal)? So this isn't some issue that can be passed off to another generation- it's already here. Part of our society already fits this description. Are you or are you not saying that you do not support polygamist marriage?"
csjj020,neoikon,"Utah has a large Mormon population, which explains a lot of their laws. Yes, there are rural communities that practice polygamy. However, it's not flat out legal there and it's not widespread among the US. It's not ""already here"" in the same form that there are gay couples are ""already here""... in every state, in every city.However, all that being said, if the concept of polygamy became popular, then sure, modify the definition of marriage. As of right now, there aren't very many people being effected by the current laws because the vast majority do not live in societies the function like a polygamist society."
csjjaxf,MeltMyCheeseKThxBai,"So philosophically, you aren't supporting it because it isn't popular. Also, it's not as important since it only affects a small minority. Am I getting that right? Are you aware that there are over 6.3 million Mormons in the main LDS church alone in the U.S.? Are you aware that the homosexual population is estimated at roughly 4 million? Essentially, you are unwilling or unable to attach any rightness or wrongness to this issue."
csjk2z9,neoikon,"Not all Mormons are polygamists (or live in a polygamy-type society). False comparison. However, if the polygamists don't like the current definition of marriage, they simply need to speak up. At the moment, I don't hear about unhappiness from their camp. If there is, indeed, a big problem there, are you an active supporter of them? Are you pro-polygamy marriage?I'm not really sure why you're attacking me. Obviously, you're angry about this decision and are looking for a scapegoat. I sense a lot of straw-man tactics here.I, personally, don't care what polygamists do, *as long as people aren't hurt in the process* (this is the main take away from all forms that marriage may take). It's common for women to be subordinate and abused in that type of society, which can be a strong negative. However, if they want to live in that type of society, great! I think there are a lot of positives such as closeness, teamwork, and the support of others."

csjj3bp,hteezy,"Excellent result, completely inappropriate avenue to achieve the result."
csjj3tj,,I don't follow...
csjjd33,hteezy,"It's just not the SCOTUS job to hand down this ruling, exactly as Chief Justice Roberts said. We the people have incredible power over ourselves, including the right to introduce and repeal laws. States have inherent power, and the federal government only has power as prescribed to them by the states. The correct way to do this was how it was being done, ratification by every state. Was it taking forever? Absolutely, but it is the way that our country was intended to run. Now SCOTUS has to worry about hearing cases about polygamy, marriage to animals, etc., because they simply couldn't wait for the people to ratify on their own."
csjjga5,,If you say so...
csjjn3h,hteezy,"Less ellipses, more analysis would be refreshing."
csjkauq,,"I mean, I disagree with your conclusions. That's all I really have to add. I think that the Supreme Court has adequately performed their function, and there are certain things that I feel are left up to the federal government rather that state governments. It's more efficient, for one, and it's silly for each state to have their own version of what the constitution means just to fit their constituencies or their own personal religious beliefs.And the polygamy argument, along with marriage to animals, is silly. First of all, animals can't consent to marriage or anything else and it won't be entertained. Polygamy is a different beast all together but I highly doubt anyone will make a big stink about it."
csjjno8,moe-hong,"Isn't the Supreme Court the right place to decide questions of civil rights? Certainly you wouldn't leave such important decisions up to the tyranny of the majority; if we did that, people of different races still wouldn't be allowed to marry each other in many states."
csjky06,,"Can someone please explain this? I'm so confused.Does this mean straight people can't get married unless they are gay, the Government saying we have to be gay?"
csjl3no,GoatsEatingCoins,"Yup, nailed it."

csjysxo,eliminate1337,Supreme Court decisions always come out around this time of year.
csk0hs0,DividedByO,This has literally been considered for years. Just an observation.
csji2af,Kododama,"So a republic really does die to thunderous applause.Honestly after these last two decisions the judges should have all been tar'd, feathered, and run out of town. Unelected judges have no ability to write/augment laws and should be stripped of their posts immediately for attempting to do so."
csjjls5,Kododama,"Honestly the fact that anybody would downvote this is sad. It shows a real lack of respect for your own rights. For those who can't figure out what I mean, the SCOTUS only has the power to judge whether a law stands or not. They have no authority to legalize anything, nor do they have the power to redefine a law that is before them.If this had come out the other way and they had banned SS marriage I would be just as pissed because, in the same way they have no power to legalize, they also have no power to ban. A three year old could have seen that the only legal response the court had to this case was to throw it out and tell them to come back when the case is about a law passed by congress. tl;drOnly congress can pass laws and declare war, the president can only sign the laws and control the military, the supreme court can only give a yes or a no on whether a law passed by congress (both the federal and the state ones) violates the constitution."
csjjriw,,Incorrect. State laws are also bound by the constitution.
csjkgh8,Kododama,"You are correct, except this case went about it backwards. The law was that people can marry in their state. The argument was that other states should honor the marriages from those states. The ruling was that 14th amendment says you should be able to marry in every state. In no way is that chain of events allowed under the supreme courts powers.While you may not like it because it's not as fast as giving someone the supreme authority to just do something, the legal way to go about this would have been to elect representatives who share your view and have them create the law in your state. I'm playing devils advocate here on this topic, but I have serious problems with the way this court has decided to abuse their authority."

Prior to 1962, homosexuality was a *felony*. When that was repealed, that should have been the end of it. But it got dragged on for another 50 years. Same thing with pot, too. In 1970 we have the Controlled Substances Act - now we get a nice lengthy, drawn out, and expensive process in which it's repealed because government and the governed don't communicate well in this ""democracy."""
csjgzt2,navygent,"And now we don't have to spend 80 % of our news stories with 10% of the population complaining about their rights. You all can go home now, bye. What's next? Left Handers!

All the signs on the highway everything should read in all languages equally. If we want to be truly equal."
csjhxm4,,"You have the right to get left handed doors and cars if you want. Also, government services offer those languages, although I think with street signs it's simply impractical to offer more than one language. Although when technology makes it practical to have signs that instantly translate to your preferred language, I think the 14th amendment would force the states to use it."

csjiz6d,macaco_gordinho,"The issue isn't about state law. It's about giving everyone equal rights under the law. Some states used to have laws that said if you weren't the same race you couldn't marry each other. That was a state law. I think we can both agree that was not something that should have ever been. Regardless of your opinion on same sex couples, you can't deny the right of one person to be able to marry another person. Plain and simple."
csjjvvm,JordanCardwell,"This is silly. Civil unions are neither rights, nor marriages, nor necessary. We could abolish all civil unions tomorrow, including heterosexual, and marriage would persist and be much better off.Rights are things you innately possess, that can only be taken by force.

Maybe it's because picking up and moving is a difficult, expensive decision which requires removing yourself from the company of friends and family, shedding a social network which could get you places in life, and limits career choices overall.The federal government's right to impose its will over a state is in Article III of the United States Constitution.>The judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices during good Behavior, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office....

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.It starts in the Declaration of Independence:>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed...If you want to disagree with the SCOTUS ruling, you'd have to believe that bans on same-sex marriage do not abridge the privileges of US citizens. To insist the Supreme Court judges don't have the right to interpret the 14th Amendment, you have to reject the article of the constitution which establishes the judicial branch's right to rule on the scope of Constitutional law."

Literally nothing bad will happen to the general public now that gay couples are allowed to get married, which by the way, has medical and tax repercussions that would otherwise be unavailable to gay couples who couldn't get married before.As a citizen of this wonderful country we call the United States, that has long been a melting pot of cultures and beliefs, you should be glad that your fellow countrymen/women can now partake in the highs and lows of the institution of marriage. Why anyone would want to keep their fellow Americans down in terms of receiving equal rights?"
csk5m5q,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"If living in the same state as a married gay couple counts as oppression, all of your bitching and moaning is oppressing me. Can I get a majority to agree on this so he'll be democratically obligated to shut up?"

csjm0s1,macaco_gordinho,If that tree willingly consents to marry you... YOU BETTER DO IT! And call the news people bc that tree has cognitive thought.
csjmeij,xenemorph,Yes I want trees to be able to legally consent. We should also allow kids to legally consent and marry eachother. If they can have a boyfriend/girlfriend they should be able to get married.
csjmimd,macaco_gordinho,"Well if you hear a tree legally consent to you then call all the news people because that would be the most amazing thing to happen in the world. Unfortunately, children have to be a certain age for consent so unless they are at that age they won't be allowed to do so until they meet the requirement of the law. Of course, some states allow parents to provide consent. Maybe kids should go there and get their parent's permission as well."
csjmkc2,xenemorph,No I'm saying kids are humans too and they're able to consent. We should start advocating for them to be able to get married since they're getting discriminated against for merely not being 18 years old. Many are independent and can make their own decisions before 18.
csjn80r,macaco_gordinho,"And in certain states they can petition based on consent laws. But to say that children should marry because consenting adults of the same sex can is argumentum ad absurdum, meaning you are taking your arguement to the extreme to prove your point to be right over the truth of the fact. The fact being that all legal adults who have the right to consent should be able to exercise their right when they both agree to marry, regardless of sexual orientation. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it should be against the law. Black people weren't allowed to use the same bathrooms, eat at the same table, and ride on the same spots of a bus as white people at one point. Women at one point weren't allowed to legally vote. And slaves were considered 3/5 of a person. A human being sold to another human being. So get off the internet, have a coke and a smile and STFU :)"

""If what consenting adults do harms other people and society at large by increasing crime, degrading women's rights, and promoting child death.""That has nothing to do with anything. If you are saying that all of these think result from polygamy, then I bet you i could come up with a ""study"" that says bad things result from gay marriage, drinking coffee, playing video games, owning cats etc., etc., etc. They fact of the matter is that the homosexual marriage lobby will be complete hypocrites until they support legal polygamist marriages."
csjpwnp,Phoenixwade,"That'll take a while, though today's decision might be a small step in the direction of allowing people to decide for themselves as to how a relationship works, there is far less support, and it's much harder to provide understanding, for a plural marriage model."

Most states had legislated prohibitions or constitutional amendments blocking gay marriage. Judges undid them, not the people.Our fore fathers found themselves in a similar situation, wherein the decisions and actions of the authorities became unbearable. They were willing to risk their lives, fortunes and sacred honor. It has become time to stand up and be counted.

A ""marriage"" is, by definition, two people joining into an equal, even union. That's simple. Things get impossible to legislate once you bring more than two people into it. 3.) No: see polygamy.4.) No, because dead people are no longer citizens. They are dead; and thus, cannot enter into contracts.5.) Children are minors and thus cannot enter into legally-binding contracts. Also, there are significant studies (and common sense knowledge) that tells us that children are severely traumatized and harmed by being sexualized at a young age. Hope this helps."

csjfy33,doxaloxa,"There's a difference, technically, between people's rights and voting on how a state wants to define an institution. There has to be some definition of marriage, who can enter it, how many times, how old the people must be etc.... Otherwise anyone can enter into it and that is the exact chaos people say is crazy to assume will happen.So as soon as you do the logical thing and define marriage you automatically will prohibit someone or someone(s) from marrying who they want because it simply won't be a marriage due to the definition.The issue from the start wasn't that a specific person was not allowed to get married. Every single adult had that right. The issue was who they could enter into a marriage with. I have the legal right to vote, but I can't vote for an office that doesn't exist or vote for an office like a congressional district other than my own."
csjg3ct,tomjoads,Your argument is sophmoric. You dont vote on rights you cant deny protection of the law to a class of people.
csjie9h,doxaloxa,It's not protection of the law. Every single adult had the same right (previously) to marry another single adult of the opposite sex. That was equal protection. What was desired was to expand that right (or definition of marriage) to say every single adult had the right to marry one other single adult of either gender.
csjiid0,tomjoads,With your argument bans agaisnt inter racial or mixed religious marriages could be prohibited . Can a stat declare a jew and christian cant marry becuase they equally can marry someone off thier own religuon? Again your argument is sophmoric
csjis24,doxaloxa,"Again, the laws on the books WERE that the definition of marriage was between one (single adult) man and one (single adult) woman. Any combination of races could marry or religions. Your comment doesn't make any sense. Every single adult had the same protection of the law.What laws did you think were active? What state was banning inter-racial marriages?"
csjivyo,tomjoads,Your argument was the same one used against interacial and mix religious marriages. You dont even understand the arguments you are trying to make. Whats the difference between saying gays are equal becuase they can marry the opposite sex and saying its equal becuase no one can be in a mixed relationship?
csjj29q,doxaloxa,So did the Supreme Court say what the definition of marriage is or who could define it? One way or another it gets defined and limits the scope of marriage meaning someone somewhere can't marry who or what they want.

csjo4yc,,Look at all the gold being thrown around. Well suits this gay related thread it's in. Like its a celebration in reddit.
csjodmn,Morningwood35,"Personally I could careless what people want to do with other people is their business, as long as it doesn't involve kids, I'm cool with it, but just because the supreme court says its ok doesn't mean that everyone is going to accept it, its not a magic wand thats what is great about America not everyone has to agree and thats ok."
csjop1g,rainman_104,"> but just because the supreme court says its ok doesn't mean that everyone is going to accept it, Slowly it'll change, much like things changed after the civil rights movement."
csjowsv,Morningwood35,"Right, but not all people are going to accept it, has nothing to do with time has to do with their beliefs everyone is different thats what makes america great, plus marriage is a contract between two people has nothing to do with the government."
csjqrbz,rainman_104,Well the government lays out the legal benefits of marriage such as family law with divorce and children and alimony etc and estates and wills. Seems reasonable government has a stake in looking after these particular matters of law. Beyond that government has zero skin in the game imo.
csk4gh5,Morningwood35,"right but that decides on property, going into marriage is a choice not a right thats why is not a civil right.......gays were not treated like black people during the jim crowe days"
csjotb0,Axel927,"At this point, it doesn't matter whether or not some official ""accepts"" gay marriage. It comes down to will they obey the law or not."
csjpb0u,Morningwood35,The law can not change what people think simple truth.
csjpe38,Axel927,And what I'm saying is that the law doesn't give a shit whether you think it is a simple truth or not. The law only asks you to obey or face the consequences.
csjpp91,Morningwood35,"problem is the law can't force people to violate their religious beliefs.....that's discrimination just what the gay rights advocates are fighting against, the law is not absolute, it's not a blanket fix."
csjptxx,Axel927,"You're right. The law cannot tell pastors, or churches, or whomever, that they *must* officiate gay weddings. And I doubt a case will come up that forces caterers to accept gay weddings, or photographers to photograph gay weddings.That wasn't the issue here. The issue was whether or not states are allowed to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The Court said no. The state, as an institution, must recognize all same-sex marriages as valid."
csjq2ht,Morningwood35,"I agree problem is government has nothing to do with marriage and pretty much all governments local, state, and federal. recognize same-sex marriage, the problem was private business providing benefits coverage to same sex dependants now they have to which is fine they should have too, but I.e a florist who happens to disagree with gay marriages on religious beliefs cannot be forced to provide a service"
csjqdqd,Spokebender,"Yeah, so you save those Confederate dollars..."
csjqj2x,Morningwood35,"I'm all for same sex marriage, because it doesnt effect me and or my marriage, but it cant force other people to violate their beliefs"
csjqxtc,Spokebender,"SCOTUS didn't ask you to violate your beliefs, you're as free to be a bigot today as you were yesterday."
csjxrdx,Morningwood35,"so your asking for people to be tolerant on gay marriage but when someone doesn't believe in your point of view their a bigot, sounds like you lost the argument and have no substance for a discussion good day"
csk5gs9,Spokebender,"*You're.*They're.You're still as free to be a bigot today as you were yesterday. Nobody asked or expects you to change your beliefs. Try actually reading the ruling instead of saying stupid shit.Oh, and have a fucked up day. You've earned it."
csk6e07,Morningwood35,"personal attacks just hurt your credibility sir thats the problem with people who are intolerant of other people beliefs you need to use your big boy words, they resort to personal attacks and if you understand the ruling it says all states must allow gay marriage it does not say that all private citizens must do what they say its called freedom and if you want all people to think and do what you want I know Russia is looking for a good few dictators"
csk6xfi,Spokebender,"Piss poor spelling and lack of punctuation destroy *your* credibility by making you appear to be lazy and uncaring about whatever you're trying to say.I'm not intolerant of whatever stupid things you choose to believe, I simply couldn't care less, and I mean that from the bottom of my heart. So in conclusion, kindly fuck off."
csk739u,Morningwood35,well I guess if punctuation is your main argument you dont have one ....aight too bad you have reduce the conversation to profanity and semantics. ...
csk8xui,Spokebender,"No, it's not my main argument, it's why I have zero respect for your opinion. Oh and your not reading the actual ruling and just shooting your worthless opinion from the hip. Yeah, pretty sure I said that too.Which part of fuck off are you having a problem with?"
csjoofc,lenowt,>I could carelessI couldn't care less*
csjpix0,TraceAgain,"But what really astounds is the hubris reflected in today's judicial Putsch. The five Justices who compose today's majority are entirely comfortable concluding that every State violated the Constitution for all of the 135 years between the Fourteenth Amendment's ratification and Massachusetts' permitting of same-sex marriages in 2003. They have discovered in the Fourteenth Amendment a “fundamental right” overlooked by every person alive at the time of ratification, and almost everyone else in the time since… These Justices know that limiting marriage to one man and one woman is contrary to reason; they know that an institution as old as government itself, and accepted by every nation in history until 15 years ago, cannot possibly be supported by anything other than ignorance or bigotry. And they are willing to say that any citizen who does not agree with that, who adheres to what was, until 15 years ago, the unanimous judgment of all generations and all societies, stands against the Constitution. - Justice Scalia"
csjqcku,electricmink,Now slightly rephrase that as needed to apply to slavery or interracial marriage and see what it sounds like.....
csjpxtq,schorschico,> limiting marriage to one man and one woman... and accepted by every nation in history until 15 years ago...This is so plainly false that it is painful.
csjpy9f,colin8696908,wait so this overrules all constitutional bans. Thats odd normally they leave it up to states to decide.
csjqfk1,,"Just like they left slavery and inter racial marriage up to the states right? And yes, the federal constitution is superior to every state constitution. That's sort of how this works."
csjq98g,loki8481,"this ruling clarifies that those constitutional bans violate the 14th Amendment of the Federal constitution, which supersedes them and thus makes the state laws illegal."
csjqh2n,leatherdaddy14,"The institution of marriage is a joke anyway with the 50% or greater divorce rate.

csjs6vy,neoblackdragon,You define marriage as you define marriage. It's your own damn fault if you can't make it work(barring situations where it's clearly the other persons fault).

csk384q,msthe_student,Depends on what law you're considering
csk5g15,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,Just for being gay? Probably.
csjhxvq,detectiive,"I will probably get downvoted, but it is sad that our Nation is going so far from it's roots and heritage. This just puts the cherry on top. I don't 'hate' gay people, i love people, but i don't agree that gay marriage is right. You cannot make a dad out of a girl, and a mom out of a boy. It is not in our genes, it is not in our human nature. This will disrupt the idea of family, and if we continue like this, we will begin to condone anything under the ""banner of love and not being exclusive"". I wish we were a nation that did not compromise to please people, but that we were a nation to be strong on our constitution and heritage. It's okay, I know my opinion here is very little and will be lost and misunderstand by many that have a vision of ""lets include everyone in everything because thats freedom, that's america""....but it's not. if we could only see the long term results rather than appeasing our need for instant results."
csji0p4,steffx,> if we could only see the long term results rather than appeasing our need for instant results.Look at any other country that's had same-sex marriage legalised for years. Nothing terrible has happened.
csji9ed,chunes,The religious pretext behind that comment is pretty obvious. There's no convincing people who put their faith in the bible
csjik96,steffx,"Honestly that's why I only responded to the last comment. I know how difficult it can be to change people's opinions, especially ones that are based on religious beliefs. The fact that equal marriage hasn't negatively impacted other countries speaks louder than anything else I could say. Although I'm sure it could be twisted to look negative if people reached enough."
csjj349,detectiive,"But people with faith in the bible tend to have a long term perspective, because they have the assurance of hope. While now a days it is ""survival of the fittest"" ""my needs now"" and ""it doesnt matter what happens yolo"". There is little sense of how we will impact our generations to come.Like i said gay couples cannot replace fathers and mothers, it is not in human nature."
csjioz6,detectiive,"1979 - Netherlands, 1989 - Denmark. It was only 25+ years ago. That is not long term. Long term in the sense of Columbus coming to America and the implications of that. The revolutionary war, the implications of becoming a new country. The next generation and the following. But as we, the US (who has great influence - slowly fading), this will then make room for pedophiles, cheese pizza, bestiality, etc. And most will be like ""ew gross never"", but they were the same way a century ago. It changes things. But we are too short sited and people pleasers, we cannot stick with our heritages and convictions. (do not twist my words, and assume something, read in it's context and as examples)"
csjtc37,AlwaysGetsIt,"> this will then make room for pedophiles, cheese pizza, bestialityThe key distinction is ability to give consent. Children, animals, and pizzas all cannot give consent. Adult people can. Your slippery slope prediction fails because of this"
csjvzfe,detectiive,"People will find a way and try to twist the law. Just as they did with marriage. Originally, man and woman, it was/is the natural order, normality. Then when one party felt excluded and offended, and people saw it under 'love' rather than just selfish ambition, deciding, ""F my heritage, forget my culture, lets change it because this is the way i want it now, and i deserve to have what i want."" Skewing marriage as tradition and normal human nature to making it an issue where if you opposed it, you were a cruel human being not letting someone love.-If gay's are about equal rights, and having the voice being heard? Why do they shut down other religions and opposing voices? It is not equal rights, its selfish ambition, with no thought of the future. The same will happen with animals - ""i really love my dog and my dog loves me, then why can't i get married. It's not hurting anyone? It's just love."" My slippery slope prediction does not fail. Once you start compromising in values that have been upheld for generations and losing your heritage and what your country used to stand for, it starts compromising in a lot of areas."
csjxonm,AlwaysGetsIt,">People will find a way and try to twist the law.And what way would that be exactly that would allow people to marry animals?>""i really love my dog and my dog loves me, then why can't i get married.

Also animals are considered property - oh wait, that wouldn't get in the way, religion considered women property not too long ago.>it was/is the natural order, normality.Define natural - there are a lot of gay animals. Define normal - anybody who is like you? How convenient for you.>Then when one party felt excluded and offended, and people saw it under 'love' rather than just selfish ambition, deciding, ""F my heritage, forget my culture, lets change it because this is the way i want it now, and i deserve to have what i want.""I think this was one of the best arguments for keeping slavery around not too long ago.>Why do they shut down other religions and opposing voices?What religious rights have been compromised? Nobody is forcing you to get gay married. Your rights end where others' rights begin. Your religion does not get to impose rules on other people."
cska3dj,detectiive,"I was not saying marrying animals, but the fact that our tolerance of things has lessened and not for the better.That is my main argument. That we have gone noble and a humble country to we do whatever we want. Normal - I am only mentioning the natural order of things. If you believe in God you believe in a sacred covenant of marriage (which is where we got marriage from in the first place). If not, and say you are an atheist and you believe in evolution, then you believe in survival of the fittest, and therefore to survive as humans, homosexuality does not reproduce, in fact a lot of studies have shown the psychological as well as health concerns from same-sex sex.That was not an argument to keep slavery. Slavery was from another source before America, and as America was being birthed, that was one of the issues. Not to mention the main people behind the end of slavery (talking about equality) were the Christians, William Wilberforce, Martin Luther King Jr, Abraham Lincoln to name a few. I am saying that as the world reacts to this, anyone who has an opposing voice to gay marriage is immediately excluded and marked as judgmental and hateful. Why? Because we do not want to offend anyone, we want to be included, we want to be relevant. There is this talk of equality, yet it is one sided and anyone against it is marked as foolish. And you can refer to my original comment where I simply stated my opinion and it was down voted immediately and people responding like yourself with sarcasm rather than respecting equally an opposing opinion. Overall, look at the trend of our country going from noble, respected, God-fearing, and trusted leading nation to slowly decaying and slowly losing tolerance to topics that only a couple decades ago would have made us blush in embarrassment is now our entertainment. This only leads to the opening or more and more topics that once were regarded as lawless to acceptable, because we feel right now is more important than the long run."
csntsko,AlwaysGetsIt,">our tolerance of things has lessenedNo, our *in*tolerance of things has lessened>and not for the betterThat's your unjust personal opinion>I am only mentioning the natural order of things.Define *""natural""*, because gay sex happens in thousands of different species, so...>If you believe in GodI don't, and neither should anyone>you believe in a sacred covenant of marriage (which is where we got marriage from in the first place).No, it's not where we got marriage from. Marriage was first and always has been a contract. Nothing to do with religion until religion tried to hijack it.>if you ~~believe in~~ *accept* evolutionFTFY.>homosexuality does not reproduceSo what? Homosexuality is still a product of evolution. There are clearly still enough heterosexuals for the species to continue. This is a dumb argument.>in fact a lot of studies have shown the psychological as well as health concerns from same-sex sexYes, I'm sure there are a lot of studies done by conservative religious groups showing that. They're not credible. Even if it was true, so what? People are free to do as they please, even if it causes them harm.>the main people behind the end of slavery were the Christians.Your immoral bible advocates slavery. Just because people who sought to end slavery happened to be Christians, it's not because their Christianity prompted them to. They did it *despite* what their Christianity taught them. What the hell has this got to do with Gay Marriage?>anyone who has an opposing voice to gay marriage is immediately excluded and marked as judgmental and hateful.Because being opposed to equality at the expense of others, especially when it would have no affect on you at all, is judgmental and hateful.>I simply stated my opinion and it was down votedBigoted opinions rightfully garner scorn and down votes>trend of our country going from noble, respected, God-fearing, and trusted leading nationGod-fearing is not a positive aspect for a country. Fortunately you're wrong, the country has been secular since its founding.>to slowly decaying and slowly losing toleranceAgain, that's your very backward opinion. This country has never been so noble and respected as it is now, and we are gaining tolerance, not losing it. >This only leads to the opening or more and more topics that once were regarded as lawless to acceptable, because we feel right now is more important than the long run.Fallacious slippery slope argument."

csjnin5,Better_Call_Salsa,"I'd rather ""biological overpopulation stop-gap measure"" if it didn't sound so eugenics-ish. To say it's a ""defect"" is to say it lessens their utility, but they can still have children and raise them just fine. You're saying they ""can't reproduce"" but actually they can and do. In the event that they don't have children in some fashion, they have effectively aided society by reducing their population vector, lessening the impact of overpopulation for future generations. What nice folks!A mental disability suggests that they are incapable of proper thought. All of the gay individuals I've met don't seem to be incapable of proper thought, seem to be just fine at it. Nature selected them to be gay, just like it does in other species, for some reason. They have no ""defect"" or ""disability"" because they easily reproduce and don't (naturally) die any sooner than heterosexuals. ...ugg that sounded extra eugenics-ish. eep."

About the kids part, lesbians can easily have kids with sperm donation and gays have a little harder because they need a surogate mother. I don't think it will be a problem in the future because i bet artificial wombs will exist though."
csjy21u,fake_n00b,"I don't even know where to begin. To put anal sex as equal to 99% of vaginal sex is like saying masturbating is like 99% of vaginal sex since it doesn't lead to birth. I am talking about the purpose of marriage, not in the biblical sense, but in the sense that all of the tribes/societies on earth that have survived the wars have the institution of marriage, and basic set of moral code. For homosexuality, this is something deemed perverse by all societies until 21st century west/USA suddenly found enlightenment and decided to grant them equality under the law.

csjxbl9,radialomens,"> the purpose of marriage between a man and a woman is to support stability in sexual relations between a man and woman for the purposes of child rearing.So should couples who can't have children abstain from marriage?""The purpose of marriage"" is what you make of it. There is no single purpose that can be applied to every case. Your definition is a more historical example, one that might explain its origin, but that's not ""the purpose"" for many people today.No one gets to decide ""the purpose of marriage."" Historically it's been a holy union, a prize in war, a tool in diplomacy, a way to improve the social standing of a family, a consolation, a form of paternity assurance, a trade in bartering, a resolution to inter-tribal disputes, and more.Culturally, marriage is often considered an expression of love and commitment. It's a unification of two people under the law. It's a bundle of rights that makes the joinder of two lives possible. There's no reason to deny that to same-sex couples."
csjxvls,fake_n00b,"Your arguments are all true to my 21st century worldview, but ""there is no reason to deny that to same sex couples"" is a line of reasoning could have applied in the 18th century, 1st century, or any other time. But that line of reasoning never made any sense to people during any other civilization at any other time. This LGBT movement is fairly recent and to me, I don't understand it."
csjy3mn,radialomens,"Many civil rights are fairly new. Women's suffrage is extremely new, as is women being able to divorce or domestic violence being illegal. Abolition of slavery in the western world is new, and so racial tolerance, interracial marriage, and a general disapproval of racism. Stoning people for being heretics, witches, pagans, atheists, satanists, etc. is no longer common place.Society has made many overhauls in the previous two centuries that were practically unpredictable if you came from a time before them. Diversity in thought is more acceptable, which reduces the fear of a religious morality and encourages people to try things out and find out, ""Hey, treating black people like humans isn't so bad,"" or ""Turns out gay people don't corrupt children."""
csjywpr,fake_n00b,"I might be stuck in a ""time before them."" There are many social issues which I disagree in the manner in which society deals with, or at least the narrative that is presented. Much like how the standard way high schools teach about civil war was about slaves freedoms. Except if you examine any war in the world, no one gives a rats ass about other people, especially the ones with no power. Look at how little we did in darfur as hundreds of thousands were dying, or any of the man other wars where those in power did nothing. The most credible explanation for the civil war I've heard is that it was more likely about a clash of differing economic systems- with the south dependent on slaves as an asset, while the north had a different system where the banks were race blind and allowed people to become enslaved to debt instead. By freeing the slaves, the north effectively erased the majority of the wealth of the south in an instant since slaves were free and no longer an asset. The end result to the north's economic system winning is that the people most enslaved to the north's system were blacks in the end anyways. That is beside the point- I am hoping for someone to give me similar economic answer, a selfish answer why those in power would allow this. The closest reasoning I have- is that I see those succeeding in many professions are gay. I am a physician and in the teaching hospital where I work at, something like half of the psychiatry residents are gay. As far as I can tell, these trends are due to the advancement of our institutions, and the slow self realization that certain groups are more useful if they are happy. i.e. gay psychiatry residents will do a better job and become better psychiatrists if they are allowed to marry."
csjzdu5,radialomens,"As more and more gay people came out, people like you have realized that they're functioning members of society and not the sexual deviants that historical rhetoric made them out to be. Almost everyone at this point knows someone who is gay, which over time changes public opinion from ""I need to protect my children from sodomy"" to ""I want John to be happy.""As public opinion changes, the position that gay people (or in the past black people and women) are a class which should be given limited rights is no longer a popular platform for a politician. Culture shifts and votes speak. Gay people and their allies vote, which makes it even easier to support them than, say, women's suffrage, because you gain constituents with a pro-gay platform.Also unlike women and blacks during their oppression under the government, closeted gay people have been able to achieve success, power and influence. They make up a portion of the ""liberal elite"" stereotype; a class of educated, wealthy, politically-involved individuals with liberal opinions. This gives them a stronger say than the average Joe, and their eventual coming out further reinforces the lesson in society that it's ""normal"" to be gay.America (and the west) has become a lot less religious than a century or two ago. Fewer people are concerned with what God thinks and more interested in forming their own opinions. Also, there's a growing number of ""casual"" religious people, who identify as either culturally or habitually religious (like Irish Catholics) but don't take it as seriously as people did a few centuries ago.Additionally, there's a lot of money to be made from gay marriage. Seriously, if I personally had been thinking of getting married in the next 3-6 months I would hold off because the venues, caterers and florists are going to be booked solid for a while."

I am asking for serious replies please.When you ask a serious question, one that isn't based upon ridiculous assumptions, I'll consider giving you a serious reply."
csjxwtb,fake_n00b,ridiculous assumptions of what? that anal sex is the defining feature of male homosexuality? Or the perverse part? because during any other time in recorded history it was considered perverse except 20th-21st century western civilization.
csjzqdr,BlindLemonLars,"Pretty much everything you write is ridiculous, but I am specifically referring to your spectacularly bigoted and ignorant reference to anal sex as being ""a defining feature of male homosexuality."" It speaks volumes about your character and intelligence level."

csk00na,fake_n00b,"do you acknowledge that people can have differing political views? Calling me bigoted and ignorant based on my views reminds me of some highly intelligent people I know who are quite closed minded. I am quite comfortable with my character and intelligence level. I mention anal sex as a defining feature because it is. I am not the one who came up with it, or decided to consider homosexuality perverse. This is something that has existed for all time until our generation decided homosexuality deserves equal rights. I am sure its nice everyone gets equal rights, but I am just not buying the equality for all rhetoric. The media speaks of equality under the law for homosexuals as if it is something long due, as if the rest of humanity are a bunch of savages for preventing this day from happening earlier."
csk08ta,BlindLemonLars,"You clearly spend a lot of time worrying about anal sex. Do you frequently wake up in a cold sweat, your head filled with visions of penises plunging into anuses? You should talk to someone about that, perhaps a therapist, or a trusted member of the clergy.Grow up, little boy. Adults don't concern themselves with what other consenting adults do with their private parts. Mind your own god damn business."

I suggest you do that and then re-evaluate who is the one with the questionable character and intelligence level.Oh, I have and I stand by my statements. Your ""sincere"" question is based upon a falsehood, your reducing gay marriage to ""having anal sex is what it is."" You're the one obsessed with buttsex pal, you really should look into yourself and find out what that's all about. I have no strong feelings about the subject, just like most people. I see now you've doubled down on ignorant statements, claiming ""of course this 'homosexuality is normal' thought process is a very new idea."" News flash kiddo, it's not a new idea. Homosexuality has existed since the beginning of mankind and even happens elsewhere in the animal kingdom. The fact that homosexuality has always existed *is the very definition of normal.* It was considered perfectly acceptable in ancient Greece and Rome...the idea that it's shameful or somehow not ""normal"" is a relatively recent development and one primarily driven by oppressive, Abrahamic religions. Sincere questions aren't based upon false statements. Your question assumes we all agree that traditional marriage is all about procreating and gay marriage is all about anal sex. Neither assumption is true and any question based upon those statements is not worthy of serious consideration."

csjpkbr,Spokebender,I must have missed that part where we got to vote on who has rights and who doesn't. When did that happen?
csjq2rp,WiznerowiczClan,"We've always had the right to vote on what's right and wrong. As long as everyone has the same rights no one has had their rights taken away.

csjr8c8,Spokebender,"You should get some counseling, your moral compass is spinning out of control."
csjt16x,DividingSolid,"So gays couldn't marry one another and straights could and that's somehow equal? What rights have been taken away again? Your still the same asshole, just more likely to be violent, like a child who couldn't get his way."
csjtd9i,WiznerowiczClan,That's odd because I'm pretty certain any one could have married any one of the opposite sex. That's actually exactly how equal is defined. Everyone has the same limits and opportunities. My right to vote was taken away and so was yours in fact. And yes I think violence is a very reasonable solution when you don't get your way. That is actually what everything thinks. You just pay someone else to be violent for you and pretend it's not you doing it.
csjvfbn,DividingSolid,"So why can't I marry someone of the same sex if I want to? Because it offends you? Sorry but you lost, in fact if we did vote, current polling was heading for equality so you would have lost anyways. Also more then half the country was already legalizing same sex marriage you just find some excuse because you have nothing to aspire to. Also your logic is dumb it's basically saying vote for my way or I'll kill you. Get some help."
csjwadl,WiznerowiczClan,"At the very least if I would have lost a vote I wouldn't feel like my rights were taken away. That alone is a reason to violently resist. But secondly, yes, on an issue like this I would say vote my way or fight me. Because this is a matter of right and wrong, and all it takes for evil to succeed is good men do nothing. And in case it's not clear, you are the evil man."
csjwff6,DividingSolid,So the Supreme Court was apparently doing something illegal huh? And how would you know better then them. Why are you so adamant in stripping people's rights away. What is evil about anybody LGBT? After all it is only you that wants to see people dead. That would make you pretty damn evil. All I'm doing is arguing with some asshole because my game loading. And also what is the point of voting if the other side violently resists? What is your stance on the Civil Rights act I'm genuinely curious.
csjwstz,WiznerowiczClan,"According to all 4 of the dissents, yes they did something illegal. No one's rights are being stripped, though I do think yours should. Acting homosexual is evil. If you had any sense of justice you would want to see some people dead. And that is the problem with all governments, eventually they become evil. And I think the civil rights act should be amended to specific exclude things that aren't inherent in your genetic coding."
csjwx53,DividingSolid,Lmao your so full of yourself. I think your late your Klan meeting I hear there low in numbers. And how the hell do gays affect you? Why are they evil and your not?
csjx9yp,WiznerowiczClan,"I love that I'm a racist and a terrorist because I disagree with you, but I'm full of myself. Gays affect me the same way a person getting murdered in a different state affects me. And why is lying evil and telling the truth not?"
csjxijn,DividingSolid,> exclude things that aren't inherent in your genetic coding.That's sounds damn racist to me. So your saying Gays don't affect you but you want to start a violent conflict because things didn't go your way. Why is acting homosexual evil?
csjxlxv,WiznerowiczClan,"Race is in genetic coding, how is that racists? You inherent your parents race through your genome. I thought you would understand that I am effected by someone murdering someone even if I'm not involved. And why is anything evil?"
csjxoi7,DividingSolid,Because it sounds like you don't want interracial relationships either. So gay sex is murder now? Your as smart a rock. http://i.imgur.com/nnF6Il1.jpg
csjxyfn,WiznerowiczClan,"How could it possibly sound like I'm against interracial marriage. You just want to find reasons not to like me so you come up with ridiculous ideas because you're a moron. And gay sex might as well be murder. They're just as bad as the other. Which actually perfectly well circles back around to why I'm ready to kill over this. If anything you are the inconsistent one, and you've literally been outsmarted every time you've said something, but I'm the one who's smart as a rock. Man the world would be better off without you."
csjy6xp,DividingSolid,I don't think so buddy. Nobody dies in gay sex but you're willing to kill people because they had sex? You honestly want to murder people because they decided to have consensual sex? You haven't been out smarting me at all actually it's just that your so crazy that you will possibly wind up in the news for mass murder. I don't need to find reasons to dislike you. Your first post indicated everything about you.
csjyged,WiznerowiczClan,"And yet you continue to try and add reasons not to like me that are completely made up. Out smarting is an over statement, humans don't out smart bananas. It's more like completely superior to you in every way. And no I don't want to murder people for having consensual sex, I want to overthrow an evil government and arrest people for doing bad things."

csjfqay,lolamp33,but I disagree with 1 of those 2what if the supreme court decided to become radically right-wing - would that be okay with you?checks/balances of power is typically a good thing
csjfu5e,diefree85,There has to be a body interpreting the constitution as the world changes. They ruled just like they did in Brown vs. Board of education.
csjg1cj,lolamp33,"all those ruling are nice, because they have always been progressive (so far), and the nation eventually catches up so its all historically goodbut what if the supreme court decided tomorrow that abortion was wrong all along, and denying segregation was wrong too (businesses have a right)it seems like an awful lot of power to give to some people to personally exercise on a whim - they arent worrying about any constituencies either"
csjg5jx,diefree85,Not really it's a balance. They can only rule on if something is or is not constitutional. They cannot create laws or change them. They could rule bans on abortion are constitutional but historically the supreme court as been balanced and objective. It's also why there's 9 of them.
csjgm57,lolamp33,"so why does this make gay marriage LEGAL (as if enacting law)shouldnt this ruling simply make gay marriage not ILLegal - determining that the constitution would not expressly deny itand of course the supreme court is biased, its run by flawed men, who seemingly answer to just themselves"
csjgp0v,diefree85,"It means all the bans on it are not valid. Which means they have to recognize it. No new law was created. They also ruled marriage fell under the 14th amendment. So basically you can't just ban ""gay marriage"" anymore than you can ban interracial marriage."
csjgxqx,lolamp33,"that is a miiiighty stretch (and sets precedent that gayness = racialness)but however they arrived at their decision (I really dont care, theyll make up something however), they still shouldnt be imposing something so swiftly on the nation all by themselvesthey are essentially legalizing things, by making it impossible to make certain things illegal (unless a gigantic constitutional amendment was made to counter - and even then Im sure theyd find a ruling to wiggle around that too)I resent the agenda pushing is all - and agendas can theoretically go BOTH ways, so fear it too"
csjh0i5,diefree85,"They are not unless you think them overturning segregation was ""legalizing equal rights"". You really seem to have little understanding of civics."
csjhidf,lolamp33,"I know civics are completely manipulated, and bullshit, to suit very specific agendas of very politically-leaned judgesand in TRUE libertarianism, segregation would be a perfectly admissible thing (as it once was, before it was defined), and libertarianism COULD be the direction where the country eventually goes - even if it is ""wrong"", and there are other whatever equal rights at playthe courts clearly dont have to mind any of those rules, because its all agenda first with them (then figuring out a way to shoehorn it so it works out on paper)"
csjhkcf,diefree85,There isn't an agenda this is just the correct interpretation with case history and precedence.
csjg0fn,Nurglings,"All of these decisions are upholding basic human rights, something that shouldn't be left wing or right wing."
csjgeoz,lolamp33,"I think its human right to deny people you dont want to serve business to, based on shallow reasons (ie, segregation)is that ""right"", whos determining that ""right"" - is this a left or right wing belief Im positing here?its easy to be biased with the times - and Im sure the supreme court does not always make decisions you would agree with, however they typically dont make such BIG decisions, for everybody else, like this (it calls for a pause to think about it)"

csjqxt3,TacticianRobin,"According to the Constitution, states are required to offer their citizens equal protection under the law. Since states are offering heterosexual couples special rights, privileges, tax breaks, ect. if they get married, they must also offer that opportunity to homosexual couples. This case doesn't set any precedents, if anything it reaffirms the precedent set in Loving v. Virginia."
csjs4nd,,If one vote had gone other way would you have said the system works? The judges wanted this to be true because they felt it was right so decided to implement it nationally despite having no solid constitutional basis (as you would see if you read the opinions)
csjtzrh,TacticianRobin,"I have read the opinions, and dissents. Have you read the 14th Amendment? If a state gives rights to some citizens it must give them to all citizens. Therefore if a state gives rights to straight married couples it must give those same rights to gay married couples. Period. Equal Protection Clause and Supremacy Clause guarantees this. Brush up on your Constitutional history so I don't have to explain this again, then we'll talk."
csjut6g,,"You don't understand what you are saying. If it was so clear there would not be 4 dissents here. Children can't be married, multiple people can't be married to the same person, there can't be group marriages, there can't be siblings get married, etc. all of these cases fit under your period. Statement. Do you think those are no doubt slam dunks as well to be allowed?"
csk0vf2,TacticianRobin,"Children aren't consenting adults (neither is your dog or your toaster before you try that move too), incest causes proven genetic problems (sometimes creating people who can't read!), polygamy is done for religious reasons (which separates it from civil marriage contracts). Please do your research before trying to argue this crap. All you're proving is that I can lead a man to the Constitution but I can't make him think."
csk1ub8,,so something should be illegal because of a few medical risks? you essentially provided no defense against polygamy. the exact same arguments for gay marriage can be used for those 2 (children is different I concede) and you refuse them. that tells me you are simply wanting what you think is right to be legal and don't care about laws
csjs2jm,cant-thinkofa-name,Well given the recent numbers show that most(around 65%) support Same sex marriage the vote wouldn't have changed the result.
csjswgl,,"It's not about the result though, it's about the process. Judges are supposed to judge whether something is within the law, not decide new law as they did here. The importance is we should be a nation of laws not a nation of men and their inclinations. That was a strong line from the dissent. If whole nation voted for gay marriage I have no problem letting that decide it"
csjt8ju,cant-thinkofa-name,Okay i get that in a way.
csjnehk,willswim4pizza,The real shame is how thoroughly and terribly the opposing point of view has been drowned out and slandered throughout this whole process.So many people here do not understand and do not want to understand the opposing viewpoint to this whole situation. Quite hypocritical and sad really.
csjnqnk,macaco_gordinho,"so because you religious belief says marriage is between a man and woman all people have to believe that? did marriage exist outside of your religious belief. Do all religions beleive what you do? This does not violate your religious belief. You are free to believe what you want. However, you don't get the right to impose your religious belief on those who do not agree with what you beleive."
csjnrno,willswim4pizza,THIS is exactly what I'm talking about. You have no clue what the opposing viewpoint is nor do you want to understand. You are completely ignorant.
csjnukn,macaco_gordinho,enlighten me on your viewpoint then
csjow67,willswim4pizza,"Hmm...where to start?I think the place to start is to point out that most people who are not in favor of gay marriage are not actually religious fanatics that oppose it for religious reasons. Most anti-gay rights people also want gays to be happy and do not have any problem with extending many (if not all) of the benefits of marriage to gay couples.But guess what? Marriage has been a very sacred and very core part of culture and civilization for thousands of years. Marriage is and always has been something between a man and a woman. Now, suddenly, a small minority group comes along and says that it is unjust if the majority does not change the laws of something sacred and traditional to accommodate their lifestyle?Why can't the gay marriage folks just request that the legal rights of marriage extend to a civil union (or some other name) to represent their union/marriage? This would have passed in flying colors long ago. But no. These folks INSIST that they take what is sacred to so many people and alter it to include them.That is the core of the problem regardless of what many (ignorant) people end up saying about religious beliefs and hate. This became a political issue that has become so inflamed that the truths are no longer evident.But now let's investigate the whole ""gay rights"" movement. The common notion is that allowing gays to marry is actually a civil rights movement and represents equal rights. That is patently false and is a full out lie perpetrated by those who know better but understand that branding their argument as such will get more people behind the movement. It worked. It does not make it true.This is not an equality issue because every single person (regardless of their sexual orientation) is allowed to marry under the law. No matter their color skin, no matter their IQ, no matter their religious beliefs. No matter anything. They can marry someone of the opposite sex. The issue we have here is that gays do not want to marry someone of the opposite sex. They DO have the same rights as everyone else protecting their right to do so. What gays want is to change the definition.Now, the only argument in favor of that theory is ""well, they can't help it. they were born that way."" That's a legitimate argument in favor of allowing them to enter into unions with one another for legal benefits. It is legitimately not their fault that they are attracted to someone of the same sex. However, the issue with that argument is that if they are born that way then there is clearly a medical issue causing it to be the case. Medical studies should be funded that are designed to figure out this medical ailment and potentially solve it. What if its found that lacking a certain hormone at a young age caused homosexuality? Far fetched, but something similar to that may be discovered. What if homosexuality could be prevented and medically fixed by an injection at a young age?The real issue is that you can't have it both ways. Homosexuality is abnormal. This is demonstrated through millions of years of evolution on our planet. So homosexuality is either an active choice or a physical/mental abnormality that may be avoidable in the future with advanced medical research and treatment. If it's not a choice then equal rights would dictate that people deserve the right to enter into a union with others of the same sex because they can't help how they are born and they can't help whom they love. If homosexuality is just a choice then why would we change the laws to accommodate people who are actively making a choice to refuse the current law just for their own personal pleasure?In order to get same sex marriage legalized, people want to say that homosexuality is not a choice and people cannot help themselves. They love who they love and its not their fault. But at the same time, nobody is allowed to point a finger and say ""hey maybe this is something that can be prevented in the future with some research and understanding."" Nobody wants to admit that homosexuality IS abnormal and quite realistically a disease or genetic defect. The current popular environment on this topic is toxic and hypocritical.Anyways, that touches on the core of the issues out there right now. Believe it or not, there is an actual argument against this. And it does make sense (whether or not I did it justice in my short explanation is entirely something else). People who do not want to alter the legal definition of marriage are not religious fanatics or cruel people who want to deny anyone equal rights or happiness. They just don't want to be bullied into changing thousands of years of culture by a minority group that quite literally wants to pretend that their way of life is the new normal."
csjpjcf,macaco_gordinho,"So your arguement boils down to ""Homosexuality is abnormal and a choice"" and therefore we shouldn't change the law. There is no scientific evidence that says homosexuality is a choice. If anything, homosexuality has been around for as long as humans have walked the earth for all we know. They also see homosexual tendencies in other species as well. Stating that ""Marriage has been a very sacred and very core part of culture and civilization for thousands of years"" and we shouldn't change the law because of that reason is not valid. The fact of the matter boils down to this.... Two men getting married or two women getting married, and using that term, will have no legal or personal effect on you. It doesn't mean you don't get to excercise that right, it just means that everyone can do the same."
csjpmuj,willswim4pizza,"What the fuck?! That was not my argument at all and it in no way, shape, or form ""boiled down to"" calling homosexuality a choice.Reading comprehension. It is important.Reread the first couple paragraphs. This has more to do with a small minority of people insisting that the majority change their definition of something that has been a core belief and foundation of their lives down their entire ancestry tree. People who strongly believe in marriage and have devoted their entire lives to the values of marriage are now being told that they must redefine marriage to include something else. In fact, they are being bullied by a minority group under the guise of equal rights (which is false, they already have the same rights as we do).Like I said, there would have NEVER been an argument and all of this would have been well behind everyone years ago if the gay community did not insist on changing the definition of marriage and instead wanted to merely extend the legal benefits of marriage to same sex unions. The gay community is not OK with that. They don't want to just get the legal benefits. They INSIST that it be called marriage and that people change what is sacred to them and their families into something else to include them."
csjqk5m,macaco_gordinho,"Just because something has always been a certain way doesn't mean it 's right.What is so wrong with two people wanting to be able to say the same thing you and I can say? Why can't they use the word marriage? How does that affect your life as you live it? Does it make your marriage less valued? Doesn't divorce devalue this sacred foundation you speak of?The truth is that it shouldn't matter that they call it marriage. It doesn't devalue you as a human being, a person, an individual. And you are mislead on that all gay people had the same rights as you and I under the law of ""civil unions"". You should fact check and do some ""comprehenisve reading yourself. And by the way, your comments about homosexuality are without base and lack merit. You have no evidence to which to support your claims."
csjqqhh,willswim4pizza,"Support what claims? What claims do you object to?>The truth is that it shouldn't matter that they call it marriage. It doesn't devalue you as a human being, a person, an individual. That's a fair argument. But there is also a counterargument to it. That's how this discussion should work. The sad reality of how this situation has been evolving is that untruths are perpetrated and one side has been slandered to the point where their argument is drowned out entirely and a lot of uneducated people are walking around preaching about equal rights. This is not an equal rights issue. Gays are allowed the same rights as straights; to marry someone of the opposite sex. They are being treated 100% equally. They just want something different and are demanding the law be changed to accommodate them. Fair enough, but don't call it equal rights and pretend that your side is persecuted and/or treated unjustly."
csjr1b7,macaco_gordinho,It is equal to say you can have something but you have to call it something else?
csjraoh,willswim4pizza,"You are misunderstanding. EVERYONE can get married. Therefor EVERYONE has equal rights. The restriction of marriage being between a man and a woman applies to EVERYONE equally. Therefor everyone has the same rights.It is not an equal rights issue. Homosexuals want something new to accommodate their lifestyle preference.For example, I am a straight male. Until gay marriage passed, I could not marry my roommate (another male). Why would I want to even do that? Because we both want tax breaks! It was not legal though so we couldn't do it. Neither could two gay men who were in love. Why not? Because the law was equally applied to everyone. We all had the same rights.Unequal rights would have been allowing my roommate and I to marry when we were straight males, but refusing to allow two gay men to marry. This was never the case."
csjrkj0,macaco_gordinho,"if EVERYONE could get married, then why is there a case in front of SCOTUS? There wouldn't be a case. States have laws that make same sex marriages or civil unions (whatever your non belief is) ILLEGAL!!!! Thats the whole point of this case. Tax breaks? You and your wife get tax breaks but somone and their significant other man or woman can't. How is that equal? You can do something under the law that you have determined is only for certain people a certain way. You make the case that heterosexuals are the only people in the world. Homosexuals have the right to choose who they want to marry. Get over it."
csjru75,willswim4pizza,"Are you intentionally ignoring what I'm saying or just obtuse?I mean seriously. I'm ""over it"" already. I don't really care too much. I am just annoyed that people like you refuse to accept the legitimate argument that my side has. You don't even acknowledge it and you continue to push your bullshit lies down our throats.Why do gays have to be such dicks that they force everyone to change their definition of marriage to fit their lifestyle? Just lobby to have civil unions provide the same medical and tax benefits and nobody would give a shit."
csjs3pm,macaco_gordinho,Im not ignoring you. Who says that people who arent gay get to define marriage? Why do you get to call it something but the SAME EXACT THING HAS TO BE CALLED SOMETHING DIFFERENT. Arguing that makes you obtuse.
csjng9q,m5726,Its funny because liberals call themselves the group of 'tolerance' too

csjok17,Axel927,"A slippery slope? No. Historically, the Supreme Court has used the 14th Amendment as a means to expand civil rights, under the due process and equal protection clauses. This case (*Obergefell*) falls under due process. So did *Lawrence v. Texas*, *Roe v. Wade*, and *Griswold v. Connecticut.*Generally, states have been not all that great at protecting the rights of the minority, and it's been the role of the Supreme Court to step in and say, ""No. These people are citizens of the United States, and are entitled to the same rights as anyone else."" That's one of the reasons I've never really been in favor of letting people vote on matters of gay marriage. In what world does it make sense for people to vote on the rights of others?"
csjoexm,macaco_gordinho,"I think the problem lies with the fact that these laws violated equal rights for all people under the law.

In some parts of the country if you don't look white you can be legally harassed for papers, many hispanic people are assumed to be illegal even if they are or aren't they still get treated like dirt.The Civil Rights Movement for racial minorities started a long time ago, yet we still haven't progressed much. The discrimination homosexuals receive is incomparable to the amount of hate racial minorities receive considering the amount of abuse and even death for just being non-white.So don't take this success lightly, considering people are still getting killed for being non-white. Yet this country hardly wants to address issues like gun control, or police brutality.I'm just kind of confused considering how a large reason why public opinion did a 360 of homosexuals change was from people relating their struggle to racial minorities, yet racial minorities are interestingly enough more persecuted & disrespected in this country."

I don't actually care. I know for a fact that same-sex marriage is not a logical extension of biracial marriage. Marriage, as defined by the religious institutions that created it, is exclusive vaginal intercourse. It's not about excluding a group of people. Gay people cannot be married. It's simply not physically possible. A castrated man cannot be married. That's not because I'm bigotted against men who have been castrated. It's just not physically possible.I understand that governments offer legal benefits to married people, but changing the definition of marriage to grant these benefits to unmarried people is not a good solution for providing benefits to people in a same-sex relationship.

You might as well given me a soup recipe up there.The train has long left the station on the government-conferred benefits of marriage. A world without said involvement would mean more laborious tax returns, banking issues, no spousal privilege in court, a patchwork of power of attorney and other agreements and innumerable other hindrances. Every bit of family law and case law at the state and federal level was designed for MARRIAGE. They can't just go into the federal register with white out and a pen."
cskoahf,,"> Marriage as a civil act has nothing to do with religion except in that a religious officiant may perform the ceremony.The church has been performing marriages thousands of years before any state. The reason for this is because it is a religious ceremony. You keep saying it is a civil act, but it has only been made a civil act relatively recently, in violation of the separation of church and state. This is not an opinion. It is a fact of history.> The train has long left the station on the government-conferred benefits of marriage.This is called being close-minded.> A world without said involvement would mean more laborious tax returns, banking issues, no spousal privilege in court, a patchwork of power of attorney and other agreements and innumerable other hindrances.How would government exclusively issuing civil unions, and not marriage liscenses, cause all of these problems? It wouldn't. You just cannot admit that it would solve the problem because you're simply more interested in being right than solving problems."
cskolwf,aresef,"There are Catholic schools, but also public schools. They are both schools. So I don't really see the point. Religious people do not have a monopoly on marriage. My wife and I are atheists. We got married. We have no problem calling it marriage.And then, if you bring religion into it, which religion do we go by when determining what is a valid marriage? If we go by the Catholic doctrine, would everyone require annulment of prior marriages? Would we go by the Baha'i faith and require permission from all living parents? Can a man take up to four wives as Islam allows? Fortunately, in this country, the church and state are constitutionally separate and government doesn't have to care, necessarily, about what the Pope thinks, what the Archbishop of Canterbury thinks, what any religious figurehead thinks. Why does it matter to you so much what secular unions are called?"
cskp47a,,"> Religious people do not have a monopoly on marriage.Marriage is just as much a religious ceremony as baptism.> My wife and I are atheists. We got married. We have no problem calling it marriage.I don't really care about your opinions or attitudes towards marriage. Opinions are not relevant to this discussion.What's relevant is that marriage is a religious ceremony and then other, nonreligious entity, came later and adopted the tradition and name. Now that other entity has changed the meaning of that tradition to such an extent that it doesn't even resemble what it was originally. This isn't an opinion. This is a fact.My proposition is to give religion the exclusive use of the term marriage, as it was thousands of years ago. The state would then have the exclusive use of the term civil union which it can apply any definition it chooses, and change that definition on a whim because it would not have an impact on any religions. If you believe in the separation of church and state, then this is the only correct view. Assuming that you do believe in the separation of church and state, I don't know what your problem is.> And then, if you bring religion into it, which religion do we go by when determining what is a valid marriage?Each religion can determine that for itself. The government would have no concern on the matter. To get legal benefits, you need to apply for a civil union regardless of marital status from any respective religion.> Why does it matter to you so much what secular unions are called?I care what secular unions are called because secular unions are changing the definition of a term coined by religious institutions. Why do you care what secular unions are called? If religious people want to keep marriage as between a man and a woman, why dont you just change the name of secular unions to something else and then religious people can keep their traditional definition of marriage, as that term will be exclusively used by their respective religion?What is your problem with that?"
cskpedw,aresef,"I do believe in church and state, but let's go back to my school analogy. European schooling sprang from the monasteries of the Roman Catholic Church. These monastic schools spread across Europe. Should the government then let only Catholic schools call themselves schools and change all the public schools in America to, oh, learning facilities? Hell no. That's absurd.Institutions, be they schools or marriage, change over time. Justice Kennedy put it better than I ever could.>The ancient origins of marriage confirm its centrality, but it has not stood in isolation from developments in law and society. The history of marriage is one of both continuity and change. That institution—even as confined to opposite-sex relations—has evolved over time.>For example, marriage was once viewed as an arrangement by the couple's parents based on political, religious, and financial concerns; but by the time of the Nation's founding it was understood to be a voluntary contract between a man and a woman. See N. Cott, Public Vows: A History of Marriage and the Nation 9–17 (2000); S. Coontz, Marriage, A History 15–16 (2005).->The nature of injustice is that we may not always see it in our own times. The generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions, and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning. When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution's central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed.>In Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1, 12 (1967), which invalidated bans on interracial unions, a unanimous Court held marriage is “one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.” The Court reaffirmed that holding in Zablocki v. Redhail, 434 U. S. 374, 384 (1978), which held the right to marry was burdened by a law prohibiting fathers who were behind on child support from marrying. The Court again applied this principle in Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 95 (1987), which held the right to marry was abridged by regulations limiting the privilege of prison inmates to marry. Over time and in other contexts, the Court has reiterated that the right to marry is fundamental under the Due Process Clause."
cskpye1,,"School is not religious. Just because some schools are affiliated with religions doesn't make them religious in nature. Schools are not mentioned in any religious texts, for example. It is simply not relevant, and no church is interested in preserving some definition of schooling.How marriages were arranged is not relevant either. By no definition of marriage does it state that marriage must be arranged by parents. That is cultural.What the ceremony looks like is also cultural.The fact that marriage is sex between a man and a woman is not cultural. It is the core of what marriage is.Justice Kennedy has an agenda, but his justification for his beliefs is seriously flawed."
cskqdkt,aresef,"What Kennedy's agenda was or wasn't doesn't matter. He's a Supreme Court justice. He did his job. He based his opinion (which four colleagues joined) on precedent. Precedent says marriage is a fundamental right, not just Loving and Windsor, but a host of other high court decisions over the years. If you want to see an emotion-driven agenda, read Scalia's unhinged dissent.Marriage also has nothing to do with sex or procreation. We don't burst down doors at senior living complexes with divorce papers. We don't ask couples getting married if their parts are working. Marriage has nothing to do with a ceremony. Marriage doesn't even have anything to do with gender. Marriage has everything to do with love, security, dignity and commitment. You would seek to deny couples that.I'm done here."

I've already addressed this. The tradition definition of marriage does not withhold any person from the right to marriage. Race and sexual orientation have NOTHING to do with marriage. A gay man has the right to marry any woman he chooses and consents to the marriage, just like straight men. What a man happens to desire, sexually, is not relevant to this discussion.> Marriage also has nothing to do with sexMarriage is sex. You don't know what you're talking about.> Marriage has everything to do with love, security, dignity and commitment. You would seek to deny couples that.This is a strawman.

cskr5iz,aresef,"I said I was done because you're being outrageously hateful, but it seems like things need clarifying here.His justification was based in precedent. If you can find me cases that say he made the wrong ruling, let me know. The ""traditional definition"" doesn't matter. Institutions like marriage evolve. They are not static. In 1967, the court struck down miscegenation laws. In Lawrence v. Texas, the court struck down sodomy laws. Society evolves, and with it, the court. Plessy v. Ferguson and Dred Scott were rulings made at very different points in history from Brown v. Board of Education. SCOTUS had compelling evidence to revisit Plessy and they overturned it.Marriage still has nothing to do with sex. Neither the act nor the physical characteristics. We do not ask married couples if they plan to bone immediately or on their honeymoon. We do not require that couples reproduce. No marriage vows, religious or secular, that I'm aware of even mention sexual acts. They're all about having and holding, richer or poorer, sickness and health. The only state entry into the bedroom is in 21 states where adultery remains a crime, but that's seldom enforced.I haven't lied once. You're the one distorting. Later days, friend. I hope you see the light someday."

Instead, they say that the issue as to who can get married should be decided completely free of any government entity and instead by - gasp! - the individual people involved. Imagine that?

This is the land of the free but if we are to try and stick to our past like our ancestors and founding fathers wanted I think they would be sadly disappointed. What is happening in America now is repeating history. A lot of what happened in the downfall of Rome which is described in the Bible which Paul writes letters To churches to warn them to straighten up. I think that text can compare to present day. We are afraid to step on people's toes. I believe in freedom but not freedom to the extent of when you can complain you get what you want. I also know some people that are gay or struggle with it and that's fine I'm not going to be mean to you I will accept you and hope I can help in anyway. I believe in peace but I also believe in sanding my ground.

csjmrf1,macaco_gordinho,Well I guess it depends what the law is for incest. I mean can a man and woman legally marry if they are related? What changes because the same sex can now marry?
csjnbr1,rusttard,"The final two paragraphs of the Court's opinion:No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.section 1 of 14th amendment which was used in ruling:Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws**so im just curious since citizens are citizens no matter what and are all entitled to the same rights/privileges, are the incestuous being discriminated against because we think its ""wrong""?**edit: the bold font"

It's not crunching numbers, it means when your partner needs to make a medical decision on your behalf (when you are unconscious, for example) they *can*."
csjzy0h,C0demunkee,"Also something that can be done with a generic ""person 1"" ""person 2"" form. Marriage need not play a part."

csk3nu6,C0demunkee,"Why? This can be a Beneficiary #1, emergency contact #2 etc."
csk4025,radialomens,"Why what? Why would it take many forms? Because we don't have a one-size-fits-all legal department in the statehouse. Or even jack-of-all-trades lawyers. Military benefits would have to be approved by the military. Inheritance would likely be an estate lawyer. Filing for joint adoption would likely take an adoption attorney. Gaining partial custody of your SO's child will be a family attorney.Why does it take fees? Lawyers aren't free.Why would insurance still be out of reach? Employers aren't obligated to extend insurance to non-spouses. They don't even *have* to extend insurance to spouses. And they probably aren't going to change because they don't want unmarried employees tacking on their buddies to company insurance when it's intended to support families. There are other benefits, too. Tuition discounts and scholarships that are only for married students. Obtaining residency and citizenship for an SO from outside of the country. Being able to file a wrongful death suit if your SO is killed in an accident. Being allowed to take time off work to care for a sick, injured or dead SO.

csjgs29,ItsMeTK,"Once again, it all comes down to the 14th Amendment, the worst, most hastily written Amendment to our Constitution and the source of many of our current troubles. Abortion was legalized under the 14th Amendment. Under the 14th Amendment we got the ""anchor baby"" phenomenon, which has muddied immigration issues. And now this gay marriage argument. The real issue is not whether or not gay marriage is good or bad for America or in general. The issue is the sovereignty of states in this union.The 14th Amendment was rushed out to grant rights to the freed slave population after the Civil War. But the damage it has done since then continues to this day, as nearly any case of ""rights"" can find justification in the vague wording of the 14th Amendment's ""due process clause"". There's really no other Constitutional justification. I'm certainly not saying civilization will end because of this ruling, but it's part of a larger problem in this country where so many landmark decisions are made based on this one tiny clause never intended to do the things its been used to do.So rather than rail agains gay marriage or fight to overturn abortion, etc., I think this country would be better off with a new amendment to abolish and/or rewrite the 14th. It's caused enough problems."
csjhg19,Alpha-Q,"Well, if we're going that far, I think the source of all the troubles is not the 14th Amendment but bringing slaves in the first place. OR even earlier, driving the natives out, committing genocide and then breaking the treaties with the natives. As for ""anchor babies"" maybe the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas had something to do with the root cause too."
csjh1n4,harpgoer,"Okay, I seem to be the only conservative at this party. I'm fine with this in a sense. But I don't get the idea of marriage being so loosely defined.Is the idea that people who want the rights and obligations of legal marriage (one of those being sexual intercourse) should be able to marry regardless of gender? If so, why not allow marriage between any number of people and not just two? I could see this being problematic in two areas. One being divorce. What if partner A wanted to divorce partner B but not partner C? But partner C did not want to divorce partner B. Where would you go with that? The other being conjugal rights as this is a grounds for divorce. What if all partners did not want to have or offer conjugal rights to all other partners? Would that be defined in the marriage certificate?But if those issues could be solved, why limit marriage at all?"

csjnzal,redy4downvotetsunami,"May get downvoted, will say this anyway:Gay marriage doesn't matter (unless you're gay and want to get married). The problems associated with (male) homosexuality don't come from marriage. They come from mass gay male promiscuity, spreading diseases, and some male gays who are sexual predators and rapists. Consensual marriage between gays won't increase gay promiscuity and probably won't increase gay rapists/molesters. So I don't see the harm. As for sanctity of marriage, that's been fucked up a long time ago. Men and women cheat on their spouses, get divorced, some men married to women are closet homosexuals (who probably oppose legal gay marriage cause their bf's will pressure them to divorce wife and marry them), some people only marry for money, some practice polygamy- the list can go on."

csk1kal,SequorScientia,"> Oh, so we should just ignore atrocities because they aren't happening here? Who said we have to ignore the atrocities, and who said that we have to address them one at a time? If you care about them so much, get up off your ass and be more than an armchair activist. What have you done lately besides point out something completely trite and uninteresting? Different issues matter to different people in different ways, and people will fight for what they think is important. If those other issues are so important to you, then start blowing up your own facebook wall for a change. Join an activist group. Donate money. Go overseas and help. Do something other than whine on the internet for christ's sake. >morals in this country have gone to shitActually, they have been getting better and better. No more slavery here, disenfranchisement of women, legal racism, and now, we recognize gays as equals under the law with regards to marriage. You have *no* idea what you're talking about. >which changes nothing since they were already doing whatever they wanted to.If you really believe this changes nothing, then you are a fool. Go tell the LGBT community in Russia or Saudi Arabia, where you can be killed for being a homosexual, that this is all meaningless and unimportant drivel. Until you do any of the aforementioned, you're just holding an empty sack."
csk30be,benmaney1,"No, the morals in this country have definitely gone to shit. Just because you have no morals and the things you are pushing for are happening doesn't mean the country has morals. Also, I thought we didn't care about what happened in different countries, so why do we care about the gays in Russia and Saudi Arabia all of a sudden?

I'm actually punching babies and selling grass to minors as we speak. >Also, I thought we didn't care about what happened in different countriesWhen did I say that? Find for me in my comments where I said anything even remotely close to that. Don't worry, I'll wait. >Way to prove that you don't care about innocents getting murdered unless they are a group that fits into your pathetic agenda.How can you accuse me for not caring about innocent people getting murdered in other countries who aren't gay? Again, find for me in my comments where I even *implied* that. All I said was that there are hundreds of issues going on currently in the world today, and because one person cannot possibly focus on all of them, he/she will have to pick a select few that they think are important, and focus their attention on them for a given amount of time. In no way does that mean I have no empathy for the misfortunes of others. Drawing a completely unrelated conclusion from a premise is called a ""non-sequitur"", look it up. Nobody has the time/energy/resources to focus on every single issue. And it's quite ironic that you'll accuse me of not caring about things that *you* think are important, while simultaneously accusing me of the same thing. Arguing in that manner just makes you sound like a whiner, which you are. It also makes you look like a fool, which you are. Anyhow, you haven't even tried to persuade me that you've done anything for anybody else in the world, whether it was overseas or at home, so I can only conclude that you just like to talk shit from your armchair to people on the internet with a smug sense of self-righteousness because it gets you off to feel like you did something good in the world. But actions speak louder than words, and you're a fucking mute to me."
cskg740,benmaney1,"It is your opinion that morals have not gone to shit and it is mine that they have, how do you not get that?

Do you have short term memory loss or something?"
cskgctb,SequorScientia,"> It is your opinion that morals have not gone to shit and it is mine that they have, how do you not get that?Having different opinions does not mean that both are equally valid.

csjwzed,SequorScientia,"Reducing marriage equality for the LGBT as just a win for the business that can potentially profit off of them is incredibly pessimistic.

But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children. I would rather not go free.' If he does this, his master must present him before God.

'Some people want to do it' is a pretty bad reason to go legalising anything and everything, you should have an actual legal foundation for such.>nothing in the constitution that can be used to ban them from doing soAnd nothing saying they can. But there were restrictons in many states' laws, which your SCOTUS chose to ignore, instead deciding to legislate from the bench which they're historically notorious for. Thank god our High Court doesn't usually pull such shit."
csjg2d4,mattsauer,"ok, so just to be clear gay marriage is on the same level as robbing jewelry stores and raping children to you? this is about personal freedom and the pursuit of happiness, not breaking established laws that protect society.normally, i'd agree with you that states should have more power to legislate than the federal government. however not in this particular case. no one should deny the right to marriage, should any two consenting adults want to take the leap."
csjg8fz,SlimePrime,">ok, so just to be clear gay marriage is on the same level as robbing jewelry stores and raping children to you?Do pay attention to the sentence that followed: ""'Some people want to do it' is a pretty bad reason to go legalising anything and everything, you should have an actual legal foundation for such.""'Some people want it' is not an argument that should be used in court/legal interpretation.

csk3q9t,SlimePrime,">It's not discrimination, they're all being treated equallyAgreed, hence why such laws should have been found constitutional also. But instead of waiting for legislation to change, which would be the proper way to bring about change, SCOTUS decided to legislate from the bench instead. Because why be a proper judge when you have unchecked power and can get away with twisting the law to your will?"
csjfkhz,Mongfight,"Marriage isn't defined, but equal access to public institutions is. It's that simple. Marriage is a public institution. The government issues marriage certificates. if you can't understand this basic principle, take a U.S. Civics class and we can discuss"
csjfpwd,SlimePrime,">equal access to public institutions is. It's that simpleAgreed. And since all enjoyed the exact same rights, the ability to marry one person of the opposite gender, it wasn't really a question of such. But again, the law can often be twisted by judges more interested in legislating from the bench based on their feels than actual interpretation, seems to be a bit of a problem with SCOTUS, hope the trend doesn't spread down here."
csjezqk,Dusty_Ideas,"You lost, more people get to enjoy marriage.Cry more about happiness this brings millions of people."
csjf5kr,SlimePrime,">You lostm8y, I'm not even an Amerifat. But in any case doing just fine down here, our marriage laws still respect traditional marriage thankfully. :)"
csjfz3x,diefree85,"Oh so you own your wives and have concubines? Force women to marry their rapist? All these things brought to you by ""traditional marriage"". Thank you for proving we can ignore your opinion."
csjg5zj,SlimePrime,"You seem somewhat confused, traditional =/= pure biblical, but thanks for playing."
csjg9ao,diefree85,Then you don't use the traditional marriage. So you admit you're a hypocrite. Thanks for playing.
csjgbb6,SlimePrime,">Then you don't use the traditional marriageProtip: 'Traditional' is not a hard synonym for 'biblical'. Some might interpret it as such sure, but that's not how words work."
csjgjub,diefree85,"Marriage, the earliest marriage, was a transfer of property. Simple fact. So do you believe women are property or are you admitting you're a hypocrite?"
csjgwl3,SlimePrime,">Marriage, the earliest marriage, was a transfer of property.The earliest marriage definitely has no written record, so if you have some magic means of determining such would like to see it.But in any case traditional is also not a hard synonym for 'earliest on record'. Please do consult a dictionary and grammar guide at some point."
csjh3k9,diefree85,You're saying traditional but then yours wouldn't be that either since it's changed.http://www.livescience.com/37777-history-of-marriage.htmlKeep showing your ignorance it's funny slapping your idiocy down repeatedly.
csjhhx3,SlimePrime,"This really is getting adorable. If you don't understand the simple meaning of words debate is quite difficult. From your continuous typos and poor grammar I'm going to assume you're ESL, so I'll try and explain in easier terms.This word you're having difficulties with 'traditional', doesn't have to mean 'oldest on record' or 'ancient'. For example, the first dictionary on google gives one definition as *'a customary or characteristic method or manner'*. Customary or characteristic doesn't require one to go back to the beginning of time. Something that's been continuing for say 20 years can be seen as customary or characteristic of whatever it relates to. Easy right?Hope this helps, I know learning a new language can be tough."
csjhrhi,diefree85,"Thanks for proving you have nothing. The only reason you're attacking my typos is because you literally have nothing left to argue. You say traditional well I established you're using a different version than true traditional. Unless you think women are inferior to men. So are you going to admit that or admit you're a hypocrite? If you want to use the traditional argument then you don't get to say yours is the right one as it is changed from the older ones.Then you also thing interracial marriage bans should not have been struck down? Since the ""customary"" marriage before that was same race. Good thing is the 14th amendment determines marriage is a right. This is simple fact. Good luck on living in ignorance. I've proven you're just a loudmouthed bigot so I'm done with you."
csji1la,SlimePrime,">attacking my typosNo need to be so defensive, never criticised you for them, though they do seem to be evidence of your less than superb grasp of the English language. Trying to help you here matey.>You say traditional well I established you're using a different version than true traditional.Oh you established it did you? I must have missed all those citations explaining that the word traditional no longer means what the dictionary claims it does.>If you want to use the traditional argument then you don't get to say yours is the right one as it is changed from the older ones.What kind of world of absolutes do you live in? One can support what today is generally referred to as 'traditional marriage' without needing to support a 100% biblical interpretation since they *needn't refer to the same thing*, which seems to be where you're having some trouble in the comprehension department.May as well say one can't support living an eco-friendly lifestyle unless they go full native and live a hunter gather lifestyle in the rainforest.>Then you also thing interracial marriage bans should not have been struck down?They should have been legislated out. It's not the job of a court to redefine the law when its meaning is clear and legally valid. Again for the third or so time it's not a question of whether you support it one way or the other, it's just how most western legal systems work. The court is not meant to legislate, the *legislature* has a reason for existence you realise.I really hope for your sake your reading comprehension skills improve or you're going to have a difficult life. And good luck adding something beyond petty insults to your list of debate tactics."
csjfxb9,diefree85,"So your country is ran by mostly bigots. We have the 14th amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law. So maybe you'd like to join us in the 21st century champ."
csjg3qu,SlimePrime,">which guarantees equal protection under the lawAnd since all had the exact same rights, to marry one person of the opposite gender, they did.Hey I'm sure a superior court that legislates from the bench based on personal emotion instead of hard law is great when they do so in line with your worldview, but that's not always guaranteed to be the case. Not a great thing in the long run honestly.>So your country is ran by mostly bigotsThat's right m8, anyone with an opinion differing from your own is a bigot. ;)"
csjg86e,diefree85,"No you're a bigot because you're arguing your fellow citizens are less human than you and deserve let's rights. I'll simplify it so even you can understand champ.""""And since they had the same rights, to marry a person of the same race, they did""See how stupid you sound now?"
csjgf85,SlimePrime,">""And since they had the same rights, to marry a person of the same race, they did""Which at the time they did, hence why such an argument should not be used to have overturned such either. Change would require legislation in such a case.The thing you don't seem to comprehend is that legal interpretation is not a feels-based science. I do pity the American system though when 5/4 of your Justices fail to see that as well in the pursuit of trying to make a legacy for themselves or whatever they're doing.>deserve let's rightsFor some reason couldn't help laughing at this though, thanks for the Engrish, made this conversation worthwhile."
csjgiqm,diefree85,Oh no a typo. Just run along champ. You bigots lost facts and the right side finally won. So unless you are going to say interracial marriage should be banned we can see you're a hypocrite.
csjgt02,SlimePrime,">Oh no a typoActually a grammatical error. I'm not judging though, it was genuinely entertaining. But if you want to take it as an insult that's your prerogative.>So unless you are going to say interracial marriage should be banned we can see you're a hypocrite.You're not very good at reading comprehension I see so let me spell it out. It's not a question of being for or against anything, it's a question of how courts are supposed to function. Bending the law to breaking point to make one's opinion law is not the job of a judge. Changing the law based on public sentiment is the sole duty of the legislature, all the court should ever do is interpret the legislature's law and will as accurately as possible.Your SCOTUS however has a long history of legislating from the bench even when the law is quite clear, in order to either protect their legacy, please the POTUS who put them in charge, or align the law with what they think is public sentiment. It's really not how a court should be run, and thankfully we don't have too much of that shit down here.So go celebrate all you want, which way America rolls is their business. I just pity the states whose will is being ignored and laws trampled based not on logic and law, but the feels of five justices. Though again I really hope this legislating from the bench fad doesn't catch on here."
csjgxox,diefree85,"You really are just a loud mouth fool who doesn't understand a damn thing about America. I'll make it simple. In the 60's marriage was determined to fall under the 14th amendment. The SCOTUS just upheld that. Yea you just keep a second class citizens. The SCOTUS used the law and ruled correctly. Now just run along it's clear you're the one working of ""feels"" and not logic."
csjh0nv,SlimePrime,">In the 60's marriage was determined to fall under the 14th amendmentAs I said, *a long history*. Again SCOTUS legislating from the bench is not a new phenomenon.>Yea you just keep a second class citizensSecond class citizens with the exact same rights, my sides.>Now just run along it's clear you're the one working of ""feels"" and not logic. Seriously though get that grammar guide soon."
csjh91u,diefree85,Do they have the right to marry a partner of their choosing? No they don't. You're the one that needs the dictionary champ. So you're also against the overturning on bans on interracial marriage too. So are you ready to admit you're a hypocrite?
csjhkki,SlimePrime,">Do they have the right to marry a partner of their choosing?Do I have the right to rob any item I want? No.Laws do not work based on wants. You should be careful if you ever try to use that as a defence if arrested.>So you're also against the overturning on bans on interracial marriage tooSince this is the exact same thing you've already asked, allow me to provide the exact same answer yet again:>It's not a question of being for or against anything, it's a question of how courts are supposed to function.

csk29ip,ArturoWallander,"It ain't about y'all, man. It's about love, plain and simple."
csk2g6o,radialomens,">Seeing as marriage is something that was born entirely out of religionThat's not a fact. The origin of marriage isn't ""entirely"" from any one source or for any one reason. Marriage doesn't belong to religion.Besides, atheists get married all the time. And why would someone want to get married, you ask? Veterans benefits, disability benefits, inheritance (without hiring a lawyer specifically for the task), the ability to take leave from work to care for a sick spouse, receiving workers compensation for an injured or killed spouse, being allowed take leave from work if your spouse dies, being able to visit your spouse in intensive care or during restricted visiting hours, being able to make arrangements after your spouse's death, filing for joint adoption or foster care rights, receiving visitation or child support if you divorce, receiving family rates for insurance, receiving tuition discounts, being able to sue a person for the wrongful death of your spouse, obtaining immigration or residency benefits, and being able to visit your spouse in prison.Plus that whole equality thing."
cskeqqi,paleoconn,"Good answer. I never thought about those other things. I do have some gay friends who would do it purely out if spite, because they were raised in overly Christian households, and that's why I asked. I don't agree with them."
csk2g9g,SequorScientia,"Marriage in the United States has very little to do with religion. You don't need to step foot into a church or any other religious institution in order to be married. Your marriage just needs to be performed by somebody with the authority to file your marriage certificate at the local county office, and that's it. Marriage ceremonies are just a superfluous tradition that celebrates a marriage, and are entirely unnecessary. And marriage was not born out of religion. It was created as a way to pass on material wealth from generation to generation. It was confiscated by religious institutions thereafter."

Religious marriages are actually in the minority; the vast majority of cultures have marriage practices that predate organized religion and had little to no religious component. The primary purpose of marriage is and always has been defining a family unit for things like inheritance, cohabitation, shared property, and divided labor.

He could never do this, because it is a grave sin in His Eyes.How dare these people think it is acceptable to parade this abominable act in My Father's churches?Children, I love every soul.I love sinners.I detest their sin, but love the sinner.Same sex sexual acts are not acceptable in My Father's Eyes.Pray for these souls because I love them, but cannot give them the Graces they desire.They must know, that no matter how much they try to condone same sex marriages, they are not entitled to participate in the Holy Sacrament of Marriage.A Sacrament must come from God. The Rules for receiving Sacraments must stem from My Father's Teachings.You cannot force My Father, God the Most High, to give His blessing, or access to, His Holy Sacraments, unless they are respected in the way they are meant to be.Sin is now presented in the world as a good thing.As I have said before the world is back to front.Good is presented as evil and those people who try to live by the Laws of God the Father, are sneered at.**Evil, no matter how you dress it up, cannot be turned into an act of goodness, in the Eyes of My Father.**My Father will punish those who continue to flaunt their sins before Him.Heed this warning, for your sins, which are carried out when you refuse to obey God, will not and cannot be forgiven.This is because you refuse to accept sin for what it is.**Your Saviour****Jesus Christ**"

csjt0wb,absynthe7,You seem to be confused about what this ruling entails. [Here's a handy chart that should clarify things.](http://www.balloon-juice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tWa05UHzPgi588jtC0Fn4ePdo1_500.jpg)
csjtm6m,radialomens,"In the coming months the economy will see a flood of spending as same-sex couples and their families pay for venues, caterers, cakes, dresses, suits, bands, flowers, etc. Same-sex couples will not be denied insurance on family plans and will be eligible to receive death benefits if their SO passes, making it harder for tragedy to throw them into destitution. When does the downfall come in?"

cskm7l1,radialomens,"Arguments of nature are useless. You know what else isn't intended by nature? Piercing ears, shaving beards, dying hair, circumcising babies, tattooing skin, c-sections, heart transplants, blood donations, antibiotics, and more. Nature never intended for men packed into a metal tube to sustain flight at 30,000 feet. Nature never intended for people to make up for their poor vision with curved, glass lenses. Nature never intended for people with diabetes, leukemia or downs syndrome to survive. *We, as a society, do not bow to meet a natural state*. There is no law imposed on us to limit ourselves to ""natural"" acts.You know what is natural? Your inevitable death, and the death of your ancient ideas."

csjsj9p,drinkandroll,Mass degeneracy is just another sign that this country is circling the drain.
csjsmgw,,"Oh, yes, because two people in a committed relationship having their union recognized under the law totally screams degeneracy."
csk1t8l,drinkandroll,"I could give a shit if two homosexuals are in a committed relationship but what has been defined as marriage for over 10,000 years isn't going to change just because this nation has gone degenerate in the last 30 years."
csk1zk0,,"Well, you may not like it but you don't get to define marriage and times have changed. Don't like it, don't have a same sex marriage. This has no impact on you."
cskw30o,drinkandroll,"Do you think that our ancestors who founded this country wanted this? Or that our grandfathers who died on Omaha beach wanted mass degeneracy? This is yet another sign that this country is circling the fucking drain. The system was collapsing long before yesterday and the mass economic, political, and moral corruption will lead to a mass reset as it always has. No empire lasts forever, and the USA is at it's end of days."
cskwcfp,,"Did you know that gay people existed during World War II? And that they died at Omaha Beach too? And that they helped build this country? They died for you to be able to say what you're saying right now. People have always thought radical social change was proof that the country was circling the drain, but we're still chugging along. Is everything perfect? No, but this isn't going to kill us. You don't like it? Fine, don't marry a gay person. But you cannot stop the wheel of progress from moving. You can move yourself, I hear Russia is pretty nice for people who think like you. Otherwise, just keep complaining, I guess. It's your right to do so."
ct6uymz,drinkandroll,"you are a degenerate that represents less than 2% of the population. You exist here because people like me protect you from getting exterminated like they do over in the middle east. Be a degenerate, but don't ask your protectors to play along with this fake marriage bullshit or maybe we will just stop protecting you."
ct6wj64,,"I'm a heterosexual married woman, pretty sure we represent more than 2%. Oddly enough, people can support the rights of others without actually being members of those groups.You don't protect shit and even if you did, I wouldn't want someone like you doing a single thing for me. Grow up and stop being an asshole to random people on the internet. You're not doing anything but making yourself seem like a bigoted, pathetic piece of shit."
cte3ft6,drinkandroll,bullshit. you are weak. You have no means to defend yourself in real life other than bitching and whining. You probably don't even own a gun.
cte4108,,"Oh, shut up, little boy. Go bother someone else."
csjsm0j,aresef,But we took a step back to sensibility with today's ruling. Great day to be an American.
csk28kn,drinkandroll,"This country is rapidly decaying economically, politically, and socially. The economy is based on an unsustainable system of debt controlled by the bankers, there is massive federal government overreach and growth, and a 10,000+ year definition of marriage has been corrupted. Rome wasn't built in a day, and it didn't fall in a day, and this country is in decline."
csk33dw,aresef,"Nothing was corrupted today except hate. Love won the day. The next fight is for full equality of legally married couples in all respects, from asshole court clerks to wedding cakes."
cskuyla,drinkandroll,Bullshit. You didn't even respond to my points. This is degeneracy.
cskvnrj,aresef,Degeneracy is a value judgment. The ruling strengthened families and put us a step closer to having fewer people treated as second class citizens under the law.
csjy9e5,ranman1124,"Everything is a right now, I want to marry a dog and 15 year old, its my right, I am being discriminated against damnit!"

csjysq2,ranman1124,"Ok, where do we draw the line then? The minute you draw a line, you are discriminating against someone, yes or no? Equal protection for everyone right?"
csjz05j,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"Rights come before harm. Marrying a consenting adult causes no harm, so the right to marry is the most important thing. Marrying a child or pet is likely to cause harm, so that supersedes the right to marry. Protection includes protection for children and animals against those who would harm them."
csjzelb,ranman1124,"Children and animals dont have rights. I dont care that gays can marry I care about the rights of the states and the people who live in them, that is out the window now.And marrying gays goes against quite few peoples religious beliefs, what about religious folks rights ( I am agnostic)? What about freedom of expression and freedom of association? You cant refuse services to people now or you will get sued out of business, yet these protections are in the actual constitution and marriage, gay or straight isnt.There is a difference between a right and a want."
csk0ij0,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"You're right. Gays can marry, now YOUR rights are out the window. You can't speak freely, you can be cruel and unusually punished, you aren't allowed to vote... oh no, wait, none of that is happening.And you don't have the right to be unoffended. Personally I find your bigoted, bronze-age bullshit offensive and hateful and stupider than selfies, but I don't have the right to stop you from saying it. Furthermore, I actually believe in your right to say it. But you don't believe in my right to marry any woman I choose. So you can fuck right off, back beneath the dark rock from whence you crawled."
csk0mbs,ranman1124,"I said i dont care if you marry the same sex, my problem is the fact that everything and everyone is protected now, if they have a loud enough lobbying group that can get their case to the proper court.> You can't speak freely, you can be cruel and unusually punished, you aren't allowed to vote...Again, we will see about that."
csk0tw9,PM_ME_UR_TITHES,"I'm going to say this once, and I'm going to try and make it simple.There is no gay agenda. Gay people do not hate straight people. We do not want to infringe upon your rights. We do not resent you, or envy you, or pity you. We do not want to infringe upon your right to speak freely, even when you use this right for the stupidest crap imaginable. We do not want you to be punished for being straight, much the less cruelly or unusually. We are not a conspiracy. We are not trying to harm you. If we could send you to summer camps to brainwash you to our way of thinking, or whip you in the square for being homophobic... we wouldn't. That's not our deal. We support your right to vote. We support your right to marry, and love, and have ""traditional"" families. We love you- no, seriously, we love you. We know a lot about hatred and intolerance and discrimination, and we don't want to perpetuate it. We want to give you a big, glittery, rainbow hug and hold hands and walk into the future as allies and supporters of each other.And this isn't directed to straight people, it's directed to everyone. On behalf of the 99% of the gay community that is tired of fighting and just wants acceptance, please stop the ""we will see about that"" BS. No one is trying to hurt you."
csk07x8,FlyingRock,Those religious people do not have to be involved in any same sex marriages they just can't refuse Paid services.
csk0b14,ranman1124,"We will see about that, stay tuned."
csk0hhb,derbyvoice71,"The right to free expression of religion as long as it stops at another person's right still exists there snowflake. If a particular church, pastor or religious body doesn't want to conduct a ceremony for a same-sex couple, they don't have to. What they can't do is stop someone's civil right to marriage with a legal party of their choosing, as marriage in this context refers to the government's stake in the civil contract named as such.As to your comment about a right and a want, people may want to bitch and moan, and that is their right. But they may not exercise a denial of a person's right to marry as long as it is with a consenting legal adult.Marriage in the US is a right, and has been affirmed by the courts in several instances. Basically, if one is a mentally competent person of legal age who meets the general qualifications and at least one of the participants is a citizen, then BAM! Marriage.http://www.afer.org/blog/14-supreme-court-cases-marriage-is-a-fundamental-right/"
csk0xgu,ranman1124,"> As to your comment about a right and a want, people may want to bitch and moan, and that is their right. But they may not exercise a denial of a person's right to marry as long as it is with a consenting legal adult.Same sex couples never had the right to marry until recently, therefore there couldnt be a denial of any imaginary right and no harm to them in any way shape or form, that has now changed and this will come back to bite social liberals in the ass at some point.The supreme court has now (and in the recent past) set the precedent that they can decide and define who is a protected class and what is a right, no constitutional amendment is needed now. Everything is on the table now, no limits and we don't need congress to make any laws anymore, and we damn site cant allow state referendums on any laws."
csk66br,derbyvoice71,"This is still the case of a denial of a right, not the absence of a right or the creation of a new right. What this issue deals with is whether a right that is ostensibly offered as a freedom to all was being denied to a particular group of people. While it is technically true that gay people had the right to marry someone of the opposite sex, place yourself in the position that this denies them freedom of choice. It would be like you being told who you can marry, as long as it is not the person you would want to. There is no establishment of a protected class, rather it is the now explicit expansion of a right offered to all citizens.As to your other point about the Supreme Court setting the precedent of this or that, they have been setting precedent since Marbury v. Madison. Consitutionality and judicial thought has run the gamut of Plessy v. Ferguson, Brown v. Board of Education, Loving v. Virginia, Kelo v. New London to Citizens United. Yes nine men and women may sometimes determine ""the law of the land,"" but in the long game, consitutionality should be based on the exercise of rights by as broad a group of people if it doesn't infringe on others' rights as opposed to the blind obedience of the tyranny of the majority.Many of the laws put in place for denial of marriage rights were done years ago. How quickly do you think those states or legislatures would be willing to place it back to the vote of the people, or do you think they might look at it as established law? Sometimes those within the power structure are hesitant to give up what they have."

csk2k5k,HerkDerpner,"The Constitution protects the rights of all citizens. The Supreme Court just made it a little harder to deny people those freedoms based on sexual orientation.

csk2ps0,gocks,"What right? Name the right that constitution protects from the state?Right to a specific state service like a marriage certificate? Really?!There is no such thing.So, now I will also be able to marry 10 women? No? Whoa boy, stop there, it is my ""freedom"" and it is protected by the constitution, just... just... I have no idea what part of it is protecting it and neither do you."
cskhm7h,HerkDerpner,Right to be treated equally under the law.
cskld3x,gocks,"We are all treated equally under the law.Marriage is a service offered to man and a woman, that is what the law says.What SCOTUS did here is make states change the laws to lose their original intent.Nowhere in the constitution it says that the marriage offered by the states should be between woman and woman.This is dangerous for the Republic on so many levels. Laws should be changed through the legislature not by the judicial system where 5 persons outvoted 4 other persons. This is outrageous. If you people do not want the Republic and have no problem with your RIGHTS being VOTED ON, go ahead, just say so. Just don't come back crying when the next vote goes against your rights."
csko93c,HerkDerpner,"> We are all treated equally under the law.Well now we are. Up until a few days ago, gays were treated differently in a lot of states.>Marriage is a service offered to man and a woman, that is what the law says.One that should be available to all adult citizens, regardless of sexual orientation, which was just now codified into national law.>What SCOTUS did here is make states change the laws to lose their original intent.What SCOTUS did here was uphold the constitution and prevent states from discriminating against people based on sexual orientation.>Nowhere in the constitution it says that the marriage offered by the states should be between woman and woman.Nowhere in the Constitution does it have the exact phrase ""slavery is wrong and illegal,"" or ""women should vote"" or ""you should be able to carry your AR-15 into Denny's."" Its intent must be derived from the wording that it does have. The Constitution protects the rights of all individuals equally, and prohibits laws that are enacted solely on the basis of religion. This protects gay marriage, even if the specific phrase ""gay marriage"" isn't found in the original document. >This is dangerous for the Republic on so many levels. Translation: ""THE SKY IS FALLING! THE SKY IS FALLING!!"""
csky4dt,gocks,"Gays were not treated differently. Marriage was defined by law as a service offered to man and woman. Not to man and man nor woman and woman nor man and 10 women.It has nothing to do with sexual orientation but with the sex as a biological trait.SCOTUS did not uphold the constitution. The 14th amendment has nothing to do with gay marriage.Since when the laws are being written by judiciaries and not by the legislative power?! Since when is accepted law change without the representation?!Yes, those things are pillars of the Republic, thing that SCOTUS shit upon. It is a most dangerous precedent one can think of.Five guys writing LAWS without participation of the legislative system what so ever... If that doesn't send chills down your spine, you are as stupid as you sound like from your posts."
cskzd75,HerkDerpner,"> Gays were not treated differently.Except for being able to be legally married.>Marriage was defined by law as a service offered to man and woman.That's how you defined it, not how the constitution defined it. Face it, you're mad because gays can no longer be discriminated against. You really hate gays, and anything that is good for them makes you hopping mad. I relish your discomfort."
csl0m00,gocks,"Again, it was a product that said ""man and woman"" offered by the state. If you want a different product or to change an existing one, use your legislature and representatives to do so!That's what a republic is!THE CONSTITUION DOES NOT DEFINE A MARRIAGE!Five guys in robes started writing laws and you cannot fathom how dangerous that is for the Republic?!I am all pro gay, I parade supporting LGBT population with my 2 year old son whenever I can. It has nothing to do with gays, fucktard.It has EVERYTHING to do with the downfall of the Republic!Do you even know what a republic is and why it is so important for human rights?!I bet you don't."
