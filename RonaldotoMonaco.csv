dlc7vv4,bolah,"Ronaldo goes to Monaco and marries Carlota Casiraghi. Suddenly every single person in front of her in the line of succession for Monaco's throne starts dying in suspicious circumstances, but nobody asks question as it would compromise the stability of Europe. The year is 2022, Ronaldo and Carlota become King and Queen of Monaco after Prince Albert resignation. Ronaldo's first words as he accepts the crown are: SIIIIMMMM. Carlota looks cringed, but it's too late now."

dlc6iji,blueradium,People say WWII started because Gandhi wrecked Hitler in career mode. Not saying it's 100% true but...
dlc8020,Andrex316,"I mean, if that were true, there would have been no Hitler because of the amount of nukes Gandhi would have used on him"
dlcaoxq,Pippelitraktori,I need Hitler in civ instead of bismarck. And Stalin. And Pol pot. They would have killer unique traits
dlcbnnp,fairlyrandom,I'd be willing to bet that there's mods for that.
dlcdxrf,wildguy13,There most definitely are mods for that.
dlcgf92,Bunde35,Hitler is a Pretty fun mod in Civ V check og out man! :-)

dlca43c,paultmanteau,How could Hitler not see that nuclear weaponry is the future?!
dlcfhqa,offiziersmesser,He did see it. Germany was the first country to start the programme. Then the allies kidnapped their scientists.
dlcrhju,camfa,"It also helped that Einstein was a jew. Seriously, they politicized everything, including science and nuclear power, and early academics and physicists who would have had a chance at developing nuclear weapons first were either purged or forced to join the army, or they emigrated by their own means before things got ugly, like Einstein. We got lucky that many key german/european scientists at the time were jewish."
dlcg0fr,paultmanteau,"And then used their knowledge for the space program, yeah, but I'm just extending the civ meme here"
dlcgxhp,mattoljan,Well you're not wrong actually
dlchkdw,paultmanteau,"Oh I know, and a lot of atrocities committed by the Japanese in China aided understanding of what it would take to send a human into space, too, and a whole lot of other things presumably"
dlciu7u,mattoljan,Well WWII in general taught us how to kill humans in mass numbers quite easily
dld04as,weasdasfa,I think the brits were already pretty good at that stuff.
dlchtsd,offiziersmesser,"Ah, fair enough."
dld0or4,JustMakinItBetter,"Pretty sure they weren't doing so well. If I remember correctly, the Nazis were world-leaders in missile technology, but well behind on nuclear weapons. That's why so many Germans ended up working at NASA and on ICBMs, but fewer on developing the actual warheads.Source: Visited the Peenemünde factory and museum a few years back, where they built the V1 and V2 rockets"
dlcj586,THEnimble_mongoose,> Then the allies kidnapped their scientists.Operation Paperclip.
dlcr4u3,camfa,That was after the war tho
dlc8n5e,El_Spacho,I heard it was because Gandhi t-bagged Adi in CS:GO...
dlc90w0,TheCousCousNonce,Neymar carried Gandhi
dlch4c6,Animastarara,Fanendo Adi would probably be a pretty bad CS:GO player so this I can see
dlc92ro,GhandisFlipFlop,Can confirm

But I am saying that just last night...Sid Lowe was on TV, pointedly making the remark that...everyone is caught up in this Bale-Must-Go theme, when, in reality...there's every bit as much of a chance of it being Ronaldo who is the 1 of the Big 3 to leave...thus freeing up the space for Mbappe. His argument for saying that was based on things he had heard from some in the Spanish press apparently. That, plus the logical argument that...if Zidane is trying to make the team younger, and fitter...then Bale is the one he wants to keep. And it's Cristiano Ronaldo that is the most expendable...And now this post/theory/story shows up today?...We'll see what happens but, it just doesn't seem all that far-fetched at the moment, all things considered.(""Where there's *smoke*...there may be *fire*."")"

dlcfz3y,FiskoSC,"Many people will find this stupid, it's really not. I'm a long time Monaco fan, I learned during the years lot of stuff about Rybolovlev and the russian side of his business. This guy goes really to details about some stuff. When you talk about Monaco team you always talk about Rybolovlev and Vasiliev, people always miss a big piece of the puzzle : Alexey Fedorichev, this discreet guy own Fedcom (ou Fedcominvest), he's a big fan of AS Monaco and wanted to buy the club before Rybolovlev did it, the prince of Monaco said no, if you want to know why make some research about this company, there is some shady sponsors in football but forget everything you know about them, Fedcom is the next level and you won't find any serious journalist research about this company, no one really want to stick their nose in this for good reasons. This guy bringing Fedorichev in the table is the reason on why he got my attention. Rybolovlev (our president) always tried to bring Ronaldo to Monaco, he's a big fan of the player and it's clearly a bilionaire fantasy, yes Monaco is a toy for him, PSG is a toy for the qatar sheik so is Chelsea and City. Those people build toilets in pure gold to shit on them so heh ... why not ... He never succeded / tried very much before of the FFP. Is this guy serious ? I don't know, the fact he posted on this forum (We call it ""Le Vizu"" and it's mostly used by old Monaco fans) and the fact the admin on this forum checked his IP and it was a positive match straight to Russia add even more mystery to this. It's really not 100% stupid, either it's (partialy) true or we are dealing with a genius of fakes, like the Al Pacino of the internet trolls. I'm not biased at all, the last thing I want is Ronaldo coming here (I like our projet like it is right now and making this type of investment is like doing a coinflip with the future of our club) especialy when it imply selling 3 of our best and promising players."
dlcwxpw,interneti,"""OP's IP was a positive match straight to russia"" *poops*"
dldqcs8,ionised,The plot thickens!
dlcvvj9,Flikker,"People act like it is out of this world. I don't see it happening at all, but I would still like to offer some support to your theory:Ronaldo is becoming a different, lesser player. He's 32 and stated he wanted to play 5 more years in 2015. Last season proved he will always be able to score 30+ goals a season, but he lost part of his speed, stamina and his drive. He's not as influential to the teamplay, not as he was, not as the top 5 players in this world are now. Second, to add to his tax rage, a supposed motivation to leave: he always FIRMLY stated he saw the end of his career at Madrid. The first ever contradicting statement was confirmed by teammates and happened 2 months ago. That doesn't mean he wants to go, but it does mean he is not as sure to end his carreer at Real as he was.Thirdly, Mbappe money is real. Offers by City and Madrid have been confirmed and would make it FFP possible.Fourth, Ronaldo has spoken often about his business ventures after his career. (i.e. AFP 2015: ""Many football players end their careers not knowing what to do. For me it's clear - I want to take care of my brands.""). Finnally, AS Monaco will seriously compete in the CL and the increasingly more interesting but less intensive Ligue 1. It's a serious top team that quality wise is just one tier below Madrid. This transfer could help transition his career, while decreasing the possibility of losing face. I'm rooting for it to happen. Not even for Monaco AS, though business wise it might be a smart decision and that is how things are being run there. It would be better to keep most/all talent and build a squad for the years to come, but it seems AS is being handled as a business. Plus the first Neymar to PSG rumour was tossed out of the window exactly the same way this is. It would just be too beautiful."
dld4qsm,BabyBenzizou,"Ronaldo not top 5 players in the world, lost his drive?? You can't seriously believe this"
dldffst,Flikker,"No, I'd put him in top 5. But he's not as influential to the play as the others in terms of key passes, assists, keeping possession. He's become a goalscorer pur sang.I do indeed think he has lost a part of his drive. Not his willingness to win, but the fire, for lack of a better word. Do you remember him at Man U and under Mourinho? He would spearhead attacks, take on one or multiple opponents and always come out on top. He's definitely not that player anymore."
dldgsd2,juggernaut8,As theories go it's not that unbelievable. Rybolovlev has the money and Ronaldo has the ego to be the most expensive player of all time. A massive paycheck for the last 4-5 years would be great too. The only hitch to this theory is Ronaldo leaving Real for a weakened Monaco. I don't see that happening unless Monaco is planning on making a bunch of other purchases as soon as the Ronaldo deal concludes.
dldfeh5,dngrs,"> there is some shady sponsors in football but forget everything you know about them, Fedcom is the next level and you won't find any serious journalist research about this company, no one really want to stick their nose in this for good reasons. what do you mean?"
dldip3u,UsernameNumberZero,No one wants to be found dead.
dllhlbp,Odesit,"Oh come on, this is bullshit. There's journalism for freaking mexican cartels and ISIS, why wouldn't there be journalism for a shitty company? Maybe because no one cares about it?"
dldfolf,M0rbz,"I simply cannot believe this because:1. Ronaldo always wants a competitive squad on his side, Monaco clearly isn't; they sold 2 of their best players Mendy and Bakayoko, they are clearly disadvantaged compared to PSG for Ligue1 and to the top clubs for UCL2. Monaco has such a low fanbase and is not constantly under spotlight like Real or Man Utd. This would lower CR7 fanbase as well, decreasing his income from sponsorships and effectively gaining less money (CR7 money is primarly from sponsorships, not from wage)"
dlcorwe,That_LTSB_Life,"No, it really is stupid. Rybo needs cash, it's an open secret. The vultures got wind a long time ago."
dlcpbi1,FiskoSC,"Rybo is still losing money with the club despite the fact we are selling that crazy he didnt recover his initial investment, if he really needed cash he wouldnt have started renewing our training center and buy a brand new football club 4 months ago as a satellite club for Monaco. I already explained 50 times that his divorce costed him +-400M€ (not half of his fortune as we read here 10 times a day) which is basicaly the equivalent of giving your TV to your ex-wife as divorce compensation for normal people"
dlcpzcu,That_LTSB_Life,"Hah, yeah, a TV. Listen, settlements are paid in cash. Whatever his net worth is, it's not all cash. Similarly, capital investment is - for a multitude of reasons - not at all the same thing as cashflow. Investment in captial projects often forms part of an effort to restructure, and is not incompatible with limited cash flow, tax burdens, and liabilities. Rather it's often a way to address potential problems caused by an unpredictable balance sheet in the medium term. It doesn't take much of a grasp of current international economics to figure out that it's not just his divorce that's cost him, and why he would want to convert as much as possible to local assets."
dlcqek3,jmarFTL,"> Listen, settlements are paid in cashI don't have a dog in this fight, but as a lawyer, this is just wrong. There is no rule they have to be paid in cash, you can pay out in whatever you want, property, whatever, and they often are. They're just a contract between two parties like anything else."
dlcqios,That_LTSB_Life,"yeah, I realised my mistake a minute ago.I think the point is we're talking about assets that are generally amongs the easiest to liquidate."
dlcrb16,FiskoSC,"Rybolovlev net worth is 8bn USD according to Forbes, free to you to believe this number and to believe that Rybolovlev doesnt have at least 3 or 4 times this amounts hidden in tax heavens like every other russian billionaires. My point is that you don't need to liquidate assets when you are able to make big investments like he did with Monaco, if he really struggle to pay his divorce he wouldnt invest in another club, that's just common sense. Thinking that paying 400M€ will hurt his wallet is pure madness."

dlcwr97,MourinhosEgo,Just stopping in to see if anyone here actually read this
dlddosn,archtme,"It's a well written and compelling story but I doubt CR7 will leave RMA this summer. And here's why:1) all the rumors about him leaving exploded once his tax case became public, to divert attention and reduce damage done to his image. As the case went a bit colder the rumors kind of died out. 2) RMA are enjoying their greatest period in decades right now and CR7 is playing to be considered the GOAT. Messi still has more titlea than him, and RMA are in a great position to pick up more. RMA are also way more likely to pick up more UCL titles. CR7 currently sits at a record 4 UCL titles along with the likes of Xavi, Iniesta, Pique, Messi etc. Adding more would give him more of a GOAT argument vs Messi.3) I truly believe RMA would have considered selling him this summer if it wasn't for his goal haul at the tail end of the UCL. People who watched RMA in the last few years know that CR7 has declined but he kept posting good numbers. For 80 % of the 16/17 season he was equally invisible during the games but for the first time he also weren't scoring as much. He had like 2 or 3 goals up until the UCL quarter final and wasn't producing that many goals in the League either.But vs Bayern and onwards he had a crazy scoring spree which showed he can still be decisive. If it wasn't for that I think the ruthless Perez (who nowadays seem to finally have gotten the great team he always wanted to build) would have forced him out.4) I think CR7 intends to play at the very top for as long as possible to try to outlast Messi. This rivalry motivates him and Messi is posting better goal ratios and has more titles. Messi will retake various records from CR7 if CR7 quits before he does, So to beat him CR7 needs to play for as long as Messi does or beyond Messis career. CR7 is an incredible professional, second to no athlete in the world so he can probably play for many more years. Off the pitch he seems to leave almost everything out because he knows he's hitting the end of his career and once that's done he can do all that other stuff.If your goal is to be considered the best It is prefarable to play at the very top in a club like RMA as opposed to a top15 club like Monaco. The question is whether he can stay relevant and as I mentioned above, he did have a scare in 16/17. Messi's style of playing would allow him to play and stay at the top for many more years but he has never given the impression of someone who wants to play into his 40's. Nor is he driven by the rivalry and will likely just quit/go to Newell's when he feels like it. Many believe that might happen when he's 34 or 35. Chances are CR7 will try to hang on to RMA as long as Messi is still in Barca.5) Thank you for the downvotes."

Look at Bernardo, for example, he came in for 15m left for 50(?)m, salaries were paid back in goals assists and carry."
