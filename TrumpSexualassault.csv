dcojs2r,Austinthelamp,Did you read the fucking title?
dcobvab,,This subreddit is for civil discussion? Did you read the title of the thread?
dcoctdk,,Is some part of it incorrect?
dcodew8,,Oh so being 'correct' constitutes civility now color me surprised we ended up in Trump's America.
dcodron,,I asked you a question. Is that your answer?
dcokk59,MasterBongRips,"Except he asked the question first. So you answered with a question. Even though he asked a yes or no question first. Mmm, but no, you have a better understanding of yes or no questions, my bad."
dcokoj6,,"He didn't ask me a question. I asked him a question. Therein lies the difference. Good try though, bongrips. Maybe you'll be right on the Internet next time."
dcokt2c,MasterBongRips,"Shit, silly me. I accidentally fed the troll"
dcokxqc,,"With original quips like that, you should have your own talk show."
dcol5cj,MasterBongRips,"A salty, Hillary loving, sore loser like you should definitely work for CNN, you'd fit right in."
dcouf24,sivilised,"Haha damn, some passive aggressive there. Hillary is going to be your last enemy by the time Trump takes away your precious weed"
dcolbd3,,"I've already expressed my contempt for Hillary Clinton elsewhere in this thread. A good attempt though, bongrips."
dcolpc6,MasterBongRips,"Hmm, sorry ARAndyOniyate , unless you used another account. I don't see anything anti Hillary posted by you. Good attempt though, ARAndyOniyate"
dcon470,,"I suppose without context referring to her as ""a failed politician"" doesn't outright give it away."
dcoduu2,,"Yes, my that is my answer. Being correct has absolutely nothing to do with civility, and being 'correct' even less so. But due to exactly this type of thinking we now have a president who gets to conflate the two and pretend that transcends civility. Good luck dealing with what you have created."
dcoe5ev,,"It might be your answer, but it doesn't answer the question. If presented with a yes or no question, and you write in nonsense, it doesn't make you any less wrong. You don't win through zugzwang."
dcoe7im,,"You're some how let yourself become under the impression people need submit to your every hope and wish. Hillary thought the same way during her campaign. You asked a question, and got an answer you didn't like."
dcoeuwy,,I asked a question in which no possible outcome is unknown to me. I know the answer about whether or not the title is correct. You know the answer too. You complaining to me about a failed politician I have nothing to do with doesn't negate that the title is a correct statement.
dcogzex,Exemus,/r/iamverysmart
dcojml6,,"Do you know the three possible outcomes of a coin toss? Heads, tails, or holy shit did you see that eagle grab the coin mid air? It's not an intellectual thing to know the outcome of a yes or no answer."
dcog2qz,,>I asked a question in which no possible outcome is unknown to melmao fucking liberals I swear to god you deserve Trump and you don't even realize it
dcojvod,,I'm a liberal for stating knowledge of how yes or no questions work?
dcojnfe,POO_BRAINS,He means 'yes' or 'no'
dcojsfg,,Exactly. These responses are infuriating o.o
dcog8jo,FlyntFlossy912,Lol you are so full of it.
dcojxf8,,I'm not bragging about winning a Nobel prize here. I'm stating I have a fundamental understanding of how yes or no questions work.
dcol31m,FlyntFlossy912,Sure sounds like you want a medal because you know how to answer questions.Lmao you are crazy.
dcoz0iy,,[deleted]
dcp06fb,,Please explain to me how straw man applies to asking someone if the title contains an incorrect statement.
dcok76j,,Is claiming something and then acting like it's fact make it correct? Despite the reality?
dcok8ib,,"Tell us the reality, chief. Also, no, it does not."
dcokqjn,,"The reality is he bragged about hitting on women who were consensually receptive to the act. That's the hard, cold truth. Nothing you bitch and whine about will change that. Nothing you scream about will alter what simply listening to the audio reveals. Just like his election and the future of our country."
dcol2d5,,"I can see how that might seem like the reality if, as a Donald Trump supporter, you watched the video; then proceeded to explain away his actions in your head, and not do any further research into accounts of women who had interactions with him."
dcolg6b,,">not do any further research into accounts of women who had interactions with him. You mean the ones that vanished into thin air after they found out no money was coming their way?>you watched the video; then proceeded to explain away his actions in your headI just watched it less than three minutes ago to refresh my memory. He clearly said ""they let you.."" before adding any additional action on top of that. He would only make advances on consenting women. You're full of shit and everybody can tell. That's why you lost and are continuing to do so."
dcon5ov,,"What did I lose? Shit, I didn't know I was in a race."
dcoomn9,,"Assumption on my part, but I assumed you didn't want Trump to win."
dcoq9g9,,"Oh, I didn't. I wasn't running against him though. Five more years til I can run. Which isn't practical, since there isn't an election that year."
dcof4mg,Umfaan,"Yea, the assault part. Nowhere did he say he raped or assalted anyone."
dcofb38,,">Sexual assault is any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient.I'd say grabbing a woman's vagina while hitting on her is sexual contact without explicit consent. Sexual assault doesn't mean he penetrated someone against their will, or violently harmed anyone. It's a legal term, and while I'll admit it may sound violent, I am not the one who invented the term."
dcohpwi,,"So then every president has committed sexual assault and likely boasted of it too.Come on, do you think jimmy gets explicit consent every time he starts getting it on with Rosalynn Carter?"
dcogok5,Umfaan,"Exactly! This is definitely a crude story, but not anything more than that, sex talk/interaction between two consenting adults, there's no reference of him forcefully doing anything against anyone's will. ""They let him do it."" Seriously people"
dcofe0s,,[deleted]
dcofkcg,,"Not only did he say he kissed them without asking, he followed it by saying he'd grab them by the pussy That is something he said. On tape. It really happened, and wasn't an SNL joke or whatever some people are thinking. The man who will be president in a couple hours bragged on tape that he could just walk up and grab women's vaginas, and they wouldn't fight him off because he's powerful."
dcofutq,masterslayor,But did he do it? Or just joke about it behind closed doors probably in a context that we don't hear on the tape.
dcojppn,,"Sorry friendo, if there are first hand accounts from many people with similar stories, and he admits to the described behavior... That may not be enough proof to convict him in a court of law, but it's enough for me to believe enough that I don't want that person to be the president."
dcoh6lc,Umfaan,"Out of context. So you have a nice date with somebody, you're making out on the couch, watching Netflix. do you say: ""excuse me, please may I grab your pussy?"" If it feels right, you just do it, and either it happens or they push your hand away."
dcojkq0,,"It's not out of context. He was even talking about a married woman right before that, how he was pursuing her even after being rejected.He literally said that when there's someone beautiful around him he just starts trying to kiss them, and because he's powerful he gets away with just grabbing their vaginas as an in."
dcoc0xs,Exemus,I honesty wonder if anyone truly believes this

dcocdga,,">Personal attacks, whether explicit or implicit, are not permitted.What a fucking joke of a subreddit. If that was true this post should have been deleted the moment it was posted. Instead it has 25.1k upvotes and gold."
dcoigvz,Yanahlua,How is using a mans own words and his own behaviour a personal attack?
dcokdqc,,"Because he never boasted about sexually assaulting anybody. He talked about a consensual act of love making, and you fucking know it."
dcokuq2,Yanahlua,So grabbing the genitals of a married woman who rebuffed your advances isn't sexual assault?
dcolma1,,"He never said that he touched her. See, this is what I'm talking about. Everybody here is so blatantly full of shit and they don't even realize how obvious it is to an outsider. Half of the news articles referenced here are from Salon or some other bogus publication that has zero legitimacy. Anything you look at mentioned in here negative about Trump ends up being fake news."
dcol5xs,,hahaha Love making. Old man Donald Drumpf is a child rapist. But then you Nazis told children in WW2 they were taking a shower so it's not surprising you haven't changed much. haha You're a comedian. Love making. Donald Drumpf's definition of love making is having a Russian crack whore shit in his mouth.
dcopvm9,PanicLiz,"Lmfao ""nazis"". I see no one acting fascist and murdering citizens bc their leaders told them to bc they're Jewish and don't have blonde hair and blue eyes. Why is the term *nazi* used so loosely surrounding Trump? The citizens who support Trump are not murderers. They do not seek out people of another religion and kill them on command. Trump supporters do not go around killing people bc they were told to."
dcodp02,some_1_needs_a_hug,Total hatchet job.
dcokurx,123xxxxxxgg,Lol how ironic
dcond0k,PanicLiz,It's virtually impossible to have a civil discussion after you let a post with that title fly.

dcoc5c7,SlaughterhouseIce9,"Here's some things Hunter S. Thompson had to say about Richard Nixon.> It is Nixon himself who represents that dark, venal and incurably violent side of the American character that almost every country in the world has learned to fear and despise. Our Barbie-doll president, with his Barbie-doll wife and his boxful of Barbie-doll children is also America's answer to the monstrous Mr. Hyde. He speaks for the Werewolf in us; the bully, the predatory shyster who turns into something unspeakable, full of claws and bleeding string-warts on nights when the moon comes too close…-> If the current polls are reliable... Nixon will be re-elected by a huge majority of Americans who feel he is not only more honest and more trustworthy than George McGovern, but also more likely to end the war in Vietnam. The polls also indicate that Nixon will get a comfortable majority of the Youth Vote. And that he might carry all fifty states... This may be the year when we finally come face to face with ourselves; finally just lay back and say it — that we are really just a nation of 220 million used car salesmen with all the money we need to buy guns, and no qualms at all about killing anybody else in the world who tries to make us uncomfortable. The tragedy of all this is that George McGovern, for all his mistakes... understands what a fantastic monument to all the best instincts of the human race this country might have been, if we could have kept it out of the hands of greedy little hustlers like Richard Nixon. McGovern made some stupid mistakes, but in context they seem almost frivolous compared to the things Richard Nixon does every day of his life, on purpose... Jesus! Where will it end? How low do you have to stoop in this country to be President?-> We've come to a point where every four years this national fever rises up — this hunger for the Saviour, the White Knight, the Man on Horseback — and whoever wins becomes so immensely powerful, like Nixon is now, that when you vote for President today you're talking about giving a man dictatorial power for four years. I think it might be better to have the President sort of like the King of England — or the Queen — and have the real business of the presidency conducted by... a City Manager-type, a Prime Minister, somebody who's directly answerable to Congress, rather than a person who moves all his friends into the White House and does whatever he wants for four years. The whole framework of the presidency is getting out of hand. It's come to the point where you almost can't run unless you can cause people to salivate and whip each other with big sticks. You almost have to be a rock star to get the kind of fever you need to survive in American politics.Imagine if he'd lived to see Trump. He saw it coming though. Maybe that's why he checked out."
dcox38x,grtkbrandon,This reads like it could have been written today. I don't know whether to be filled with hope that eventually Trump will pass or filled with dread that after all this time nothing has changed.

If she is capable of consent (not asleep/black out drunk) and she doesnt stop him, and there's no threats or implied coercion (duress), then its assumed consent is given.

And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.He clearly indicates he 'doesn't wait' and just 'grabs/kisses'. While folks are leaning on the power and attractiveness it might bring to certain ladies, he's clearly outlining that he 'just goes for it'. That is the activity of a man (Cosby) so beset by willing gold diggers who then goes to grab/touch/kiss **any** attractive woman *without consent* - which is by definition sexual assault.To try to give insight into why this is disturbing I'll change one aspect of the statement:> You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you *have a gun*, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.The background statement about the specific individual this comment was raised around was:> Trump: I moved on her, and I failed. I'll admit it. I did try and f--- her. She was married, and I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, ‘I'll show you where they have some nice furniture.' I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there. And she was married. A man who was as married at the time hitting on another married woman.

The rest of it is his kind of awkward and creepy, but harmless, way of boasting and trying to look cool about how he's such a player.Honestly I think if you listen to it it's pretty obvious that this was his intention, but if it's even a plausible interpretation then I think we have to abide by the principle of charity and take it that way.Now, that's still quite a distasteful joke, and doesn't exactly reflect on him fantastically, but it's tame in comparison to the kind of joke you would see in reddit threads any day of the week, and I don't draw any conclusions about anyone's character from those. It just means they, and he, are into a certain kind of dirty joke.If there was any evidence that he had actually 'grabbed [anyone] by the pussy' that'd be a different matter entirely. There may yet be, given that it looked like he's going to be sued about it. But I'm reserving judgement until I see some facts. There are many reasons why he will likely be an abomination of a president, but I don't personally think that is one of them. It certainly doesn't demonstrate that he's a conman or a rapist.

He was *boasting* of being a big celebrity from whom women were just dying for attention and thus were (in his mind) consenting to sexual contact from him. The fact that he admits ""not getting anywhere"" with a woman in the quote makes it very clear that he's not boasting about assault, nor views what he's doing as assault.

The fact that he acknowledges not getting anywhere with her indicates that he is concerned about consent.It doesn't take that much charitable reading of ""let"" in this context to interpret it an actual belief that they not only acquiesced but actively desired his attentions, especially considering the mention of his celebrity status as an explanation for why.

dconc07,stillhasmuchness,I suppose. It's her 70th birthday this weekend and as a gift my brother decided to make a list of 70 special things about her. Between 3 siblings it took a lot of struggling and time to come up with things and most of them had to do with her being consistent in her religion and her helping the homeless. She's a huge advocate for the homeless in a large city and was feeding them leftovers from a prayer breakfast every Saturday out of the back of her car by herself and it grew into a van and then a building. She's been consistent in that for the past 35 years. It's about the only thing I respect about her. So just wanted to say that she has done some good in the world even if she has very narrow views.
dcopnfv,ruiner8850,"I don't want you to think I was ripping on your mom as a person in general, because that was not my intent. It was only about that one specific thing that I don't understand how Christians can get over. It wasn't even only about the sexual assault (which somehow isn't one of the Ten Commandments), but also the adultery implied in those statements. Trump never asked for forgiveness for what he did, he just tried to justify it by saying it was locker room talk. Once again though, I'm not trying to judge your mother in any way other than your original statement. I do however have some respect for the concept of people being intellectually constant. I'd almost rather disagree with someone who is constant than agree with someone who always changes their stances based on how it affects them. Trump is one of those people. A good example of this is the Electoral College where he was completely against it when he doesn't like what he thought was the result, but was completely for it when it helped him. I'm sure if he had 3 million more votes but lost he would have said all kinds of horrible things about the Electoral College."
dcoq0lb,stillhasmuchness,"Never thought that at all. Usually I'm the one ripping on her. It's very rare that I will say something nice about her, your comment just made me think differently in the way that yes, she has been consistent. I honestly was more ripping her because her children can barely think of any nice things to say about her that aren't forced. I find a lot of her view points that she hides behind religion to be very concerning."

Sure it's sexist and rapey and all sorts of other unpleasant things, but this post is beyond misleading and clearly just meant to deligitimize his election. And that's fine . . . For those who actually voted.I voted against him, before anyone starts in on that, but I think this sort of thing helped elect him. It's one more supposed example of the ""dishonest liberal media"" that consolidated his base--the base that put him in the White House. This kind of sloppy demonization is a great way to lock in a second term for him."
dcoial4,symphony64,You make a cogent point.
dcoi85g,OgFinish,"You're a very sheltered person. ""Locker room talk"" is real. Any guy who tells you that he doesn't say fucked up stuff to his friends for fun is a beta, a white knight, or lying. Argue all you want, but this is objective reality. Sorry life doesn't fit your fairytale narrative."

No, but when you're with friends its funny. I doubt Trump actually grabs women by the pussy.This was before he probably even considered being president so give the guy a break. I know you hate the guy, most people do. But choosing to shit on every little thing is silly. You people sound like my coworkers shitting on the new people at work.

dcol8he,Austenh96,"He did say ""they let you do it"". Consensual sex != sexual assault."
dcomn0p,symphony64,"""They let you do it"" isn't ""they want you to do it"" or ""they'll like it when you do it."" It could mean something totally different. As someone who's been assaulted before, ""letting them do it"" could mean not saying anything and just letting the bullshit happen. Especially from someone with such a high status. I don't take this as consent at all."
dcp2v5h,Austenh96,"The definition of consent is not ""they want you to do it"" or ""they'll like it when you do it"". The definition of consent is: ""permission for something to happen or agreement to do something"", and I'm pretty sure letting someone do something falls into that category. That's it."
dcp4ckc,symphony64,"Ok so when a girl gets molested and doesn't say anything and just lets it happen, she's consenting? Don't be so reliant on a fucking dictionary. There's something called ""between the lines."" I stand by my statement. Silence isn't consent."
dcp5vee,Austenh96,"If by ""girl"" you mean a minor, then no, because by law, minors can't consent to sex. If you mean an adult who is fully conscious, and doesn't express any disapproval? I'd say it depends on the specific case."
dcol9o6,reebs81,An acquaintance said it's locker room talk. And it's something he would say so he was OK with it. I told him that's why you're not president. That was right before the election. I guess I were wrong. /s

dcomfhh,sketchyuser,It just depends what you're trying to imply by misogynist. Merely saying this stuff doesn't make him incapable of leading our country to more success and improved lives. So if I were to agree that his comments from 2005 were misogynistic it doesn't mean that I agree that he isn't the better choice of the two options in 2016 and that he won't be a successful president.

dcok4a2,lIIIIllIIIIl,Yes. Something he should be ashamed of saying but at least we live in a world now where most people read that and don't like it. There is progress its just all memed out and layered weird. But the reason that's a story is because people don't like that he said that and I think that is a good thing. Maybe everything being transparently fucky will help us to actually figure out what is best for us (all living creatures) as a whole.
dcokfp4,stormblade260,The problem is that the reason anyone who wasn't in power didn't like it is because he was saying he could get away with sexual assault and that is morally reprehensible to most people. The people who are in power were more concerned that he was caught openly discussing a very simple truth of this world: there are a different set of rules and expectations and thus consequences for the wealthy and the poor.
dcp0a6k,lIIIIllIIIIl,Yeah another reason why I like that the leaked conversation came out and a discussion is being had on it. I want people to realize there are different rules for the elite. The elite do not support the poor but the poor support the elite and we're in mirror world now bb.

You are defining normal, everyday humans as a toxicity that has to be excised from your life. What a sad, pathetic bubble you must live in now, if you weren't using hyperbole. People are just people. We all generally want the same things out of life. Any Trump supporters you knew weren't just trying to crush all the things you value most. They were just voting their conscience. They were voting in the hope that their kids would live and love in a decent World with a decent economy where they could work hard and succeed. People like you who are becoming so polarised over this election are so laughably sad. I was sad when I woke up and Obama was president. But did I flip out and March in the streets, vehemently screaming ""Fuck Barack Obama""? No. And why is that? Because more people thought he could do a better job at making a better future for themselves. And I had plenty of friends who couldn't hold their excitement in at having the first black president in office. They were so excited about the huge changes coming. But today, watching Obama leave office, the only changes that have even remotely affected my life have been an atrocious Price increase for my health insurance. Atrocious increase for insurance costs, anyways. You are going to be fine. If you are lucky... If we are all lucky, then Trump will deliver on some of his promises and kick the economy in the pants and get the US crushing it. And you will live in a better world for it. But in the meantime, feel free to keep being the petty guy who doesn't associate with ""them"" because they happen to think a brighter future looks a little different than you. Edit: a word.

dcojyb5,robotsdonthaveblood,"Perhaps all these alleged victims should speak up, it's not like the media would silence them. If there was a real, quantifiable case against Trump for sexual assault it would be blasted in our faces just as much as his statement of ""they let you do anything.""I'm more than willing to hear the other side, but unless they do something, build a case, present evidence, or even just talk to legal council regarding this matter the only confirmed data we have to work with is Trumps statement. If anyone has any proof of Trump committing an actual unwanted, uninvited, non consensual sexual act on -anyone- they really ought to have spoke up by now, you know... Before the inauguration. Maybe months ago when the bus video came out... I mean you did watch it all, right? If so... Maybe you can tell me who suggested who hugs who, and who consented to that act.Oh well, as a Canadian all I can do is grab a bag of popcorn and watch the circus. I will say, though, it's a shame 150 million of you south of me are too foolish to recognize consent, and will continue to point to a statement implying consent as proof of sexual assault."
dcokc07,GreenShinobiX,"You know alleged victims have spoken up, right?"
dcoksi4,robotsdonthaveblood,Without evidence. Thankfully Americans have due process so they don't lock people up for allegations without evidence.
dcomspq,thatssoright,"Are you kidding me? Each case has varying degrees of credibility and proof and all the Great Orange one did was say they were all debunked, which is one of his standard lies.

dcolqse,CisWhiteMealWorm,I've seen tons of people here literally say that Trump should be behind bars for rape.

dcot67f,a_warm_room,Whether it meets the definition of a crime or not has never mattered to me. It's unacceptable regardless.
dcp2ttn,robotsdonthaveblood,"Sexual assault is a crime. Saying women let him do anything isn't sexual assault. That's the problem here. The headline is misleading, but you don't care about that because it fits your desired narrative."

That's the root of his statement after all, it's them allowing it."
dcp6hwf,a_warm_room,I'm not sure why you're making such a big issue of this. Didn't you say you're Canadian? Why are you going to bat for a controversial US president?
dcp9tjd,robotsdonthaveblood,"Because up here we're starting to create quite a hugbox nationally, and I disagree with calling a consensual act sexual assault. His policies may fuck up my whole nation but that doesn't mean he needs to be labelled a rapist. So much sensationalism, it's like our lives must constantly be jacked up to 11, saturated with the most extreme talking points they can jam into a ten second sound bite every three minutes. He's a crappy person, there are a number of easily proven instances to that effect, we don't need to resort to bullshit to get that point across."
dcokpgu,Marshawk1000,"Several women have spoken up and explicitly described assault. For example: https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/us/politics/donald-trump-women.htmlIt's worth noting that it's very common for women to choose not to speak up about sexual assault cases, for a variety of reasons. It's likely that at least a third of such cases never get reported. My point being, it's not as simple as saying ""they really ought to have spoke up by now.""One woman is in fact suing:http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-accuser-summer-zervos-files-defamation-suit-against-president-elect-n708031"
dcolvtk,robotsdonthaveblood,"If they chose not to speak up at the pivotal moment the entire nation was willing to listen to them how exactly can they ever hope for justice? It may not be easy to come forth and talk about it, it will likely be traumatic, but unless you come out and speak about it no one can do anything to help. Regardless, you cant just assume there are droves of silent victims based on one shitty statement by a pompous asshole, there is no evidence one way or the other. Focus on facts you can point to. Both articles devolve into he said vs she said and neither side has evidence to the contrary. Are we just supposed to take the claims of these woman as gospel? Is that the justice system you want in America?And a defamation suit isn't a rape allegation, while she cites the reason she's suing for defamation as unwanted sexual contact the suit itself is not for sexual assault."
dcopn2t,AdventureBum,"They did, what part of that are you not understanding?"
dcoqugi,robotsdonthaveblood,I think you're missing the part where criminal charges of sexual assault aren't being brought against Trump. There is no evidence. There is hearsay and a defamation suit. That's it.
dcos8u4,AdventureBum,What evidence are you expecting? A recording of him actually assaulting someone?
dcoyh9a,Marshawk1000,"If you look at the date of the article, it's from Oct. 12th. That was quite a pivotal moment, with the election just a few weeks away. I made no claim about ""droves of silent victims,"" but more than a dozen women came forward with stories like these before the election. It doesn't really get more pivotal in terms of timing or bravery than that. People blew off accusers of Clinton, Cosby, Polanski, and many others too. Rarely is there hard and fast evidence in cases of sexual assault. Here are some good reasons to listen to those who are willing to speak out:http://www.revelist.com/feminism/believing-sexual-assault-survivors/1378/they-arent-lying/1You asked for people to speak up at a pivotal time, and they did. You asked for multiple voices, and they exist. You asked for evidence and a case, and at least one is being built (yes it is for defamation, but since Zervos's claim is she's been defamed for lying about sexual assault, and the statute of limitations for a legal claim has expired, we can all understand what it's really about). Even if all of this winds up being false, a president's words have inordinate power to influence national culture, hence the term ""bully pulpit."" The consequences of rhetoric are far-reaching, and go beyond the victims who have spoken out."
dcp474u,robotsdonthaveblood,"So we should always believe every claim of sexual assault? Every single one of them regardless of evidence one way or the other? That's a dangerous precipice you're on.Jian Ghomeshi was accused of sexual assault up here in Canada in 2014, for two years he was demonized, couldn't leave Ontario and had to reside with his mother as a grown man. His career as a national radio host ruined and his name forever plastered on the internet as a potential rapist. One allegation blossomed into more once media attention started hammering it into our Canadian faces all day long and soon one sexual assault charge was five, with an aggravated choking charge tossed in for good measure.You can check out the details yourself with a little google-sleuthing, but I'll spill the beans on my point here; collusion and deception. In fact Justice William Horkins went on to state that the inconsistency and outright deception of the witness' testimony had irreparably weakened the prosecution's case. Each complainant demonstrated, to some degree, a willingness to ignore their oath to tell the truth on more than one occasion.So in the world you want to live in would have Jian in jail just because some women said he did a thing and we shoulda believed them no matter what. Thankfully, Justice Horkins called the bullshit for what it is and the man is at least not in jail. He still went through years of legal proceedings, was still demonized for years in the media, lost his career, and still looks like a rapist the moment you google his name. That's fucked up, don't you think? And what's worse, you think these women would have been held in contempt at the very least, but no, there was no consequence for what they did to Jian, or lying under oath, or misleading the public, so on and so on... No, I don't think we need to be taking every accusation at face value, because you see, contrary to what your hugbox article states; they WERE lying, and a judge caught them doing so. Edit: if people really want to help get justice for victims of sexual assault, you have to encourage them to do what must be done with any crime; report it immediately. You do not wait for your house to burn down to call the fire department, or the corpse to bloat n decay to report a murder, you report it as fast as possible to ensure the highest possibility of getting justice for the victim. It may be very emotionally traumatic to have to recount the events so shortly after but life, particularly in that situation, isn't easy, no one ever said it would be. Don't wait 20 years, or even 20 days. Do it now! I mean, shit, do we afford the same luxury of infinite time for the poor souls who witnessed their loved ones being murdered? Of course not, we encourage them to speak out and call the police -right now-!"
dcpghhl,Marshawk1000,"The idea is not that there should be no due process or investigation, but rather that a premise of belief of victims is both the humane and statistically supported (~95% are true) way to begin. It certainly doesn't mean accusers should be jailed without a trial, or that vanishingly rare cases, like the one you describe, are impossible. It's not dangerous at all, but rather a healthy place to begin responding to a unique and sensitive form of crime. And as my article mentioned, this is also how you get people to answer your call of reporting it immediately. Survivors of sexual assault are not just uncourageous across the board, waiting many years or saying nothing. The fact that so many remain silent is a clear indicator that this is a unique kind of trauma: it comes with a particular blend of shame, guilt, and stigma, frequent lack of justice, fear of reprisal, and other factors that make it exponentially harder to talk about. It's all too easy to condescend to survivors, not knowing what kind of experience this is. Here's some additional reading on why victims don't report:https://www.umd.edu/ocrsm/files/Why-Is-Sexual-Assault-Under-Reported.pdfhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rape-victims-report-police_us_57ad48c2e4b071840410b8d6"
dcoom4o,Mattbird,"They did speak up, one woman already went to trial but felt that trying to find justice wasn't worth the price of death threats and harassment from Trump and his sycophants.At the same time the nation was most wiling to listen, there were just as many people who were willing to hate them for coming forward. Why is it so hard to stand against the man with one of the biggest voices on the planet? Why is it so hard to stand up against the(now) most powerful man in the world? Why is it so hard to stand up and shout to the whole world how you were taken advantage of by a man for whom people work so tirelessly for his approval? **Why is it so hard for them to just speak up?**"
dcon18o,Hans_Brickface,"> Take the assaulter's word for it? Sure. Whether he actually did or did not commit assault is not the point here. The point here is that he is not boasting about sexual assault in this recording. If he were, it would've been something like, 'I tried to fuck her, she didn't want me to, but I did it anyway. Instead, he said he tried to fuck her, but couldn't. That does not sound like a man committing assault. He also described the other acts as consensual. Whether they actually were or not, I don't know. I wasn't there.I think the REAL reason that people don't like what he said is that it underscores and uncomfortable truth, and that is that women whore themselves out to stars like politicians do to corporations. But don't just take my word for it:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDQ1lxB0goYMind you, Trump sounds like a bush league lech, but the article title is just flat out wrong."
dcopiwu,AdventureBum,"This is the same logic that the authors of the Old Testament used to say a woman who was raped should be punished for being raped if she didn't scream loud enough. Assault is assault even if your position gives you the power to do it and people ""let"" you because of your power. It's just as revolting."

dcomfgp,robotsdonthaveblood,"It's pretty shitty that approximately half of Americans don't understand the definition of consent. I'm not saying Trump isn't scum, but I am saying he stated these women allow it.

dcohlld,scarabic,"True, and in many ways the whole bit about trying to fuck a married woman is more damning. He was literally recounting something specific he did, there. Not only an immoral act, which should have hurt him with his base, but he also failed by his own account, which must be humiliating for his tiny little ego.""Grab em by the pussy"" was said in a looser, more hypothetical way.""*When* you're a star, you *can* do XYZ.""Of course, the left wing offendedness machine pumped this up as a recounting of specific past sexual assaults, which, grammatically, it unfortunately is not. One man telling another ""here's some crazy shit I can totally do, dude"" is actually closer to an empty boast than it is an admission to rape. This is why the ""locker room talk"" defense actually worked with a lot of people.It's completely disgusting either way. My only point is that if people wanted to inflict damage on Trump, they emphasized the wrong sound bite, and did what right-wingers always accuse them of: pump something up until it means something other than what it says."

dcokcdy,TheSpreadHead,"Use standup comedy as an example. Do you honestly believe every joke you've heard is true? Because they aren't. They're over the top and ridiculous to get a laugh. Some of it may have a sliver of reality in the sense that the person had to think of it, I'll give you that, but who gives a shit? People are not guilty for their thoughts."
dcoxjtj,nanou_2,"You're comparing apples and oranges.Standup comedy is understood to generally be over the top fiction, or at the least the subject of over the top embellishment.Trump wasn't on a stage, nor was he in a situation where he and the audience had an expectation of humor and hyperbole. And this isn't about thoughts. The statements Trump made that are being referred to here were inadvertantly recorded while he was miked for an interview and the mike hadn't been turned off. He was speaking to one person, essentially bragging about being an *active* pursuer of pretty women, how he can't help himself, and how his celebrity status essentially lets him get away with sexual assault.Further, this man is not comedian! He's the president. He sets the tone for his administration, and obstensibly represents the interests of every person in this country, not just the minority of the country's citizens that voted him into office.But this kind of behaviour is routine for him. If it wasn't ""funny"" to some people, and if it wasn't so often excused the way you're excusing it, it would be far, far easier for the huge number of people he's criminally mistreated to prosecute him.Trump stands on incredibly unequal footing to many people he abuses in one form or another, being a rich, white, male celebrity. Put yourself in the shoes of a women he came on to, a woman he grabbed in the pussy, and see if you're not shamed to shit by those around you."
dcp6wy8,TheSpreadHead,"1. Was not the President at the time. 2. A HUGE majority have said fucked up things to people in private, that they didn't mean, when they didn't expect it to leave the room. 3. I'm not dismissing anything. I'm giving a completely plausible explanation from the perspective of a regular person."
dcoddx9,awwfishsticks,*begins to laugh as tears roll down face

dcoi5wr,ReynardMiri,Please laugh.
dcocx7o,,He's so fucking r/theredpill I love it!
dcod8l2,nagrom7,"Most people only really heard the ""Grab them by the pussy"" bit. Most places rarely ran the whole clip so it's unlikely most people have seen it unless they went searching for it. Most of them got the general gist of it though, which is more than enough to make Trump look like an asshole."
dcoerg7,AnotherPint,When this tape came to light a few weeks before Election Day it was played -- and the full transcript published -- over and over and over.
dcoex37,DonkeyMcDonkeyPants,I'm not in the US and I saw the clip in full several times on TV.
dcoyeas,Rednaxela1987,"Too much of the coverage for this story was on ""Trump using dirty language"" and not the content of his bragging, you are exactly right."
dcoejk3,1stchairlastcall,"I paid pretty damn close attention during the election cycle, and this is the first time I've seen/heard the entirety of the quote that included everything before the ""Tic Tacs."" Ugh."
dcoh9g8,Tooshortmyass,Then you didn't pay close attention lol
dcohepj,Apocoflips,Seriously I don't know how most concerned or informed people didn't hear this full quote.
dcoi4b8,1stchairlastcall,"OK, buddy. Thanks for your assertion."
dcolxja,Tooshortmyass,It's kind of a fact lol.
dcoin4q,clockworm,"Seriously you jest. The whole clip was played over and over again, both on television and online."
dcoilvc,Boomer70770,Can confirm. First time I saw in its entirety.
dcoigam,Silent_Hysteria,He isn't wrong though..when you are rich and famous...many women and men..will LET you do whatever you want. That's not assault when someone lets you do something...just ask bill Clinton...you can shove cigars in their love canal :). Hell some of the stories from 80s rock bands are insane. Women hitting each other with fish..urinating in litter boxes...just because they were famous
dcolm7n,LikeGoldAndFaceted,It's assault when you grab a woman's pussy without consent whether they report it or not.
dcopanm,Silent_Hysteria,Agreed. But if they LET you do it that means they consented. Just like Bill was let to shove a cigar in someone's vajay jay. But yes all the other times bill did rape assault the others
dcoq1a1,LikeGoldAndFaceted,"It's only not assault if they want you to do it. There's no further distinction needed. ""Let"" is being twisted by rape apologists to mean ""she didn't fight back."""
dcot8m2,Silent_Hysteria,Lol. This coming from the people who were fine with twisting of the definition of sex from bill was. Not a peep from the left on Bill actually raping women....so spare me the indignation because a guy said when you are rich women LET you grope them. Don't hate the playa hate the game
dcouo4i,LikeGoldAndFaceted,"I don't know why you're going on about Bill. Bill hasn't held office for 17 years, dude.Trump didn't say when you're rich women let you grope them, he step by step talked about how he sexually assaulted women. Get off your asinine partisan circle jerk and stop supporting sexual assault."
dcowsl5,Silent_Hysteria,Bill was 17 years ago..17 years the left has had time to condemn him..still they support a rapist and supported his wife who attacked rape victims. And trump did say when your a star women LET you do it. LET means consent. He didnt mean against their will...just more spin while ignoring their own rapists...exactly why Polanski and woody Allen are LW icons
dcoxypu,LikeGoldAndFaceted,Lol you're fucking delusional.
dcp03qb,Silent_Hysteria,So you deny Bill is a rapist and Hillary threatened the women raped? You are saying the rape victims are liars? That's why so many women don't report it..because evil people say they are lying. Always believing the man..shame
dcohkeb,theGUYishere24,"As a man, I've said a hell of a lot worse in candid conversations, don't pretend that you haven't too. We're all hoomans who make mistakes. You're just blind to yours."
dcoi1u0,SoloKMusic,"I've said crude things, but as a man--no, as a human being-- I have not said anything as entitled and gross, not to mention criminal if true, things in my life."
dcok0p5,thatssoright,I can't recall bragging that I force myself on someone the second I see them and then laughing about it. Of course that's because I don't sexually assault people under cover of being famous so they must want it.
dcojqio,Supersquishy,"I've never bragged, nor have I ever sexually assaulted anyone. Maybe you have."
dcoiq87,clockworm,"Well, I guess that makes you worse than Trump, only you're not rich."
dcolnm8,LikeGoldAndFaceted,So you've bragged about sexually assaulting women in private?

dcovi0v,nagrom7,I'm a man and I sure as fuck haven't bragged about sexually assaulting women.
dcocjd7,pissbum-emeritus,I'm afraid they are dead serious. Our soon-to-be inaugurated president spoke those words.
dcocvg0,,Knowing he was mic'd.
dcoel0j,pissbum-emeritus,Totally brazen and without an iota of shame or remorse.
dcofikm,wwlink1,"Jfk said swim over of me with your mouth open to a young 16 year old girl who was his student secretary. She was abused and wrote a book about it. Yet Americans praise Jfk, clinton, etc as perfect people. Most of your leaders have done worse and have not been as open."
dcog8hf,Dolphlungegrin,"Oh, I didn't know JFK did it, it's all good now. Pack it in everyone, time to go home JFK did it too."
dcohumb,wwlink1,Considering jfk was considered a prolific and admired president I think it says lots that people held him to high standards and regards. Yet did a lot of shady stuff. Would you cast trump and jfk in the same boat?
dcon8f1,Fairhur,"If JFK did that today, his hardcore opponents would crucify him, his hardcore supporters would excuse him, and it would sway some of his reluctant opponents/supporters. Just like Trump.Edit: If you're going to try to use grownup words, you might want to look up ""prolific""."

dcoe6fn,saposmak,"False equivalency. The argument is about consent, not the lewdness of the act."
dcoeni2,que_xopa,Yeah but he had tic tacs sooo.... what's there to consent?
dcoi8b9,ReynardMiri,I can't tell if that is sarcastic or not.
dcoigxg,que_xopa,"You're right, it totally depends on what flavor tic tacs."
dcoelac,FesteringAids,Then why was she trying to get back at him all these years. Liberals want to bitch and gripe about every little thing. I don't remember once any conservative rallies blocking highways or threatening to leave the country when Obama was elected. Get over yourselves.
dcofvc2,Maulie,"http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3421585It is the first thing that comes up when you Google it. If it took me 15 seconds of work to find that, I'm sure it's not an isolated event."
dcog420,Thepawesomeone,"Funny...I seem to remember conservatives constantly questioning Obama's birthplace (to the point of claiming his birth certificate was forged), refusing to listen to a single word he said, saying that he was secretly a Muslim who was intentionally destroying the country, and claiming he was everything from Hitler to the antichrist.But no, you're right, legitimate protest of a man who has verifiably done awful things and potentially has ties to a foreign government...that's totally worse."
dcoiwlj,saposmak,"I honestly don't know what you're on about. Sexual assault is not a ""little thing."" You have very selective memory if you don't remember conservative outcry and anger and indignation at the prospect of a black man being their president. There are many reasons Trump is unfit for and undeserving of the presidency. This particular one speaks about the kind of man he is... One that gets what he wants, regardless of whom he hurts, with impunity (mostly because of people like you, who downplay the impact and severity of his actions.)"
dcof0zt,NXTChampion,As if there were any reason to. Get over your own ass and stop acting like Trump deserves the same kind of respect other presidents (conservative and liberal alike) enjoyed.
dcof9w4,FesteringAids,The exact thing could have been said for anti-Obamas but many of them continued their lives for better or for worse. Sorry liberals are so whiny they can't get over themselves and continue their own lives.
dcoi1cz,Thepawesomeone,"I like how when liberals disagree or protest it's whining, but conservatives doing it for eight years is just fine? If we're not ""continuing our lives"", then neither were all of you when you couldn't shut up about how evil Obama was despite him giving no actual reason for you to believe that. I mean you can disagree with him, that's one thing, but ""secret Muslim hellbent on destroying America"" is a smidge further than that."
dcog0j2,NXTChampion,"Yeah, not so much. Obama never behaved in such trashy, ridiculous, dangerous ways, so this false equivocacy bullshit you're pushing isn't gonna fly. It's a simple fact that nothing Obama did in his entire presidency is as dangerous s the things Trump is already doing."
dcoliq9,FesteringAids,Never once did i disrespect Obama. I respect anyone who could take on the role of a president. People need to grow up and go on about their lives instead of complaining about stupid things. Im not saying any sexual assualt is worse than another or that it should be overlooked. This person is your president as well as mine regardless of either of us wanting that or not.
dcolr5e,NXTChampion,"I absolutely accept him as my president, even though I hate it. But to act like people protesting, even in ways considered distasteful, is worse than what this administration could do to this country, is to villainize the wrong people."
dcoehdh,quotey,shouldnt you be watching the inauguration
dcoehyb,pissbum-emeritus,"I guess *that* makes it totally OK we're about to inaugurate a shameless sexual predator as our next president.Gives a new angle to the old saying *Close, but no cigar.*"
dcodtve,JoePrau96,"According to my dad.""At first I was like, 'Oh brother this ain't good. I'm not sure I can vote for him.' Then he came out and owned it. He said 'Yeah that was me, it was a mistake I'm sorry' and what can I say against it? It's a ten year old tape, and he apologized. If I had everything I said held against me 10 years ago I wouldn't have a job.""I think he'd care more if evidence came out of him actually raping a chick, vs him joking about it.I'm not certain, but based on my interactions with other Trump supporters, they don't care about what Trump said a decade ago."

dcoemti,Miguelinileugim,What did he write???
dcoemvh,NAmember81,"It's because the media clings to short, attention-grabbing soundbites and the ""grab em by the pussy"" is the only thing played on repeat over and over. The whole statement doesn't fit into the 3 to 5 second soundbite framework of which the media is constructed. So the ""grab em by the pussy"" soundbite is all that got repeated endlessly. The whole statement was far to long and complex for the attention span of the average American so it rarely got played. You had to deliberately seek it out on YouTube to find it and even then it was mostly edited TMZ-esq coverage of the statement that wasn't complete in its entirety. I thought the part about his victim ""being married"" would have been more damaging to Trump amongst the right-wing base. But of course the word ""**PUSSY**"" was used so that's what got the media spotlight."

dcoijdy,robotsdonthaveblood,"And everyone seems to forget the definition of ""let."" If anything the statement spoke volumes about the kind of unscrupulous women he would hang around if ""they let [him] do anything."""
dcolxsz,Spiralyst,"Conservatives have been groomed for decades to ignore any news not being channeled through a very narrow selection of media. Not read and disagree, mind you, but to ignore it wholesale without learning anything first. It is kind of madness now. Trump called CNN fake news. Have you seen the CNN headquarters? That is quite an establishment for a fake news agency. Meanwhile a ton of the news circulating within pro Trump camps was generated in someone's personal bedroom in some backwater berg, but it was taken S Gospel because it flowed through infowars or Brietbart."

dcomx7z,,"I spoke with my friend's aunt (a Hispanic woman, nonetheless) over the holidays who actually works in an SVU for the LAPD, and she is expressed *absolute disgust* over how many false rape accusations come from women against men; not that she is *pro men's rights* or anything of that nature (she's staunch democrat), she just gets so tired of women lying to her. She sits down with these girls to go over their stories, and at some point trickle-truth comes out because their story doesn't make sense and they breakdown and say they made it all up for one reason or another. Of course she also had very sad stories of actual rapes (usually children/teens who are sexually assaulted by family members), but she said she gets more false rape reports than not. So is it any surprise that as a society people are skeptical? The skepticism is coming from somewhere.A lot of women probably didn't see a problem with Trumps remarks. A lot of women probably felt that, ""Ya. If a celebrity grabbed me, I might actually like it. It's validation. A powerful man wants me."" Other's don't agree, obviously, but the sentiment is out there."
dconh16,,[deleted]
dcou11r,,"It goes both ways. A woman who accuses Trump of sexual assault may in fact not understand consent either. It isn't just men who don't understand consent. I don't doubt that Trump grabbed women. But grabbing women in itself is not sexual assault. People are grabbing one another all the time in bars and nightclubs. It's only unwanted grabbing that is sexual assault. Trump was insinuating that when he grabs women it is not unwanted because he is a star, and women actually consent to his advances - there is probably a lot of truth in this. The fact that they may feel badly 20 years later about the encounter does not make it sexual assault. It just makes it a feeling of regret. And regret does not translate to sexual assault or rape. And usually in all cases, it is he'said-she-said. No one is protesting he-said-she-said cases. How could you? You don't know the truth. Nor is anyone protesting brutal rapes because they are so obviously wrong. So what are people protesting?"
dcoxe12,TonyExplosion,"So I can do this to women in the supermarket or on the street now? I mean, I'm a semi-handsome male. And it's not like they could say no before I just reach out and grab their hoo-hah. So that makes it automatically not sexual assault. Because they would obviously want it and if they didn't they would have somehow stopped me before I did it. Does this extend to dudes? I mean if I get punched that is physical assault. They didn't stop me from grabbing them in the junk so obviously they wanted it. So it wasn't sexual assault that I'm getting assaulted over.Cool."
dcoyu3z,,"You will have more success than a 300 lb homeless man, but you'll have less success than Donald Trump. I'm trying to understand *why* Donald Trump got elected given the nature of the complaints against him. This would have sunk anyone else, but I think the fact that he is a celebrity he was able to brush it off because, well, this is how celebrities act, and he was never trying to act all pious like anyone else would. There's also an amount of respect for so called *alpha males* even if they behave badly. I mean, Bill Clinton is an example, whose settled claims with his accusers. One woman accused him of sexual assault, only later to be discredited by multiple people that it was entirely consensual and she was very happy and excited about the encounter (wow, another shocker - a woman being excited about being ""groped"" by a very powerful and handsome man). Him staring at the now First Lady biting his lip is now on the front page, and everyone finds it so hilarious. This place has moral schizophrenia is seems."
dcomdf0,Sabuleon,"Trump doesn't know sexual assault is wrong, and a certain portion of the electorate think sexual assault is not a big enough deal / isn't wrong enough to avoid voting for someone like him.Therefore yeah we certainly do need to keep protesting this kind of crap.

dcp0g11,,"I don't mean this sarcastically or hypothetically, but couldn't it also be considered baffling that women, and especially ones with daughters, supported Hillary Clinton whose husband was accused of sexual assault and even settled claims with some of his accusers? What message does that send when your husband commits sexual assault and multiple adulteries but yet you still remain with him? It reeks of politics and opportunism. It sends the message, ""If your husband is powerful, you stay with him so you can advance yourself, even though he is a terrible husband."""
dcoj7ns,,A lot of women unfortunately are pretty misogynistic. In some cases they're harder on their own sex than men are.
dcoxixv,,"When you see the way some men talk about women, if you separate yourself from women it's a way for you to attempt to get the same respect from men that they give to other men.Most women (myself included) go through a phase like this. It usually ends when you realize that those types of men will never see you as a human first, as well as realizing that most women don't actually conform to the shitty stereotypes you have about them in your head. To those types of men you're always a woman first, human second. And no matter how much you shit on your own gender they will not respect you like they do a man.Internalized misogyny makes me sad as hell."

Calling Trump a misogynist and guilty of sexual assault based on the transcript of what he said in that tape is idiotic. Nowhere in the tape does admit to sexual assault. Last I checked, if an adult LETS (which is precisely what he said) you perform a sexually-suggestive act on them that does not constitute sexual assault.But that would go against the prevailing narrative that Trump is Hitler incarnate."

I've noticed, oddly enough, that many women who voted were voting also for issues that are not purely woman-centric, as if they self identify as more than just a double X chromosome. I'll have to look into this more. It is possible that explaining how women and cubans voted for Trump is similar to explaining how whites did, or the 9% of African Americans who did, or the various LGBT people who did like Trump's good buddy Caitlin Jenner. That's the thing I think folks on the left don't always realize. A person's race or sexual identity does not define everything about them. Every person is a snowflake, unique and beautiful in their own ways, even those people who think unlike they are supposed to."

But when Trump displays both sexist rhetoric and action towards women as a group or block, it seems that every woman voting would be alarmed. Then we add the fact that Trump's opponent was the first woman to win a major party's nomination and therefore could have been the country's 1st female president.

Would they value their political identity over their identity as a woman if it meant losing the right to vote? Obviously not or they wouldn't be voting in the first place.

Stowe wrote that slavery not only produces ""degraded, miserable slaves"", but also poor whites who are even more degraded and miserable. The plantation system forced those whites to struggle for subsistence. Beyond economic factors, Stowe traces this class to the shortage of schools and churches in their community, and says that both blacks and whites in the area look down on these ""poor white trash"".[11]How in the hell is white trash not a racial slur?"

Since the witness's answer will rely on an out-of-court statement that Susan made, Susan is not available for cross-examination, and it is to prove the truth that Tom was in town, it is hearsay. A justification for the objection is that the person who made the statement is not in court and thus is insulated from cross-examination. Note, however, that if the attorney asking the same question is not trying to prove the truth of the assertion about Tom being in town but the fact that Susan said the specific words, it may be acceptable. For example, it would be acceptable to ask a witness what Susan told them about Tom in a defamation case against Susan because now the witness is asked about the opposing party's statement that constitutes a verbal act.[1][2]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearsay>When it's not at all such a blatant confession...If you have beef with how other people are describing it, argue with them. The tape exactly describes the actions taken by Trump in the stories. He doesn't talk, he goes right to kissing them. He grabs their pussies. He described his own actions.I realize people think ""Oh how convenient that they talked about it after the tape came out"" but how the hell would anyone have taken their claims seriously otherwise?

To prove sexual assault you need tangible evidence. You want people to believe they were assaulted by Trump? You need to present facts.

Yes' can be taken away, ""let"" means nothing, etcetc.I'm more arguing with the idea that ""let"" implies consent especially considering what the women are saying. I'm not arguing the greater definition of consent. >Yes, consent is a very slippery slope - it's a difficult thing to quantify. However, the far left put a fence up and quantify damn near anything as not ""real"" consent. Ffs, you can take back consent long after the consented action takes place.Which isn't happening in this case. What's amazing to me is that you're arguing that there was consent strictly based on what Trump said. That these women deny there was consent apparently doesn't affect how you view it.Honestly, why is Trump's word more valid to you than that of these women?>The fact that you're trying to argue a women ""letting"" him do something is rape, with no other information, is just bonkers to me. You have no information to inform a negative position, you just don't like the tone and objectionable / graphic content, so you project that it's not actually consensual. I know, this labels me a bigot and a misogynist because i believe adults *(including women, shocking)* can decide for themselves. Are you kidding? There is other information, there are women who came out and said he assaulted them without their consent. I also didn't call it rape.

dcol4jw,tentwentysix,"Because as they had stated they were not coming forth in order to press charges. In most of the cases the statute of limitations had passed.

Maybe you aren't that kind of woman, but the kind Trump was speaking of, in the CONTEXT of that conversation, do have all kinds of choice. And besides, he said 'start kissing'...ok, maybe he starts with a little kiss on the cheek, and then it advances...and that's where the 'let me' comes in. It's only this generation of millenials that want every step to be a signed consent letter. 11 years ago, it wasn't assumed that consent had to be active. That's new. You don't get to redefine sexual assault for men and women that grew up in a different time. Women SHOULD be expected to be able to say no if they don't welcome the advance. In fact, in sexual harrassment policies, it's a requirement that the women tell the perp 'no'."

Also, men exaggerate to other men about their sexual encounters all the time..like fishing stories. It's just what they do.

Was I assaulted, yeah, maybe, but I said clearly and loudly, 'knock it off', and they did, and I got over it. And like I said, women like Monica purposely go looking to be groped.

Even if the dems are somehow able to get control of enough legislatures, and pass this thing in enough states for it to work, it's going to be a constant tug-of-war. One year, the dems will control the legislatures and pass it, the next year republicans will be in control and repeal it. Rinse and repeat.

dcoorru,DorableOne,"Considering that many states prohibit electors from voting against the popular vote in the state, it can no longer function as it was intended. We either need to let the electors vote as they wish or do away with the Electoral College."

dcok0s1,ChickenDelight,"They absolutely didn't expect it to last this long. At the end of the Constitutional Convention, George Washington said, “I do not expect the Constitution to last for more than 20 years.” Today, it's the oldest written constitution in the world. It would blow their minds that it lasted more than two centuries, treated like a pseudo-religious document in a sci-fi world they couldn't being to grasp.Why didn't the Framers plan for massive shifts in demographics and technology and culture? Because why would they? They were just putting out the beta model, that was their grandkids' problem ^along ^with ^the ^slavery ^thing."
dcoglrl,tumbler_fluff,"They did. The Constitution only mandates that the electoral college exists; it is entirely up to the states how they wish to distribute their votes. This takes that power out of the federal government and puts it in the hands of the states and closer to the people. If, for example, states wanted to distribute their electoral votes proportionally to the candidates actual winning percentage, or join the [National Vote Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact), they can do that. Additionally, the Constitution was designed to be changed. It's not amended often but it has been several times in the past, and if the national will is strong enough to dump the EC, we can do that too."
dcoh2v6,kescusay,"The compact is a good idea, but several red and/or swing states would need to join it, and as long as the Republican party keeps successfully pulling the wool over the eyes of their voters, that won't happen. Neither will a constitutional convention."

dcokmjs,Joe_Redsky,"It's true there were no European governments as democratic as what the founding fathers proposed, but it has been well established that they borrowed heavily from the federal constitution of the Iroquois Confederacy and other indigenous nations. The concept of the supremacy of the individual over the state was well established in indigenous constitutions but virtually unknown in Europe outside of radical intellectual circles."
dcomqt1,jesus_zombie_attack,That's why I specifically said the west. Tribal society's definitely were more democratic. Even the norse /Vikings were.
dcomz5g,Joe_Redsky,"I find the ""tribal"" reference confusing and unnecessary. The Iroquois were no more ""tribal"" than Europeans. Although modern history tends to assume that the colonists saw themselves as superior to the indigenous nations, that's not really the case. There are many documented cases of 17th century colonists moving to permanently live in the relatively more prosperous and freer indigenous societies."
dcop8b1,jesus_zombie_attack,I think you are arguing unnecessarily about semantics. I'm talking about warrior society's. I'm not using that term to disparage any social advancement they don't have.
dcophw1,Joe_Redsky,"Could be, and I'm not disagreeing with anything you posted, but I'm indigenous and kinda sensitive about the word ""tribal"" often being used as a synonym for ""primitive"". All societies are tribal at their core."

dcolahu,onebigstud,"Exactly. You have regional representation. Every person should have an equal vote for any office that represents them. The president represents EVERY American, so every American should have an equal vote for the President. Senators represent their state, so every member of their state should have an equal vote for that senator. Representative represent everyone in their district, so every member of that district should have an equal vote for that representative. The electoral college would be better if it wasn't winner take all, but it's still an archaic system that should be eliminated."
dcoj9qp,Frozen_Esper,"Instead, we now have a Tyranny of the Minority, where a candidate can win an election by -2.8 million votes. The states that most interface with the international community get shit representation in an election that has extreme international impact. In the reverse of your statement about ""LA vs Nebraska"", should the top economy of the country, top population, and most diverse/internationally connected state have to listen to the will of Nebraska, just because nearly 3 million extra voices get fudged into irrelevance?"
dcoizpa,Smith_Dickington,"Then the question becomes, what's ""fairly""?"
dcojtn2,,Right you are. I think lower population states may be slightly over represented with the current system but going to the pure popular vote goes way too far the opposite direction in my opinion. There is a direct correlation between intelligence and having fewer children. Intelligent people wait to have children and have far less children on average. So by switching to a pure popular vote we'd (over time) be handing power over the average American idiot. There needs to be a balance between population and states representation.
dcokl8b,neilthedude,Wtf are you talking about? The electoral college somehow gives smart people more leverage?
dcolgk6,Smith_Dickington,"They heard this very argument in Parliament in the 17th century when the levellers were out and about looking to fuck shit up during all the hoo-hah around the Rump collapsing as Cromwell took over. IIANM!Really, it seems like an effort to disfranchis the low-information voter. And the reason democracy itself was greeted with such horror when it was first proposed. It doesn't sound good if you put it in these other ways.EDIT: further clarifications"
dcojdil,MangoMiasma,">People in Los Angeles shouldn't have 100% say over the lives of people who live in Nebraska.Instead, Nebraska has 100% say over the lives of people living in California. Why should arbitrary state lines give some voters more power than others?"
dcokean,SirHyde,"> I don't understand what's so hard to understand about the basic philosophy of the electoral college.It's not hard at all. It's just that the opponents of the EC understand that that philosophy is flawed to its core when we're talking about the current political federal union known as the United States. The US is neither a confederation nor an international organisation (like the European Union, for example). It makes little sense that a federal head-of-state in a presidential republic is elected by land or devolved political entities (states), when said political entities already have their own representatives in the form of senators, governors and local legislatures.> By arguing that we should go by the popular vote alone you're saying that the interior of the country should have absolutely no say in how the country is managed.No, what people are arguing is that every vote should count as much as the other. The interior of the country would continue to have a say in how the country is managed by the principle of one man/woman = one vote. Regardless, this is not a question of silencing voters, since the president can only be ONE individual, therefore some people's say in how the country should be managed will be ignored, but rather it's a question of whether the process should be fair or not. A PV vote is fairer than the current EC arrangement. A STV type of voting would be fairer than both PV and EC. > People in Los Angeles shouldn't have 100% say over the lives of people who live in Nebraska.The argument could be made that people who live in Nebraska also shouldn't have 100% say over the lives of people who live in Los Angeles. The only, problem, however is that neither Nebraskans now Angelenos have 100% say over each other's lives, rather Floridians, Ohioans and North Carolinians do. This election cycle this select group of people who might influence the lives of millions of other people have been joined by Michiganders and Wisconsinites.> It's called the Tyranny of the Majority.Tyranny of the majority is not what you and a lot of other people think it is. It refers to a small majority (littler over 50%) deciding, for example, to remove the rights of the other half. Let's suppose that a majority of 55% in the United States decided that the other 45% should be put in kennels and fed their own faeces. That's tyranny of the majority. It's a problem that arises in direct-democracies, that is why most countries have chosen representative democracies. Talking about such a tyranny in the context of electing the president, or any other kind of representative is downright stupid. There's no other reasonable metric by which we can elect representatives in a democracy.> Every region/state should be represented fairly.I am of the opinion that people, rather than regions, land or territories should be represented fairly."

dcop0aq,raze2012,"1. I'd argue that in a time where ""sea to shining sea"" meant a multi-month expedition across nature, there was a huge difference in fully grasping the idea of managing a populace that large and spread out (a mass far larger than their current settlment, or their English one) vs. an actual implemenation.2. More importantly, I meant more in a technological sense than a social sense (I probably should have just generalized this one to societal growth).The 2nd amendment is one of the clearer examples. For the Electoral College, the increase in the speed of communication and the intellect of the general populace were almost certainly not factors they thought of when establishing the College."
dcolfj4,ModernKender,"Not to mention, the population of educated people was much lower in those days."
dcomty1,DAHFreedom,"That PLUS it was put in place before the time of mass media, so very few people would have had a national following.

dconneb,TheJettage,"My understanding of it in History is that it was a compromise. One that allowed states with Slaves, who counted as a population but couldn't vote, to have a more equal footing with states that weren't primarily slave holding. If you have 100 slaves (3/5 of a person per slave) you would essentially get 60 more population and more say in the national government.

dcoq9x4,sacundim,"When it comes to the motive for the Electoral College, people keep ignoring the elephant in the room: **slavery**.

dcozja7,BooBailey808,"The real issue comes from the fact that the election is first past the post and that the electoral college votes got capped at 538.

For instance, the idea that the EC somehow means that the presidency is awarded by winning a majority of states is another one of the falsehoods conservatives like to spread. It doesn't - you only need to win the 11 most populous states to win the EC. Furthermore, It's not a lack of knowledge in American democracy, it's a fundamental lack of understanding of democracy itself. Maybe it's because living in Europe exposes you to various different systems of government, but the notion that a republic is incompatible with democracy is preposterous. But not as preposterous as the notion that ""American elections are as good as it comes"". Maybe in 1776, when it was the only democracy, but the system today is as outdated as the British colonial rule it replaced was back then."

I'd be hard put to find someone who fits that description better than Trump.>The process of election affords a moral certainty, that the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications. Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity, may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors in a single State; but it will require other talents, and a different kind of merit, to establish him in the esteem and confidence of the whole Union, or of so considerable a portion of it as would be necessary to make him a successful candidate for the distinguished office of President of the United States.[Federalist Papers, No. 68](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp)"

In such a system (ours is a federal constitutional republic, more specifically) power is divided, checked, balanced, and is under no inherent obligation to always represent the public will as you seem to be implying. This is because it is designed for the people to have indirect control of their government. I also said this is sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse. The Electoral College is of course a function of that type of system, though it has been systematically undermined in several states by legally forcing their electors to vote for whomever wins the state and regardless of the distribution of votes."

dcouczq,kescusay,"The disdain you're displaying for the **Americans** who live in California is shocking. That said, I agree that California shouldn't dictate policy to everyone else. Fortunately, we have three branches of government. Only the President is supposed to represent all Americans equally. The houses of Congress and the Supreme Court act as checks and balances."
dcp7k06,YeOldeHobo,"It's no secret that Americans in California are likely to hold political stances that I, and other Americans as the 2016 election demonstrated, find distasteful."
dcp8cy6,kescusay,"But they **are** still Americans. Just as American as you. So why do you feel it's fair that for the one election that affects all Americans, their votes should be worth less than yours?"
dcp8new,YeOldeHobo,"The electoral college shows us that the votes of Americans in California **are** worth more than mine. But, just because that one state overwhelmingly voted contrary to me doesn't mean that Hillary Clinton possesses a golden ticket for the White House. The United States exists beyond vast urban centers."
dcp956o,kescusay,"I'm not talking about the state's overall population, I'm talking about the value of **your** individual vote versus the value of a Californian's. Depending on which state you live in, your vote is worth between two and six times that of a Californian."
dcp9p2x,YeOldeHobo,"Your goal seems to be to demonize me because I observed the fact that Hillary Clinton derived support primarily from metropolitan areas.Yes, my vote can have a larger impact in a smaller state because there are fewer competing votes. Yes, my vote can have a larger impact in a swing state because the content is close. That's not the point. Your original comment states that the majority of voters did not vote for Donald Trump, which I argue is untrue. A difference of seven million votes, or three million according to CNN, does not constitute **most** Americans."
dcpts4t,kescusay,"I have no idea how you can argue that. It's not how math works. Trump got fewer votes than Hillary, who herself didn't get a majority due to people voting third party. Add up the number of votes that Trump received, then subtract that number from the total number of votes cast, and you'll get a number larger than Trump's vote total left over. Ergo, the majority didn't vote for him."
dcqr6tr,YeOldeHobo,"If the difference of 2% constitutes the majority of Americans, then keep whatever math you're peddling. I acknowledge that Hillary Clinton accumulated more votes than Donald Trump. I take issue with your usage of majority, however. EDIT: Added last two sentences."
dcqrj7a,kescusay,"Okay, let's simplify this. There are 20 voters. One candidate gets 8 votes. One gets 9. The other 3 votes go to third party candidates.Did the person who got 8 votes get a majority of the votes? This should be incredibly easy to answer. If the answer is no - and it is - then it should be easy to see that the majority of voters (12 in this analogy) voted for candidates other than the person who got 8. 12 > 8.Now apply it to this election. Trump got X votes. Hillary got Y votes. Other candidates got Z votes total. If Y+Z > X, then the majority of voters didn't want Trump. If Y+Z < X, then the majority of voters wanted Trump.Fill in the values of X, Y, and Z, and you'll have your answer. And if you dispute this, then you are literally arguing against math itself, and that's something you need to take up with your school teachers."
dcqsic9,YeOldeHobo,"The connotation of majority that you are using is the problem, not the math. I recognize the math. But, you seem to be purporting that an overwhelming contingency of Americans voted for Hillary Clinton. That is not the case."
dcqt8al,kescusay,"Indeed, that's not the case. And it's something I never said. Go back and look at my previous comments. I never even tried to make that argument. I have no idea where you got the idea that that's what I was doing. For the entire time, I've only been arguing that Trump 1) didn't get a majority, and 2) that more people voted against him than for him. I never said anywhere that Clinton got a majority. Obviously she didn't, though she got more votes than Trump."
dcqu96j,YeOldeHobo,">Most voters voted against him. Our founding fathers did some great things, but they also gave us an ultimately undemocratic electoral system that unfairly weights the votes of voters in low-population states. They thought they were preventing buffoons like President Annoying Orange from getting into office, but in fact they were guaranteeing it.Here is your OP. My impression from your use of most and your criticism of the electoral college is that you believe, while not stating it explictly, that the popular vote overwhelmingly favors Hillary Clinton, which you and I seem to agree it does not."
dcqv3c8,kescusay,"I wrote ""Most voters voted against him,"" and that's exactly what I meant. You're reading more into that than is there. Of the total number of people who voted, more voted for not-Trump than voted for Trump.Look at the context. My OP was in response to someone saying, ""The whole world collectively thinks less of American citizens because you voted him into office."" I was pointing out that in fact, Trump didn't receive a majority of citizen votes; most of the votes went to someone other than Trump. Then I explained that through an oddity of our undemocratic system, someone who most voters didn't want could become president.Yes, there was the implication that Clinton received more votes than Trump as well, but I don't see a problem with that because the implication is true. She did, in fact, receive a plurality. But I never claimed she received a *majority*. All I claimed was that the majority *didn't* want Trump, for the benefit of an outsider trying to make sense of the bizarre election results."

Remove 90 electors from Trump and 63 from Hillary and Trump still wins.Winner take all as the dominant strategy was all that mattered in securing Trump the nomination. He won the swing states he needed by razor thin margins. This game-theory end point of the electoral college was totally unplanned for by the signers of the constitution.

dcubtj8,kescusay,"I think maybe you have a distorted view of larger areas. Consider California... Right now, it tends to vote about 56% Democrat in presidential elections. If we had a popular vote system, it would mean Democrats could no longer rely on large, population-rich states like California. They would certainly need to campaign there, but suddenly they'd have incentive to try to drum up popular support in all the other states, too. Similarly, Republicans could no longer rely strictly on a coalition of the smaller states to carry elections for them. They'd have reason to go to places like California to drum up as much of the rural Republican vote as they can there, even though they know they're not going to carry the whole state.Right now, if you live in either a deeply red or a deeply blue state, **you don't matter**. The only votes that actually matter are swing state voters. Which is why rather than seeing Republicans in Alabama or Mississippi, you see them in Ohio or New Hampshire - and nowhere else."

It's not a perfect system but at least the voices in Iowa, New Hampshire and such are heard, but honest and truly for a democrat to come to Alabama is pointless. Any way you look at it somebody is gonna be left out. Maybe not because their vote won't count but because there would be no reason to care what people in rural area think because you could go into the greater Atlanta area and lock those votes up and the rest of the state is just out of luck."

The population rich areas would be the only voice heard.*But we can look at other countries that *do* use the popular vote and see that this just isn't how it works out. When every vote is equal, every vote counts. The country is almost evenly divided between rural and urban, which means that no one could possibly win solely by appealing to urban voters.Right now, rural voters have a disproportionately large electoral voice, but they're hurt by the current situation, too. Trump may have done a brief stop in your small town for media optics, but where did he spend the vast majority of his time? In states like Ohio and New Hampshire. In theory, our current system makes sure your voice is heard. In practice, it only makes sure swing states are heard.Plus, rural voters in blue states are currently *completely* disenfranchised, because Republicans don't even bother going there. They know how the state will vote. What about *their* voices? Should rural voters be silenced because they happen to live in Oregon or California?> *It's not a perfect system but at least the voices in Iowa, New Hampshire and such are heard, but honest and truly for a democrat to come to Alabama is pointless.

In state level elections, where one person really does equal one vote, we can clearly see it doesn't work out that way.

Without it, key middle America industry (farming, mining, etc) would be subjected to urban voting and have little say politically. We give them a disproportionate amount of say because political minorities should still have political say. it should not be directly proportional.If you truly believe in popular vote, here is an example of where it fails: In a popular voting system, the 51% majority could vote to liquidate the assets of the 49%, and the 49% would have no say to combat the act.

dcoie3a,Cuckinandshillin,"Well, let's put it this way.....There are certain things that people think should disqualify you from being President...For example, if you were loyalty to another country....or if you were a secessionist (By the way, Rick Perry hinted at it and he's now Secretary of Energy)....I generally feel that being a racist misogynist con-artist should invalidate you from being President.People who voted for him didn't, so they at least condoned his history of prejudice, negative behavior towards women, and questionable business practices.Is condoning discrimination that infinitely different from participating in it?"
dcoqttq,dezolis84,"> Is condoning discrimination that infinitely different from participating in it?I was following you up to this. I can never understand this argument. Like millipedecult was saying, it's the broad brush stroking that needs to be toned down. That's all this is. More broad labeling. Trump and the media obviously got to some people. We need to work to educate. Not label everyone.Hell, I was seeing people shitting on 3rd party voters as well. Some people just vote with their conscience and couldn't stomach voting for Hillary. Doesn't automatically mean they support Trump. It's not just the US, but human beings have some fascination with extremes. Not everything is so damn black and white. There are shades of gray."

The future was looking bright. Science, rationality, and functional government supporting ALL citizens to live in peace was the goal that different sides worked together to achieve.Eisenhower and Nixon were Republicans and helped shape the country towards a brighter future in many ways. But the conservatives were pissed. They didn't want this. They wanted government to force people to live the way they wanted people to live. Many of them wanted *others* to live under their thumb (especially women and minorities). Business interests took advantage of these people to preach a destruction of the power of the American people (i.e. small government).We have been at war, and I didn't get the memo.

Don't let it break or you might have to deal with reality.A large part of the world would have said the same thing if Hillary was elected.Mysandrist Hillary Quotes.""Like it or not, women are always subject to criticism if they show too much feeling in public"" -how is this not a male issue as well?""Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat. Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known. Women are often the refugees from conflict and sometimes, more frequently in today's warfare, victims. Women are often left with the responsibility, alone, of raising the children."" - yeah dead men are not victims, this is perhaps the most vile thing I have heard anyone say about men in war. It blatantly ignores them and makes them a side story in the lives of women. Barely mentioned.""To LGBT men and women worldwide, let me say this: wherever you live and whatever the circumstances of your life, whether you are connected to a network of support or feel isolated and vulnerable, please know that you are not alone."" - If you are a man and feel isolated and vulnerable fuck you because the patriarchy? ""So let's keep going, until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves."" - Is she assuming that every man in America *already* has what they deserve or is this just another indication in an already long line showing she does not care about men?""We will defend all our rights – civil rights, human rights and voting rights… women's rights and workers' rights… LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities!"" -men, ignored again unless they are a worker or disabled, jobless and male fuck you?""Women who want to work deserve to work. And whenever they are denied that opportunity, it's not fair to them – and we all lose out"" - People who want to work deserve to work but we can't miss out on an opportunity to use language to ignore men again!Na I don't need to listen to Hillary anymore when she so obviously doesn't even consider my issues.Here is comment I can get in line with by Chris Hedges.""The Democrats are playing a very dangerous game by anointing Hillary Clinton as their presidential candidate. She epitomizes the double-dealing of the college-educated elites, those who speak the feel-your-pain language of ordinary men and women, who hold up the bible of political correctness, while selling out the poor and the working class to corporate power."" - Turns out enough people listened to this that I don't have to live in fear of 8 years of being ignored, 8 years of continued decline in lifestyle and 8 years of it being harder to help my daughers in life.I also see her in the same light as Edward Klein explains in this quote """"She's the most unbelievable actress I have ever met,"" said a woman who worked on Hillary's Senate campaign. ""I remember one time at a Women's Leadership Forum event in New York, thirty of us sat around Hillary, talking about politics. And she said, 'You know, I love this organization, not just because we sit around and talk about politics, but because of the bonds of friendship forming around us.' The way she said it, people were riveted by her performance. But I had gotten to know her, and I could tell she didn't mean it. She has this unbelievable ability to be a liar. She is soulless.""Or perhaps we should listen to Abby Martin when she says ""As a woman, I completely reject Hillary's brand of bourgeois feminism because it leaves out millions of immigrant women, poor women, and the women under her bombs around the world."" I mean they both ignore men but at least Abby is a step ahead of HillaryAlso the protect women bullshit is just what they say it is when it comes out of Hillarys mouth as explained in this quote by Kathleen Willey ""Hillary Clinton is the war on women. And I think that she needs to be exposed for all of the terror campaigns that she's raised against women who were in the wrong place at the wrong time with her husband. And it's been going on since before they were married. That's how she handles it…The easiest way for her to handle scandals is to ruin the women who just happen…to cross paths with him. And that's horrible, and they do a good job at it.""Let me end this with another Hillary quote that showed her bias over 20 years ago.""If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all.""Hillary Clinton - ignoring men and mens issues for over 20 years!I don't agree with much of what Trump says and much of who he is, but at least I am in the conversation. I don't get ignored and indeed silenced for being a man like so many of her supporters do."

dcoijpp,NothingsShocking,"I am American and I actually have no problem with Duterte unlike so many people who I think don't really get the point. Duterte as the President of the US would be bad. Duterte as the President of the Phillipines, he is needed. While I agree human rights and due process of law is essential in any first world country, in a third world, poor country that is overrun by drugs and crime, you have to take a hard stance. Problem with most leaders of third worlds is that they are corrupt and don't bother trying to fix the problem, in fact most of them are in on it. Just imagine if Duterte was President of Mexico for a second. It would be a game changer. Kill anyone selling drugs. It's that simple. I will send in my Marines and kill the fuck out of anyone selling drugs, I don't have time for bullshit, if you use drugs and get killed, well it's collateral damage, sorry, fuck you, drugs = die. I promise you, the Cartel problem would be diminished SIGNIFICANTLY. It is one of those does the ends justify the means, well yes. Do you know how many innocents die everyday in Mexico at the hands of the Cartels? The Cartels run the fucking country for christsakes. I applaud Duterte. Do your thing man.

dcoidos,Sklushi,In the video he says they let him
dcoiaqw,SaitoHawkeye,"OP didn't say he did it.OP said he ""Boasted of doing it.""Which is completely accurate to the tape.

No one can prove he did it (many have alleged he did), but he freely admitted to it and boasted about it on a hot mic."

I'll try to oversimplify it for you: If I touch your body without getting your permission, my reasons for touching you don't matter.

Without it, you basically have cave man times (or really any time before the 1960s), where big strong people force everybody else to do whatever stupid thing comes to mind."
dcorkwu,Sklushi,Again: No proof. You don't get to dictate what it means to be sexually assaulted.I'll try to oversimplify it for you:If no has no proof about man touching woman without her consent than man legally did nothing wrong
dcorz2y,,"[Sexual Assault already has a definition](https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault), I don't need to define it.

dcohabt,hedgeowl,"I know this is a faint hope to grasp at, but when I read this conversation (and I have read it, and listened to it, 50 times by now), it sounds like the words of a socially boneheaded 12-year-old who has never touched a vagina in his life and doesn't know how to hold a conversation unless it's about how cool he thinks he is. As if maybe the furniture story is the only real part of it.This doesn't make it any less disgusting.

We are dumb, and sexually driven."
dcolrt6,foreveraskier,"The conversation is him admitting to sexual assault. The reason people are upset is that it isn't just locker room talk. There was action involved on other occasions.

dcoux0y,WutangCND,Listen to what your saying. You're making things up. When did I say it was acceptable? It literally has to be physical to be assault.

I was merely inquiring about the situation as I don't know anything about it. Go back to your safe space.

dconlqi,lolrpizzajeez,"Anonymous surveys, perhaps?"
dcp63k1,potentialnamebusines,"Also just phrasing differently when asking. It's:""Have you ever been sexually assaulted and/or raped"" vs ""have you ever been penetrated sexually without consent?/have you ever been made to penetrate someone sexually without consent?""More people are willing to respond to the latter questions because it doesn't have the same social connotations. So imagine that the second question is on a sexual health survey or a health intake form at the doctor? That sexual assault isn't necessarily reported to authorities for conviction.That's one of the ways to get the unreported stat."
dcoojzb,plz2meatyu,I dunno. Good question.

dcoiumx,6sshesdxc,"Oh no Trump thinks rape is a problem, I would've never voted for him if I knew he is against rape."
dcojtzj,,"No, the assumption of the Trumpian Weasel Mind is that rape is a natural response to men and women being together. Do you want to rape women when you are near them? If so, you, like Trump, need help."
dcokypb,ShureYnaut,"That is the exact same belief behind Sharia Law, which they claim to hate"
dcomn6u,je35801,"You probably didn't notice, but I think there might be some gray in between your black and white."
dcoo2z1,ShureYnaut,Not really in his case. Let's take this maxim for consideration to simplification:Men inherently have a natural tendency to rape women.Both parties defend that maxim.It's a great example of Horseshoe theory where two diametrically opposed extremists tend to me more like each other than they are like the moderates who are closer to the center of the political spectrum
dcp0pmp,Aenonimos,"What do you mean by ""natural response"", and why do you think that's what Trump meant? If I understand you correctly, it seems like you think Trump expects rape to happen because ""that's what he'd do"" or something along those lines. It's a statistical fact that rape happens in situations like that. You don't have to be a rapist or a misogynist to expect other people to do so. Just because you expect behavior, doesn't mean you condone it. So it's unfair to make that conclusion about Trump.In reality, he could have been thinking that something obviously needs to be done about the situation (like training the men in some manner, more follow up on reported cases, etc.). You can't just assume he meant the solution should be to remove women from the military.This is why people say the media is biased."
dcppp8b,6sshesdxc,He never said that. You are the one making outrageous assumptions here. Do you think you can fix a problem by ignoring it? Rape will always happen no matter what you think about it. To fix it you need to make it a choice a person will not want to make. Low IQ people in the army who are a long time without sex will have a lot higher risk of raping someone so it's only natural you need to regulate that area more carefully.
dcojuvg,Tvayumat,And that rape is just what happens when men and women spend time together.Charming.
dcppfqv,6sshesdxc,"In these very specific conditions. Unfortunate, but true."
dcol97f,autranep,I love how Trump supporters apparently can't see the problem with assuming that rape is natural result of putting men and women together.
dcom9v3,chefcj,They have to be missing the point on purpose.

dcoxobb,,That is some sexist ass shit. You have a terrible view of men
dcp3cy1,,The sexist one would be you. You obviously mean put men and women together would make men rape women when we all know that some sexual assault and rape happen with women as the perpetrator. Men aren't the only ones doing the raping.
dcp3qvu,,"That's incredibly true. Women do rape men.I was replying to implication of Trump's tweet. No matter who perpetrates the rape, it's an incredibly sexist statement to make.I will add that in Trump's ""macho"" utopia there would be little to no support for male victims of rape.

dcoi3sz,ChiefDutt,"Alright I'm really against what he said, but I was on a lot of sports teams in high school and that's exactly what my basketball team talked about in the locker room. Not all the time, and not everybody, but some of the worst guys definitely did."

dcoj7vx,TheDungeonCrawler,"Would you want any of those ""worst"" running the country?"
dcojqjj,ChiefDutt,No I wouldn't. I'm just saying that the more we randomly say things about him that aren't true the easier it is to call anything we say fake news. Call him out but be honest.
dconwax,womanwithoutborders,I find it hard to believe that most men boast about sexual assault in locker rooms.
dcoo46d,MikeHot-Pence,"Having been on two sports teams in high school and the Army since then, never heard anything so crass as the quote above."

dcoq4xu,ChiefDutt,"It's not most men. It's a really small number of men, but when people say nobody does it's not true. Almost no one talks like that but some people do. That's all I'm trying to say"
dcoqezq,womanwithoutborders,"Right, I hear ya, but then you shouldn't be allowed to call it ""locker room talk"". That phrasing implies that disgusting statements like the one he made are the norm in locker rooms."
dcom4ol,BoilerMaker11,"Are you sure that's *exactly* what your team talked about in the locker room? Sexually assaulting women? Or merely objectifying them? Objectifying is just words, at the end of the day. Boasting about sexual assault is talking about *actions* you've done."
dcoo7w7,MikeHot-Pence,"This is the crux. There's a world of difference between boasting of things you've done and implying this is your personal philosophy on sexuality, and saying ""oh, what I wouldn't do to her."" The latter is innocent pining and lust. The former is admitting to a pattern of miscreant behavior."
dcoqc6t,ChiefDutt,"I mean I remember one time a guy talked about grabbing a girl's chest, so yeah. I'm not trying to normalize it. I thought it was disgusting then, I think it's disgusting now, but some people do talk like that. Also Trump said that he could grab them by the pussy.

dcoowir,Circumin,"I've been on sports teams and in lock rooms and I've heard talk, but never bragging about sexually assaulting women. It's not the words but the assault aspect that is so appalling."
dcomnlu,BossaNova1423,"This. Yeah, most men obviously don't say stuff like that no matter how close they are to a locker room, but there is definitely a significant minority who do. People who said ""I don't know any men who would say something like that"" are almost certainly wrong. But of course, one of those men who say that shit shouldn't be running the country."

dcophyk,1brokenmonkey,"Same, we all joked about other shit, and bullied each other, but we never talked about girls all that much. Probably because the last thing on our minds in a locker room of half naked smelly dudes is women. You're free to interpret that as you wish."
dcovzbj,rediKELous,"I see some people disagreeing with you below, and I'll chime in with something that I saw in another discussion. It seems like there is a big difference between ""locker room talk"" in normal public schools and the talk in privileged schools. Seems like more of what you and I experience in the public school realm, stopping at ""man she's hot, I love her tits, I'd bang the shit out of her"", and more of the ""I just grabbed her by the pussy"" Donald talk at the high-class schools."
dcp0pyl,Psycho_historian_8,"Late comment but this is what I never understood, his excuse was ""locker room talk"" but I played sports all the way through college and nobody ever bragged about rape/sexual assault.

dcox8aq,,"That's BS> Sexual assault is a sexual act in which a person is coerced or physically forced to engage against their will, or non-consensual sexual touching of a person. Sexual assault is a form of sexual violence, and it includes rape (such as forced vaginal, anal or oral penetration or drug facilitated sexual assault), groping, child sexual abuse, or the torture of the person in a sexual manner.[1][2]In legal terms, sexual assault is a statutory offense in various jurisdictions, including the United States, Canada, England and Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. The legal definition of the crime of sexual assault is determined by each jurisdiction. Specific legal jurisdictions and research often use highly technical or detailed definitions of the termhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault"
dcoecp2,AnastasiaBeaverhosen,"He absolutely did say it, but this is a shitty headline. It's like saying ""man goes to racist pastor for years, later gets inagurated president."" Every presidential candidate has some bullshit in the campaign, it doesn't have to define them."
dcoejs4,Gritsandgravy1,It does define him though. Given how he's handled himself over the years he his absolutely that guy.
dcoes9i,hazmat95,"Man receives sermon from anti-semetic pastor, is sworn in as president later that day. How's that?"

dcolgov,zipperpeeper,"> CoercingNo evidence he coerced anyone. You are again assuming things that probably never happened. As I mentioned in my other comment, I work with billionaires and I know their life. Women like to have sex with them and it's nothing secret. I just don't get why people like to pretend money and power don't make someone attractive."

dcp088h,zipperpeeper,That's your evidence? Really?
dcoghgf,Potato13579,"No it doesn't. ""Yes"" is consent. ""Let"" implies Trump is rich and powerful and you're too afraid to try and stop him."
dcohjlo,zipperpeeper,"The reason for which you grant permission for sexual contact doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is that it's not against your will and you give permission for it. ""Yes"" isn't a magic word. Context and body language matter as well. > Let (v.) to allow something to happen or someone to do something by giving permission"
dcoirov,Potato13579,"If a mugger points a weapon at me and asks for my wallet, I'm going to *let* him have it. Letting him have it doesn't mean I wanted him to take it and that he didn't actually rob me. It just means I didn't want to put up a fight and put myself in further danger."
dcoj6et,zipperpeeper,You're going to the extremes and discussing a case that's completely different. Pointing a gun and threatening are separate crimes themselves. That's not what he did. You just don't want to accept that women like to have sex with powerful and rich men. The same is true for men.
dcokwsk,Potato13579,"You don't know what he did. The point is that simply because they ""let"" him do it doesn't mean there was consent.You just don't want to accept the fact that women are often too scared to say no to rich and powerful men."
dcol7dn,zipperpeeper,"It doesn't mean there wasn't one either, so it's irresponsible to call it ""sexual assault"" when there is no evidence to support such claim. Do you go around in the streets asking people who walk together if they had consented? No, because you just assume everyone is innocent unless they are proven guilty. The same is not true for Trump. The media likes to paint him as guilty every time."
dcolgqk,Potato13579,"If I go up to someone on the street grab their genitals (which is essentially what Trump described himself doing), I've assaulted them.Stop defending sexual assault just because you like Trump."
dcoljq9,zipperpeeper,"No if they give permission to you to do it, it's not sexual assault."
dcolpbt,Potato13579,"But once again, they didn't give permission."
dcom2ot,zipperpeeper,How do you know they didn't? Were you there?
dcozviz,Aenonimos,This is a sad debate to watch. That conversation would have never happened if Trump was a rockstar getting tones of groupies.
dcoirvm,Theone198,"""The reason for which you grant permission doesn't matter"" ""it's not rape if she said yes just because I threatened her if she didn't"" Also, just because it's 'legal' doesn't mean it's less disgusting, or creepy, or misogynistic to say"
dcoj2l3,zipperpeeper,Threatening is completely different. He never threatened anyone.
dcok5wq,Theone198,Is that not what he implied? The wording is that because he's powerful and rich and famous there's no option to say no- not that far from a threat lol
dcol143,zipperpeeper,What do you mean they had no option to say no? Where's your source? Just because someone is rich and powerful does not mean people don't say no to them. Also I work with billionaires worth 5 times Trump in Beverly Hills. Most of the time it's the women going after the billionaires because they are attracted to their power and money. I don't get why it's so hard to admit that money is attractive and people like to have sex with rich people?
dcoivop,rtomek,"Exactly, it's a clickbait headline. I guess it's a ""liberal"" bias in that it goes against a republican, but even as a liberal I see through it. Everybody knows that many women fall for celebrities and would fuck them in an instant, it's not sexual assault if the women wants it just as much as the man. This is like saying that Clinton sexually assaulted Monica Lewinski."
dcohdvt,wh0dey937,Man boasts of drug use and is later inaugurated POTUS. That's really gonna help put all of this behind us.
dcoizir,robotsdonthaveblood,"He absolutely said it. He said the kind of woman he hangs around are so horny for stardom that they're willing to let stars do whatever the star wants to do to them. Everyone seems to miss the part of his statement where it's the woman allowing this shit to happen. The quote is ""they let you do anything."" Think about it for a moment. Does it make Trump any less of a scumbag? Absolutely not. However, if the woman allows it calling it sexual assault is disingenuous."
dcojlim,mschwartz33,It's bias when we are seeing the same criticism from during the campaign while the Democrats propped up a candidate with a long history of covering up and silencing the many sexual assault victims of her husband. Where was the care for abused women then? Certainly nothing that Trump did or said is admissible but I am sick of only finding the criticism when it services a particular political leaning.
dcomxiw,I_HaveAHat,Did he sexually assaulted anyone though? No? Then the title is clickbait bullshit

Sure, you might have seen the same post a dozen times in the past 3 months, but maybe it's because checking the subreddit every 2 hours daily for content means you are going to burn out on novelty more readily than the daily new visitors.Also, we have communities for a reason. They contribute the content, vote on it, comment on it and debate it in the classic tradition.Moderation to excess creates stifled cultures of elitism that serve nothing resembling their mission statements. It's the French ministry that makes it illegal to use Email in french, because it is not significantly french enough to warrant usage. No, you must use *electronic communique*. Or, a fucking email."
dco8hx1,Edg-R,I wish this subreddit had some rules.
dco8ixd,Psyladine,Read the sidebar.
dco9bqb,Tuffology,Fuck Paywalls though...
dcod6v4,MissRavenXxX,"Excuse my ignorance, but what are Paywalls?"
dcoe4br,lifesbetterbackwards,"It's when you have a delay to enter a site, and are prompted to pay a subscription fee to access the website's content. Like a wall, that makes you pay!"

dcojmrn,,"> Ohhh ok. I've come across that plenty, just ~~had no clue about the nickname.~~ made the Mexicans pay for those walls.I see you Trump, I see you. >.<"
dcok85s,MissRavenXxX,"Tremendous job, nukeshooter. Just tremendous. It's not easy to find me, believe me. It's because I know words and I have the best words. I'm, like, a really smart person."
dco6px1,MTGPeter,[This](http://www.angelfire.com/extreme4/safer_sephiroth/EVERY_WORD_EVER.htm) is the actual list of all topics you are **not** allowed to post about in /r/nottheonion
dco6ywo,billthomson,"Yeah, the one that got me was something really funny that got blocked because of paywall, so I found another link that met their criteria & it got manually deleted about 2 hours later (with a load of upvotes and about 60 comments) because it wasn't the original source."
dco792i,RittledIn,That's stupid
dco7f20,billthomson,"It's their sub & they can run it however they want, but after that experience I gave up on them."
dco81lq,TundraWolf_,Great way of killing your sub honestly. I've given up on a few because of impossible submitting rules.
dco93e0,f_d,They seem to be doing okay. High volume subs get more than enough rule-abiding submissions to make strict submission rules a net positive if the alternative is a chaotic mess. r/science has stricter rules than most and still makes the front page all the time.
dcoc695,selfiereflection,Their mods are fucking cancer though. Half the time the rules are only enforced at the discretion of whatever mod is looking at the post. Messaging them goes nowhere as they just circle around the issue and stop responding. Plus you can get your post removed and/or banned for rules not on the list. Again at 100% discretion of whatever the mod in particular decides.
dcocknk,f_d,So it's Reddit?
dcoedva,selfiereflection,Yes but there aren't that many larger subs of a general nature which are that cancerous. Hell even as much as I bitch about r/politics the mods are reasonable 90% of the time. I even got banned from history last week due to a mod crossover disagreeing with me. Being muted when you asked why you got banned from a major subreddit is really shitty.Using alts to circumvent subreddit bans can get you sb'd but I feel that rule needs to be looked at. I don't want to be locked our of a major sub due to some random person going on a power trip. The mods truly run this website.
dco99mk,,"I've been flagged for not using the original source and having part of a redirect link attached. When it's 8 minutes between posting, why should I sit there for a half-hour trying to get it up? They really have made it way too hard to post and I've told the mods this. How the fuck am I supposed to find the regular source? And there's pages not newsy enough. Fuck them."
dco8v7l,bankerman,"I love the ones that make you flair your post even though it's impossible to do so in the iOS Reddit app. What, they actually expect me to use a desktop?"
dcor34b,RittledIn,Those drive me insane cause I exclusively use iOS to browse Reddit.

dcorphs,TrumpsGoldShower,"> The fact is, which you implicitly agreed with, this sub does remove posts that are popular and have a large number of discussions.I figured you were trying to make an actual point, like they are censoring certain topics even though they are popular.If your point is actually that they just delete popular posts sometimes, so fucking what? You claim there is the potential for bias, and sure, that is a potential. But your job should be to show it, I don't give a shit if there is a potential for bias if there is none.>That post was removed for breaking Rule #6, needs to be an article, video, or sound clip. That is entirely too vague and unreasonable. How is that vague? That example you gave is not by any definition an article. It was not written by a journalist to discuss some topic or to detail an event. It is an email that was given a web page.>Not only that, but mega threads are never a legitimate reason to lock down or remove a post. Megathreads are where discussions go to die. I agree, but again, this goes back to the whole bias thing. Show some bias or I don't really care. And in this particular case, I know there is no bias because they put the trump dossier discussions into a megathread. If anything, if they had some kind of anti-trump bias, they would have let that shit sit all over the front of /r/all."

The entire half of that fucking article that directly relates to trump and his sexual assault was ignored by you so you could claim it violates a rule that it doesn't."
dcovkyy,,[deleted]
dcovsef,TrumpsGoldShower,">I omitted one sentence, Yeah, fuck you. a man who is on the record, in his own words, describing how he sexually assaulted a woman. Too many who heard that story remembered his boast that he could do whatever he wanted, grab women “by the pussy,” but they missed the rest of his quote, in which he explicitly describes sexually assaulting a married woman:“I did try and fuck her. She was married… I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she's not got the big phony tits and everything... I've got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”He never apologized. He never showed remorse. He never admitted what he did was sexual assault.Eighteen years ago, while I was taking the number 9 home from Midtown to 121st and Amsterdam, a man ""grabbed my pussy"" on the subway. That is, while I was locked into the rush hour crowd, unable to move and with my arms around a large box I was carrying, a man reached under that box to stick his hand through my sundress into my vagina to fondle it. I tried to wiggle away, but I couldn't actually get away until the next stop, when I darted for the doors as soon as I could and then sat down to cry with the shame washing over me. I was “lucky”—though it's telling that I use that word—because I haven't been raped. But I have been violated, intimately touched without consent, that time and others.I never imagined that nearly two decades later, that subway experience would be the part of my history that dominates my thoughts on my birthday. But since my birthday is also inauguration day, I have a lot of company with other women, and men, trying to push away the memories of sexual assault that intrude upon them when they see the face or hear the voice of the president-elect, a man who is on the record, in his own words, describing how he sexually assaulted a woman. Too many who heard that story remembered his boast that he could do whatever he wanted, grab women “by the pussy,” but they missed the rest of his quote, in which he explicitly describes sexually assaulting a married woman:“I did try and fuck her. She was married… I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she's not got the big phony tits and everything... I've got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”He never apologized. He never showed remorse. He never admitted what he did was sexual assault.It will be a long four years for the country for too many reasons to count, but it will be even longer for millions of sexual assault survivors who must reckon with the fact that someone just like their attacker will now lead the country. His image will hang in the classrooms of our children, showing our boys and girls what consequences await those who violate another person's body, what (doesn't) happen when they tell someone.Shauna's assaults led her down a self-destructive and promiscuous path that took years of therapy to recover from. The president-elect is not a trigger for her today, but she has thought about and talked about her assaults more since his ascension, and she worries about how much progress he will reverse in the fight to end sexual violence.“I think he is normalizing sexism and rape culture, and we can't afford to let that become the norm,” she said. She hopes the strong online presence of survivors coming out and telling their stories will raise more awareness about the issue and show other survivors that recovery is possible. “Recovery from the mental and emotional damage that assault causes is painful, difficult and takes time,” she said.And the presence of a sexual assaulter on the news every day, making decisions that affect every American, can damage some of the progress survivors make.While the Access Hollywood tape is the only sexual assault admission captured on tape, other credible accusations were reported throughout the campaign—too many, from too many diverse sources, to dismiss. (See below.) And they're costly. The man who claims he will trim down the national budget has already done more than his share to add to the public health burden of sexual assault. And in fact, one of the items on the chopping block of his budget is funding for the Violence Against Women Act, which actually saves the U.S. an estimated net $16.4 billion a year.Rape is the costliest crime for both individuals and the nation, according to the Minnesota Department of Public Health and the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. The average cost of being a rape victim is $110,000, which adds up to $127 billion in the U.S. each year. That's because every year, 321,500 Americans age 12 and older are sexually assaulted or raped. According to MDPH, “Annually, victims pay about $44 billion of the $57 billion in expenses for traditional crimes of violence—murder, rape, robbery, assault and abuse and neglect. Employers pay out almost $5 billion (primarily in health insurance bills), and the government—and taxpayers—bear the remaining $8 billion through lost tax revenues and Medicare and Medicaid payments.”But it is the fault of half the electorate that a man who remorselessly boasted of sexual assault was today inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, sending the message that nothing stands in the way of a sexual predator when others do not fight back against rape culture. The subtext of his slogan might as well have been, ""Make America Rape Again.""“I worked in night clubs and bars after college and had my breasts, my ass, my hair, my face and my pussy grabbed by customers,” Rebecca said. “I learned to identify the men who were most likely to get out of hand, the men who think they have a right over a woman's body. At the time it just seemed like a workplace hazard but now that I am older, that I am a mother, I am angry. I am filled with rage thinking of men like Trump pawing at me, and it sickens me to think that other men will now laugh it off as presidential behavior.”Below is a list of credible sexual assault accusations against the President-elect. The Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Shauna's reminder to survivors is relevant: “This is not our shame to bear, it is our attackers.”Jessica Leeds said Trump fondled her breasts and tried to get his hand under her skirt during a flight. “He was like an octopus. His hands were everywhere,” she said.Temple Taggart McDowell said Trump kissed her on the lips on two different occasions without her consent, one time in his office.Rachel Crooks was an employee in Trump's building who met him on an elevator. He shook her hand, then would not let go as he drew her in and kissed her mouth and cheek. “I was so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do that,” she said.Kristin Anderson told the Washington Post that Trump moved his hand under her skirt and touched her vagina while sitting next to her.Natasha Stoynoff, a journalist for People Magazine, described an encounter with Trump at Mar-a-Lago: “We walked into that room alone, and Trump shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat. Now, I'm a tall, strapping girl who grew up wrestling two giant brothers. I even once sparred with Mike Tyson. It takes a lot to push me. But Trump is much bigger—a looming figure—and he was fast, taking me by surprise, and throwing me off balance. I was stunned. And I was grateful when Trump's longtime butler burst into the room a minute later, as I tried to unpin myself.”Mindy McGillivray described her experience at Mar-a-Lago: “All of a sudden I felt a grab, a little nudge. I think it's Ken's camera bag, that was my first instinct. I turn around and there's Donald. He sort of looked away quickly. I quickly turned back, facing Ray Charles, and I'm stunned.''Cassandra Searles, a contestant at one of his pageants, said, “He probably doesn't want me telling the story about that time he continually grabbed my ass and invited me to his hotel room.”In fact, Trump allegedly used his pageants as a way to view and touch the naked bodies of teenagers, minors: ""He just came strolling right in,"" Dixon said. ""There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Others girls were naked. Our first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half-naked changing into our bikinis.""Jill Harth filed a lawsuit in 1997 against Trump which alleged the following: “After Trump business associates left, the defendant [Trump] over the plaintiff's objections forcibly prevented plaintiff from leaving and forcibly removed plaintiff to a bedroom, whereupon defendant [Trump] subjected plaintiff to defendant's unwanted sexual advances, which included touching of plaintiff's private parts in an act constituting attempted “rape.” Trump forcefully removed [Harth] from public areas of Mar-A-Lago in Florida and forced [her] into a bedroom belonging to defendant's daughter Ivanka, wherein [Trump] forcibly kissed, fondled, and restrained [her] from leaving, against [her] will and despite her protests."""

dco7mlb,SurprisedSquee,"There are many, many things he has said he will do and won't do, so it's hard to untangle it. However, I'm more worried about his domestic policy, which seems to be his main focus anyway. * His proposals on healthcare are mysterious; his rejection of climate change and renewable energy is short-sighted and foolish; * his words on stopping wall street are promising, but his 5 Goldman Sachs nominees tell a different story; * the rest of his cabinet picks, except Mattis, either know nothing about the department they're heading, or actively want to dismantle it; * he wants to gut the FCC, which would be fine if I believed he would then give that power to the FTC, but I don't have much faith in that since he has never brought it up; * he himself has no experience working in politics other than buying politicians and knowing what loopholes in laws allow him to not pay his fair share of taxes;* I'm not so sure he isn't a Russian puppet, mostly because everything he has done in his foreign policy is something Russia would directly benefit from (splitting the UN, supporting Brexit, and the US lifting sanctions); * and his proposals on immigration, including requiring Muslims to register and wanting ""stop and frisk"" to be nation-wide, are bigoted and scary. There are plenty more examples, but I feel like I got my point across.The only thing I would agree with him on is his view on Glass-Steagall, but, as I said before, I'm not confident he will keep his promises there.Hillary, while *far* from perfect, did not worry me to anywhere near this degree."

dcoemw7,CaptainBayouBilly,The idea that capitalists want to create jobs is like saying someone wants to pay more bills. It's absurd.
dcof9vn,Baylow,I think we agree on principle but thats a weak argument. A capitalist loves to create jobs if those jobs generate a return for the capitalist. They do not want to create jobs out of the kindness of their hearts. If I can hire someone and get a % return on their labor then I want to create that job. That being said... That shouldn't be the mentality of an elected official who really shouldn't be interested in a return on labor but on full employment through finding ways (education and training) to make the workforce more productive and profitable.
dcogvqm,,"> A capitalist loves to create revenueFTFYIf that revenue creation requires jobs, then there will be more jobs. If not, then there will not be any more jobs.Do not pretend capitalists love to create jobs. Capitalists hate expenses and jobs are nothing but expenses for the company. They would eliminate all jobs if they could still maintain the same level of profit."
dcohf8n,notToNitPick,"Exactly.If you're running a business, you don't want to have to pay anyone else.And if you do have to pay them to do things, you'll pay as little as you can get away with."
dcokzw4,grassvoter,"That would r/malcompetitive businesses in the position of being able to stick it to the people. There actually are real businesses that value people ([B corporations](https://www.bcorporation.net)]), and business that pay decently on purpose."
dcohzmc,emmster,"Oh but he's gonna ""run the country like a business!"" Which I can't seem to get through to people is not a good thing. A government is not a business. And if it were, he's bankrupted enough businesses that I can't believe they're still saying that like it's a good thing."
dcojrt2,Baylow,"This is correct. The closest private analogy for the government is a non-profit organization. The primary stakeholders are those that the organization supports. Businesses are most responsible to those that have the largest economic stake in them. Given that, a government run like a business is a terrifying idea. It quite literally means that those with the most wealth are the most important."
dcofjhy,CaptainBayouBilly,It's a simple way to disprove the statement when a businessperson dangles the carrot of jobs in front of the unemployed.
dcogaao,Baylow,"What does that disprove? Business people generally don't ""dangle a carrot of jobs"" in front of the unemployed just for fun. Populist aspiring dictators do that, but business people generally tend to do what's best for their personal wealth. Donald Trump is a shitty businessman with a long history of failures, a pile of debt, and the legacy of a rich daddy... When I'm thinking of capitalist I'm thinking of people like Elon Musk, Larry and Sergey, etc that have created whole industries. Their incentive wasn't because they wanted to make the unemployed happy. They were trying to get rich. This isn't necessarily a bad thing if the education system is in place to make sure that people can be trained to take the jobs that innovators and capitalists create. This is where things fall apart in the US."
dcoh10l,CaptainBayouBilly,"That politicians and businesses want to ""create"" jobs. Politicians use this to get elected. Business people use it to get tax breaks. Businesses may need employees to function, but businesses/capitalists never ""want"" to create jobs. Question, if Musk or Page/Brinn could run Google without employees from the beginning, would they have chosen to do so? Capitalists do not innovate, they coalesce wealth. Capitalists extract profit from the exploitation of private, exclusive, ownership of capital"

dco8499,ttlens,He's neither.
dco92hv,rileymanrr,Forbes disagrees with you if you don't think he's a billionaire. Or at least that his net worth is more than a billion dollars. I guess it depends on you precise definition of billionaire.
dco9ico,ttlens,DJT feeds Forbes truckloads of BS and tried to convince them he is worth $10 billion. After discounting much of what he said they come up with around $4 billion but that is likely still highly inflated. He won't release his financial information or even his tax returns. The man is a blowhard and while I expect he's worth several hundred million I would be shocked to see it was actually over a billion today.
dco9wq3,rileymanrr,"So I'm no financial expert, but this is kinda Forbes' thing. I don't understand what motivation they would have for inflating his net worth. Even if he's worth 4 billion he's not even on the top 50 list. Why would Forbes care?"
dcoa9az,ttlens,Most of the billionaires on the Forbes list actively try to hide their full net worth and completely refuse to talk to Forbes at all when they are working on the list. These people would sooner not be on the list at all and it's likely there are a good number of people who do manage to keep themselves off the list by not having their assets directly tied to themselves.Trump on the other hand meets with Forbes and demands they inflate their numbers. The man craves attention but never provides anything real to back it up. This is just one more example of that.It it actually does come out that he is worth more than a billion dollars I would be genuinely surprised.
dcoaovq,rileymanrr,> Most of the billionaires on the Forbes list actively try to hide their full net worth and completely refuse to talk to Forbes at all when they are working on the list.So they generally make their list with no input whatsoever. Why would trump slinging a bunch of shit their way matter? Frankly I don't see Forbes playing favorites in general.
dcobots,tamman2000,"The point is that they aren't playing favorites, but if Donny makes his wealth look bigger and others make theirs look smaller, then they will, without bias, rank him higher than he rightfully should be ranked."
dcoa8mu,tomdarch,"Prior to the campaign/election, Trump wasn't important enough to fully research. How many man hours do you think went into generating lists like that?He clearly hides a ton of information about his finances, and clearly spreads false information about himself. He has clearly created an absurdly complex set of fronts and shells to obscure anyone ability to have an accurate view of his finances.(He also has good reason to hide his various debt from his various lenders so they continue lending to him and at better rates.)""He's nowhere near as wealthy as he claims"" is a very clear explanation for why he would go to these lengths. But until he releases his financial information (tax returns plus additional information) we simply don't know and we should be clear that we don't. He's an inveterate, shameless, constant liar, so the fact that he claims to be a billionaire should be met with total skepticism until he actually proves that he owns more than he owes."
dcoalcp,rileymanrr,So Forbes fucked up is what you are saying? I don't see their motivation for being dishonest. If I were them I'd only count the components of real estate that can be verified to be under Trump's ownership. It probably takes someone with actual skill in that task about an hour to get a good estimate of someone's material worth.

dcot331,LoneWolfe2,"Look the birther stuff was racist just like Jim Crow, segregation, and slavery. You can twist and turn yourself into proclaiming those weren't racist either because xyz but it doesn't change the factual reality.There was never any reason to question his citizenship other than racism."
dcoxx54,shemp33,"From where you're coming from, I can tell that we're simply not going to agree on this. Definition of racism is it is a prejudice against a person solely based on their race. Look at any form where they ask you to check the box for race: You see Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, etc... those are races. Canadian, Mexican, French, Japanese, American, Kenyan, Egyptian -- those are nationalities, not races. By your expanded stretch of ""racism"", not liking Canadians (even if for unfounded reasons), is racist. It's not. Some people just don't like Canadians. Going back to the birther thing, It was started by Sid Blumenthal and Hillary Clinton in 2008. Trump made an issue out of it later, but let's not be naieve and pretend that he *started* it. He didn't. In fact, Trump came out in a news conference and said ""Look, Barack Obama was born here, period, end of story."" So why are people still hanging that around his neck? Could it be.... reverse racism now?"
dcoydy5,LoneWolfe2,"No. He carried on that birther crap because Obama is black. If Obama were white and had a white name it would not have been an issue.I never claimed that he started it, don't put words in my mouth. Just that for 8yrs he was an annoying racist piece of shit about it.""Expanded definition"" is obfuscation. Hillary crap is deflection. Trump 8 yrs later is deflection. Reverse racism is straight from your ass. People are still hanging it around his neck because it's evidence of his racism and the fact that he kept at it long after Obama released his birth certificate is evidence is insane. You're right we'll never agree. You probably also think the Confederate flag isn't a symbol of racism."
dcoyv1h,shemp33,"OK, I hadn't really given a whole lot of thought to the confederate flag. I'm not from the south, I won't defend it as being a symbol of the south, or anything like that. I just know that no one gave two shits for many years about it until that idiot shot up a church, and suddenly it was an issue."
dcoz3bb,LoneWolfe2,It was an issue long before that (since it was first reintroduced) just like police brutality has been an issue for a long time before BLM. When you say no one cares what you mean is mainstream white America.
dcozh3f,shemp33,"I actually don't mean ""mainstream white America"". I'm going by CNN's story from here: http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/02/politics/confederate-flag-poll-racism-southern-pride/It was 33% racism, to 57% southern pride. I'm not sure where the other 10% went, but it seems to me that's not exactly ""just"" white Americans saying that. And that's only CNN's poll, from 2015. Do you support BLM? Because really, it should be ""All Lives Matter"" -- cops shouldn't be shooting people that aren't committing crimes. Your calling out of BLM indicates they feel like they're special. Really, the cops shouldn't be shooting at anyone."
dcoznps,LoneWolfe2,You said it wasn't an issue until the shooting. I'm saying it was one to many people long before that.You're reading BLM wrong in that case. It's BLM too not more. And it's perfectly fine because black people feel as if the criminal justice system from cops to courts to laws act as if Black lives don't matter. Therefore it is a proclamation that they do in fact matter.

dcouyu8,FenrisFrost,"I agree, the brainwashed masses of the Right are the real people to blame here. I'm just tired of that ""but her emails"" crap. No one who didn't vote for her, did so because of her e-mails. It's a big double standard and at the end of the day she was an unlikable candidate who offered/promised nothing to the American people. It isn't that people didn't like what Hillary was selling...it's that she wasn't selling anything, and Trump was. Still. Hillarites need to stop blaming everyone but the Dems for the L. They had a winning candidate and chose vanity."
dcowzci,yurigoul,"Ok, fair enough"
dcp100a,JudastheObscure,I don't think it's she that is the pig my friend.
dcomcua,tmaspoopdek,"That's a very misleading statement. Trump wasn't able to dodge scandals simply by being male, he did it by jumping from scandal to scandal so nothing lasted long enough to really damage him. Also, his base was encouraged to write off media coverage, polling data, and any non-Trump-connected source as biased."
dcond8r,yurigoul,"Actions speak louder than words - especially from a man who disrespects women as much as he does. And has followers who do the same.Besides, when people treat other people as shitty as they do, it is time to stop tolerating the intolerant."
dcoqfpn,tmaspoopdek,"That has nothing to do with what you said or what I said. I agree that Trump is a shitty human being and that he shouldn't be president. However, Hillary didn't lose simply because she was a woman. Nor did she get criticized simply because she was a woman. Assigning sexism to vast portions of the population is part of the reason why they were willing to vote in a man who is legitimately sexist."
dcorp2g,yurigoul,And again someone tries to blame the left for Trump - they are the new scapegoats. Do we still need Islamic terrorists?Same thing happens on Russian sponsored UK television.
dcoz2g6,tmaspoopdek,"Do you actually think that there was literally nothing the Democratic party or liberal-leaning people in general could've done better that might've made Trump's path to the white house harder? I support liberal policies, but given the results the Democratic party has been getting I think we need to look closely at how we approach politics and public discourses"
dcphm5o,yurigoul,I think they could have done way too much better. And I do hope one of the outcomes is a liberal party in the USA. If only the more respectable republicans would also start their own party or the Jesusland faction...

dcoo3xo,yurigoul,"Stop blaming it on other people, it makes you look like a trumpite in disguise, they do that too."
dcoryzn,EarthAllAlong,What other people am I blaming it on? I'm blaming it on democrats. Because it's their fault. It's also the fault of all the braindead republicans that voted for Trump who couldn't be bothered to take an interest in our country's future and instead voted because he made them laugh when he insulted people. I honestly am not even sure what you're trying to tell me here. Are you implying that trump's election is my fault? That I can't place blame on anyone else? I don't get what you want me to say.
dcoungl,yurigoul,"All kinds of people are blaming it on the left - especially people who like trump or have similar opinions. It is a tactic to take attention away from the real problem. Saying that and saying you are against political correctness etc. starts to become a sign someone is an extreme right wing fanatic - in Europe at least, and I am under the impression the same goes for America I believe. EDIT: democrats is not the left for me"
dcov9hk,EarthAllAlong,"Saying something like ""Rumors about a woman are believed by all, facts about a man are completely ignored by all"" implies that you think Hillary is blameless--that the rumors were just rumors. But not all of them were. Hell, not even most of them. She was a terrible candidate dragging behind her a list of controversies and scandals a mile long, and one of them was 100% true--the fact that she cheated in the primary. I said that if Hillary hadn't cheated, Sanders would have won the nomination, and the general election. It never would have been up to the nation to believe or disbelieve the rumors about her if she hadn't cheated (imo). Because it would have been Sanders vs Trump, and Sanders wins that easily...because he doesn't have a closet overflowing with skeletons, and he's also a new candidate who would galvanize voters, rather than an establishment candidate that people just assumed would win.I didn't mention political correctness."

They didn't do what a left winger would do - i.e. nationalise the provision of healthcare. It's exactly the same story with higher education. They don't really support unions a great deal. They support banks and other financial institutions almost as much as the Republicans. They tweak around the edges of America's overwhelmingly capitalist system, and outside of a handful of radicals they don't attempt to make any changes to it. They also prop up wars and conflict around the world. Basically they are a capitalist party. There's nothing wrong with that. But things that they propose that are attacked as 'too left wing' have been the standard in every developed country in the world. There's nothing ridiculously left wing about pointing that out. To give you an example regarding broad views on workers rights:* Extremely right wing: no workers' rights at all. No mandated holiday days. No union protection. No restrictions on firing staff (Republicans)* Centre/centre right: Some workers' rights. Some mandated paid holiday (e.g. 15-20 days), some union protection, some restrictions on firing staff. Mandated paid maternity leave (Democrats. See also the UK for instance)* Centre left: Lots of workers rights. Mandated paid holiday (25-35 days), strong protections for unions, very difficult to fire staff for anything other than criminality, long mandated maternity and paternity leave. (No party in the US - see centre left capitalist countries like France or Sweden for examples)* Extreme left: The workers own the means of production. Rights as such are unnecessary as they are also the owners. If you see the democrats as particularly left wing, it's more that your view is warped grossly to the right. The Overton window is ridiculously right wing in the US - somewhere where many people still argue that it should be okay to fire your staff for any reason at any time or that if you can't afford healthcare you don't deserve it."

dconn0s,Torontolego,Wait. Insurance company cancels policy? How can that happen?
dcoru1e,PiperArrow,"Your policy typically runs for a calendar year. Your serious illness runs longer. Before the ACA, there was no obligation to renew any policy. Get sick? No more insurance after the end of the year. So lots of American only have/had insurance right up until the moment they need it, or maybe a few months longer.That's an oversimplification of course. If you work for a very large employer, you're probably a bit better off, because one or a few employees coming down with something really serious won't change the premiums for the company much. But if you work, say, for a small machine shop / store / whatever with 10 employees, what happens if you get sick? The owner has two choices: (a) Fire you to keep his insurance rates almost reasonable, or (b) stand by you and go bankrupt, so that everyone at the business loses their insurance. Either way, you're going to lose your insurance, and with it perhaps your life."

dcom7jo,Cooking_Drama,"Do you think non-emergency doctors are forced to treat you if they know they're not going to be paid? Welcome to America lol. There's a reason why people say that healthcare shouldn't be tied to profits.If you go to an oral surgeon to get a tooth pulled and they recommend that you get an implant to prevent bone loss (which is inevitable when you lose a tooth), they're not going to give you an implant (which costs between $2k-$8k normally) unless they know you can pay them for it. Dental implants aren't even elective surgeries (like breast implants or something like that). Your dental *and* medical insurance covers various parts of the implant and the surgery you need to get it in your mouth. But if you don't have insurance, your chances of getting a doctor to do one for you are pretty low. Same with wisdom teeth. No dentist or oral surgeon is going to go anywhere near them without you having some sort of insurance no matter how much you're suffering. I know that one from experience."

dcovf8g,Cooking_Drama,It's only considered cosmetic if you lost the tooth before you had the insurance you're currently on -unless- it's a congenital defect and you were born without the tooth. All part of the pre-existing condition clause that people hated about our old medical insurance.But yeah that really sucks. America's dental care is fucking awful. I have my dental plan through United Healthcare and they barely cover anything except free cleanings every 6 months. Fucking bogus.
dcovvbq,my_little_mutation,"Hm, maybe it was some other clause why insurance wouldn't cover it, they've been on the same plan for ages now. I'm on gateway currently and haven't even tried going in, but I'm cleared to switch to insurance through my work and I'm praying the dental is good. I need so much work done. X.x"
dcp08pd,Cooking_Drama,"Hmmm it's possible that they just had really shitty, bottom of the barrel dental insurance, but implants are usually covered under the class 3 or 4 reimbursement level.Anyway I hope you get good dental too!"
dcolf1r,PacmanZ3ro,"I mean, even with ACA most people on the lowest end of the spectrum that ""couldn't afford it before ACA"" still can't afford anything even remotely serious. ACA or not, they can't afford the deductibles or out of pocket expenses. Sure it's better than if they had nothing, but being bankrupt by 1k or bankrupt by 5k is hardly a difference at all. Also, in many cases where people legitimately cannot afford the procedures the hospitals are typically willing to lower expenses and set up payment plans that people can at least pay for. Alternately you can simply walk away from it and declare bankruptcy if you don't mind your credit getting raped. ACA fixed absolutely nothing other than allowing people to go to the doctor for preventative care, which is good and was badly needed, but does not solve or even come close to addressing the fact that if you couldn't afford health care before, you still can't afford it now if anything actually happens."
dcomgob,Verick808,That is ridiculous. Obviously 1k can be paid off more easily than 5k and it should go without saying that a loan fo 1k should be easier to get and ultimately you'd be paying alot less in interest if you jave a hard time paying it off. It is a lot easier to pull yourself out of a shallow hole than a deep one.
dcongnm,PacmanZ3ro,"If you're so broke and in debt from medical bills that you are bankrupt (IE the total debt of your medical expenses is greater than your net worth), it does not matter if you're 1k below 0 or 5k below 0, you will not be able to get a loan (unless you go into getting loans from shady sources). In those cases you declare bankruptcy, take a 5-year hit to your credit so you have your debt absolved and don't lose everything you own in the process. Also, most hospitals and offices are willing to work with people to take an amount lower than billed on a payment plan they can afford. If not, go through above process. I wasn't talking about 1k in debt vs 5k in debt, obviously that's a major difference. I was talking about a bankrupt status where your debt is greater than your net worth. In that case, 1k vs 5k is much less meaningful from any practical standpoint."

You say people should be responsible and look after their health, but you think they shouldn't be allowed to afford a doctor? How does that make any sense?Also, life happens. People get cancer. Car accidents. Hereditary issues. Etc. There are so many reasons why someone may fall on poor health despite doing their best to take care of themselves, I don't think I need to sit and type them all out to you. Do you think that people in these unfortunate circumstances deserve to be financially ruined just so that we can spite some other person who has been irresponsible with their money/health?As a matter of fact, how healthy are you? How much money do you have? Do you make sure to get all the nutrients you need every day? Do you eat any fast food? I hope not. Do you get enough cardio? Do you lift enough? Have you made sure to avoid lead and asbestos and radiation? Now take these last several sentences and please apply them to everyone in your life who you care about enough to want them to not die, be seriously sick, or be bankrupt. Go ahead and call them, text them, go to see them everyday and ask them those questions so that you can be sure they are being responsible. If not, they do deserve some serious hardships, don't they?Also make sure you don't get caught in any natural disasters, get hit by a car accident, get hurt by a random crazy shooter, get cancer, have a stroke, or get laid off! That would be very irresponsible of you."

And I'm not sure why you think I want it to be free rather than being affordable. You said you can't wait for some random person to attempt to go to the doctor and be turned away because they can't afford it. You didn't say something like, ""I can't wait for my premiums to go down"" or ""I can't wait for costs in general to go down"". It was specifically about someone else facing a difficulty. That's pretty morbid and it stinks a little bit of a general contempt for the rest of your fellow citizens.The costs right now are absurd. Saying people should have care isn't the same as saying it should be free. You took quite a leap there.

Seriously, I get that book/comic source material is a treasured memory for many people, and those people may be disappointed when things don't play out ""the way they should"" on the big screen. But writers and directors like to put they're own spin on things to make the film their own. Without artistic freedom, a director wouldn't be creating anything new, they'd simply be recreating the works of someone else line by line, shot by shot."
dcowrzn,AskMeForFunnyVoices,"Absolutely. Of course, there are some adaptations that are crummy and poorly executed but that's just to be expected. Sometimes things change for the worse because they aren't in the spirit of the original. But many more are not like this. Take Lord of the Rings. Movies are a great adaptation that streamlines the book into something more easily digested by movie audiences. Lots of detail in the world, without being excessively long-winded. Most of the changes (amalgamating several characters together, adding a few, taking out subplots) were still done in the spirit of the original world.I'm as big a fan boy of most universes as the next, but I'm also willing to give any adaptation a chance to say what it wants to say"

dcooc6p,Cooking_Drama,"> ""You don't belong in politics because you're not a politician.""I don't think that's what this comic is saying at all. Pilots aren't born pilots and politicians aren't born politicians. Pilots go through years upon years of training in order to be Pilots. Anyone can be a Pilot if they want to be, but you can't just wake up one day and say ""You know what? I'm going to apply to Delta Airlines' open Pilot positions today!"" I mean, you can, but Delta would deny you for not having any piloting experience.Politicians should be the same way and America should be like Delta from my example- don't allow someone to run your government without prior experience. Barack Obama was just a kid born to a single mother in Hawaii. He went to school for political science then became a Senator. Whether people liked him or not, he was qualified for the job of President. Trump is exactly like the passenger in this example. He skipped all the important steps that one would normally take to become a political leader and got people riled up enough to vote for him. And just like the implied outcome of the comic, it probably will not go very well for him or for us."

dco9mr1,bitter_cynical_angry,"Fair enough, but at best that just means that *both* sides are being anti-intellectual about it, not that the left wing isn't."
dcoadkn,MajorToewser,"Which statistics out there are explicitly pro-gun?Keep in mind, these statistics need to support a compelling pro-gun case (even in the face of contradictory evidence and statistics), not just show that guns aren't always bad...Also, the pro-gun camp appeals to emotions too... In fact it largely hinges on one key emotion: fear."
dcoc3nn,bitter_cynical_angry,">Keep in mind, these statistics need to support a compelling pro-gun case (even in the face of contradictory evidence and statistics), not just show that guns aren't always bad...Absolutely not! Given the default position of the 2nd Amendment and the individual right to bear arms as recently upheld by the Supreme Court, the burden of proof is on people to show that guns are bad and should be regulated more than they currently are, not that they are good.Therefore, anti-gun advocates need to present evidence, and pro-gun advocates can attack that evidence.That said, in addition to the idea that political power comes out of the barrel of a gun and therefore people should be armed if they are to be the ultimate source of power for a government, a common secondary use for guns is for personal self-defense against crime. You may find the [Wikipedia article on defensive gun use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_gun_use) interesting. Even the lowest estimates of defensive gun use frequency are almost triple the number of people killed by guns, including suicides (and incidentally, including suicides in the number is one of the intellectually dishonest ways many anti-gun advocates abuse statistics)."
dcod5rr,MajorToewser,"So... I'll take that nonresponse as that you don't have any statistics. If you would actually take the time to read your own (wikipedia) link, there are multiple studies cited in that article that are actually contradictory to your ""statements.""**You** are the one that made the statement that the anti-gun position is anti-intellectual because it is based on misleading statistics, not me. I just want you to support your own position with evidence, which you have spectacularly failed to do.You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of argument in general, and also specifically the gun regulation argument. The evidence that the current state of gun ownership in this country doesn't work **has** been provided; it's shown by the fact that the homicide rate is seven times higher in the U.S. than the combined homicide rate of 22 other high-income countries, even when the overall crime rates are similar. This is a direct result of the fact that the _firearm_ homicide rate in the U.S. is twenty times greater than in these other high-income countries. These are a direct result of gun ownership and gun ownership laws in the United States... I'm just waiting for you to ""attack"" that evidence with something more than (completely empty) rhetoric, anecdotes, or singular statistics.As an aside, I also find it completely laughable that you think your gun cabinet provides any real check on governmental power in 2017."

You cannot directly compare the crime rates of different countries. The US is more racially and culturally diverse than many other first-world countries. It's also more diverse economically, and most firearm homicides (note, homicides, not suicides) are among the poorest people. The US also has a much worse drug problem than most other first-world countries, and a history of both racial discrimination and of a high level of permissiveness and personal freedom. Further, a large majority of homicides are committed with handguns, and yet gun control bills tend to concentrate on semi-automatic rifles.>As an aside, I also find it completely laughable that you think your gun cabinet provides any real check on governmental power in 2017.This is a common trope and I'm happy to debate it, if you are willing to listen to opposing points of view."

But one easy example, you say:> a common secondary use for guns is for personal self-defense against crimeAnd go on to extol its effectiveness.From the wikipedia article:> A 2015 study by Solnick and Hemenway which analyzed NCVS data reported ""little evidence that [DGU] is uniquely beneficial in reducing the likelihood of injury or property loss.--> A 2009 study reported that gun owners were more likely to be shot in an assault than were non-gun owners, and concluded that the chances of DGU being successful for residents of urban areas may be low.--> Another study published the same year found that DGU is an effective deterrent against injury for some groups of people, but not others; notable groups for whom DGU did not provide benefits in this study included women, people living in rural areas, and those living in low-income homes.Or your ""statements"" about DGU frequency...> A 2004 study surveyed the records of a Phoenix, Arizona newspaper, as well as police and court records, and found a total of 3 instances of defensive gun use over a 3.5 month period.

Because there are more.Also, I'm not making a comment on these studies or conclusions.

I'm all ears. Because it's easy to shout ""misleading statistic"" (or ""fake news"") without then providing any actual evidence to support that claim. I'm still the only one that has actually provided a statistic.As another aside, yes I'm aware of the prevalence of handgun ownership and violence. Are you saying you'd support further handgun regulation instead of further rifle regulation? Because I certainly would.---Your use of the word ""trope"" is somewhat amusing.

dcol2f8,bitter_cynical_angry,">A 2015 study by Solnick and Hemenway which analyzed NCVS data reported ""little evidence that [DGU] is uniquely beneficial in reducing the likelihood of injury or property loss.Doesn't matter if it's *uniquely* beneficial, it only has to be beneficial.>A 2009 study reported that gun owners were more likely to be shot in an assault than were non-gun owners, and concluded that the chances of DGU being successful for residents of urban areas may be low.OK, but the sentence right after that is this:>A 2013 National Research Council report found that studies looking at the effectiveness of different self-protective strategies had consistently found that victims who used guns defensively had lower injury rates than did victims who used other strategies.Then for this one:>Another study published the same year found that DGU is an effective deterrent against injury for some groups of people, but not others; notable groups for whom DGU did not provide benefits in this study included women, people living in rural areas, and those living in low-income homes.For reference, [here's the abstract of that study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280778062_An_examination_of_the_impact_of_victim_offender_and_situational_attributes_on_the_deterrent_effect_of_defensive_gun_use_A_research_note). It says that for 1992 to 1999, the study showed that DGU didn't reduce the rate of injury for those groups, but it didn't say the risk of injury was increased, so it's not a good argument for gun control; at best it's neutral.>A 2004 study surveyed the records of a Phoenix, Arizona newspaper, as well as police and court records, and found a total of 3 instances of defensive gun use over a 3.5 month period. In contrast, Kleck and Gertz's study would predict that the police should have noticed more than 98 DGU killings or woundings and 236 DGU firings at adversaries during this time.[Here's the full text of that study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1730063/pdf/v010p00096.pdf), and here's a relevant quote from it:>Our findings were closer to the National Crime Victimization Survey, which predicts we should have found eight DGU killings or woundings and 19 DGU firings at adversaries.The National Crime Victimization Survey was actually what I was referring to when I said DGU frequency was about triple that of all gun deaths, not the Kleck/Gertz study which suggests DGU frequency is more like 70 times higher than that of all gun deaths.>A 1995 study led by Arthur Kellermann, which examined 198 home invasion crimes in Atlanta, Georgia, found that in only 3 of these cases did victims use guns for self-protection.

Note that it is not a study of invasions of homes of gun owners, but of any homes, so we don't know what percentage of homes had guns that could potentially have been used, but weren't used or weren't effective.>I'm going to mostly ignore your statement about comparing countries crime rates, because you immediately go on to compare countries in a variety of other categories and clearly overlook the complexities of those categories (and any effects that they may have on crime rate).So those complexities and their effects on crime rate are relevant when I talk about them, but not when you do? One significant problem for both sides in comparing national statistics between countries is the availability and detail level of the statistics themselves. I acknowledge that the US has a higher gun homicide rate, but I don't think there's any statistics available that explicitly show why. That's a problem for the gun control advocates as well, because what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. A high gun homicide rate is not enough, on its own, with no other information, to make the case for more gun control.>As another aside, yes I'm aware of the prevalence of handgun ownership and violence. Are you saying you'd support further handgun regulation instead of further rifle regulation? Because I certainly would.I would be more willing to at least consider arguments for handgun regulation, though I think that would be the wrong approach on the face of it. Much better would be to solve the underlying problems of poverty, and drug black markets.>Your use of the word ""trope"" is somewhat amusing. Do you want to actually present some evidence or even an actual argument (I'm seeing a theme developing here) to how your personal arsenal is going to provide a check to a modern, developed state? Because I'm getting visions of Waco.Again, the burden of proof here is on you to show why people shouldn't have guns, because the default position is that people have the right to keep and bear arms. However, Waco is an interesting example, and Ruby Ridge even more so. The lessons the government took from those, I would say, led to the much better handling of the recent standoff in Oregon. You might also look into the history of the Black Panthers, specifically [the events that led up to the passing of the Mulford Act in California](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-panthers-california-1967_us_568accfce4b014efe0db2f40). I love that there seems to be a recent trend of left-leaning people arming themselves and taking responsibility for their own defense against what they see as a possibly oppressive government; history repeats itself."
dcom24k,MajorToewser,"Buddy. I'm glad you decided to pick apart the studies with loose statements, but, like I said, I wasn't providing commentary on the quality of these studies. I was only showing you that contradictions abound in the wikipedia article because you asked... (Thanks for scrolling down and picking out each of the citations though, guess that's a step in the right direction.)Also, I'm not actually dismissing anything, because you haven't actually presented anything. I'm not arguing that there is complexity, you are. I'm just saying that if there is complexity (like you are arguing), it's complex and you are just handwaving around that complexity without any evidence... I, on the other hand, think it's pretty straightforward, more guns equals more gun violence.I'm making the assertion that higher firearm homicide rates are a result of more firearms and looser regulations, which there is at least some evidence of. You're just making a counter point without any actual evidence at all.Obviously there are many complex causes of crime, but, like other developed countries, crime will happen (crime rates are similar) but with fewer guns there will be fewer gun crimes... Also, since poverty is intrinsic in conservative policy, that cause of crime is not going to be addressed anyway.Finally, wow, you love to just shove the burden of proof on other people. I guess that's a learned reflex from not actually having any proof? This final ""argument"" isn't even about whether people should or shouldn't ""have guns""! So that line doesn't even work in this context. I want to know how your personal gun collection will protect you from a modern, developed state. Just pointing to a bunch of ""incidents"" and calling them interesting isn't actually an argument, by the way."
dcon3cc,bitter_cynical_angry,"You brought up those examples to try to show why my statement that guns are commonly used defensively isn't true. I attacked those examples and showed why they don't actually invalidate my statement.>I'm making the assertion that higher firearm homicide rates are a result of more firearms and looser regulations, which there is evidence of.And I assert that it's a function of greater disparity between race, culture, and income, which there is also evidence of (that is, like your points, evidence that there are such differences, not necessarily evidence that such differences themselves account for the higher gun homicide rate).>with fewer guns there will be fewer gun crimes...This is another really common talking point. I don't think we should care about what weapon a crime is committed with. A person is no less dead if they were killed by a knife or beaten to death than if they were shot. So reducing the amount of ""gun crimes"" is completely unimportant. The important thing is reducing crimes, and what you need to show is that by removing guns or by regulating them in some additional way, the incidence of crime itself will be reduced.>Finally, wow, you love to just shove the burden of proof on other people. I guess that's a learned reflex from not actually having any proof?Yep, keep telling yourself that, it makes these debates so much more civil.>I want to know how your personal gun collection will protect you from a modern, developed state. Just pointing to a bunch of ""incidents"" and calling them interesting isn't actually an argument, by the way.My own personal arsenal will probably never have to protect me personally from a modern, developed state, so that's a bit of a red herring. What I gave are examples of how other peoples' personal arsenals protected them in some way from a modern, developed state. Any one single individual can obviously be squashed like a bug by a modern, developed state, and there may be not a damn thing they can do about it. That's as true now as it was in the 1700s. The strength of an armed population lies in collective action, and that is what my examples show."
dcop0j8,MajorToewser,"> You brought up those examples to try to show why my statement that guns are commonly used defensively isn't true. I mean, no I didn't. I brought them up to show that they existed in the article that you linked... Which is what I said... Their conclusions **are** contradictory to your statement about DGU, regardless of the quality of the conclusions...I was just pointing out that linking to the DGU wikipedia article wasn't a great way to support your position (and certainly didn't qualify as supportive statistics, which is what I was asking for)...> And I assert that it's a function of greater disparity between race, culture, and incomeYes, but you haven't actually provided any of that evidence. You haven't even given evidence whether those things are statistically different, let alone if they actually have an impact on homicide and firearm homicide rates. (And, let's not even start to talk about how you'd address them... I guess maybe you wouldn't?)> The important thing is reducing crimes, and what you need to show is that by removing guns or by regulating them in some additional way, the incidence of crime itself will be reduced.I mean... let's go through some logical reasoning... 1) Crime will always exist and its causes, like poverty, race, and culture, are incredibly hard/impossible to address, and, in the case of poverty, generational, and often systemic.2) [Guns are more deadly than knives or fists.](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2008-2012.xls)3) So, the best way to prevent homicide (the crime of killing someone) is to prevent gun crime...I'm not trying to prevent all crime, just gun crime, so why would I need to prove that removing guns reduces overall crime? People die less in gunless crime, which is what I care about...> The strength of an armed population lies in collective action, and that is what my examples show.Those examples don't actually show any of that. How did their personal arsenals protect them at all? It certainly didn't in Waco or Ruby Ridge, Bundy was arrested and is facing 16 felonies, and armed ""copwatching"" led to the loss of public carry in the state of California and arguably was/is less effective than unarmed ""copwatching""... So, I'm failing to see how any of these examples show a personal arsenal protecting anyone, or anyone's rights.> That's as true now as it was in the 1700s. Yes, but, in the 1700s, the power disparity between a nation state and its citizens was exponentially less... And today that disparity is to the point of insurmountability, even by large scale collective action."
dcor2sk,bitter_cynical_angry,">Their conclusions are contradictory to your statement about DGU, regardless of the quality of the conclusions...This doesn't follow. If their conclusions aren't true, or are unsupported, or don't show what they say they show, then they aren't contradictory to my statement about DGU. Further, all I said was that DGU uses are ""common"", by the lowest estimates, about three times more common than gun deaths (and about 6 times more common than gun homicides). None of the examples you gave contradict that.>Yes, but you haven't actually provided any of that evidence. You haven't even given evidence whether those things are statistically different, let alone if they actually have an impact on homicide and firearm rates.OK, tell me which 22 countries' homicide rates you're combining, and we can pick some of them and see how their demographics match up to the US.>(And, let's not even start to talk about how you'd address them... I guess maybe you wouldn't?)I would like to see single-payer healthcare, legalize or decriminalize all drugs, increased funding for public education including free or greatly subsidized higher education, increased taxes on higher incomes, better enforcement of corporate tax laws, job training programs and neighborhood revitalization programs for inner cities, better sex ed including distribution of free birth control, better access to abortion services... I could probably name a few more. After all that is done and if crime is still high, then I'd be more willing to consider calls for more gun control.>I mean... let's go through some logical reasoning... I disagree with your premises for number 1, and I don't think number 3 is a good trade-off.>I'm not trying to prevent all crime, just gun crime...Then we're probably at an impasse here.>How did their personal arsenals protect them at all?It kept them from being immediately arrested on the spot. Bundy was eventually arrested, yes, as were all the people with him, and one was killed. But they got their message out and got much more national exposure than if they had simply been dragged out the same day they'd walked in, which is what would have happened if they hadn't been armed. You probably don't agree with their message, I don't either, and that's OK, what's relevant is that it was heard, even if the country ended up not doing much about it. Armed resistance is the last resort, but it's a resort.>And today that disparity is to the point of insurmountability, even by large scale collective action.That's your opinion. It's never really been tried in the US in the form of a mass civil uprising, and hopefully it never will be. However, there are many historical examples of lightly armed populaces causing a great deal of trouble for modern armies. And not everyone in the military is going to be willing to clamp down on their own countrymen."

dcoa5av,jedi_lion-o,"Yes, you should vote for someone who represents your interests. However, there is enough access to information that many people are aware that what is best for them may be negatively impacting others. So if you are casting a vote in a way that helps yourself, but hurts others, one might conclude that you are either ignorant or heartless. Ignorance can be forgiven, but is still looked down upon (especially when it is willful ignorance). But if you are well education (as is likely the case of the rich and successful), then you must be putting your own interests above all else. For those of us who include the interests of all Americans (including the little guy who needs a hand!) within our own interest, this type of behavior is selfish, disgusting, and has no room in the vision of a community that works together to solve our problems."

This is the difference. Voting for your interests shouldn't mean voting against everyone else's, but that's exactly what a rich person's vote for Trump would mean.

Khmer Rouge soldiers referred to Phnom Penh as ""the great prostitute of the Mekong."" (Chandler, The Tragedy of Cambodian History, 247). Ordinary citizens were moved out of the cities to live and work in the countryside as peasants in order to create the ideal communist society. The goal of converting everyone to peasants was due to the fact that this class of people was believed to be “simple, uneducated, hard-working and not prone to exploiting others.” They had lived that way for years and always managed to get by. For this reason, the Khmer Rouge called the peasants ""old people"" and considered them as the ideal communists for the new Cambodian state.> Those who lived in the cities were seen as ""new people"" and were considered “the root of all capitalist evil” by the Khmer Rouge. New people were the quintessence of capitalism and therefore the opponent of communism. No matter what their profession was - teacher, tailor, civil servant or monk - it was irrelevant. According to the Khmer Rouge, the new people had made the decision to live in the cities, proving their loyalty to capitalism. Because of this, hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were automatically branded enemies of the new communist state and were killed.Pol Pot was inspired by Mao Zedong's [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution).> Set into motion by Mao Zedong, then Chairman of the Communist Party of China, its stated goal was to preserve 'true' Communist ideology in the country by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society"

dco8nc8,Josh6889,"> tired of smart people telling them what to do That makes Trump bragging about his cabinets IQ a bit odd. Of course, I was unaware of there being a database that includes the IQ of members of a presidential cabinet."
dcodjsc,fourpac,"The real problem is that Trump doesn't have any idea what their IQ scores are. He just says these things without any facts to back it up and people just report it and share it. He uses hyperbole in every sentence. He speaks in car salesman language. Everything he's selling is the ""best"" ""greatest"" and ""legendary."" Everything that opposes him is ""sad"" ""failing"" and ""losers."""
dcoa4nf,ElectricFirex,IQ can be (mistakenly) presented as some sort of natural smart rather than someone who has been educated.
dcodqac,Tipop,"The *intent* of IQ is to show how quickly one can learn, so by measuring how much you've learned at a certain age (still in school), they can show how much you've managed to absorb in X years.(Note that I'm not defending it, just explaining the intent.)"
dcoefe5,getzdegreez,What? No. It's intended to be acurate regardless of education.
dcoi5bs,unhampered_by_pants,"And yet, formal education level correlates more with IQ score than anything innate (socioeconomic level, too, but one could say that socioeconomic level and formal education level often go hand in hand)."
dcojvt0,getzdegreez,Your parenthetical reasoning is the likely answer. Not independent variables.
dcoex5y,Tyr_Tyr,"It's those eggheads he & they distain. The ones that get PhDs, and claim they know better because ""they studied this subject"" instead of having ""very good brains."""

dco8nms,Dicethrower,"Science is starting to uncover inconvenient truths. Like, ""we can't keep going on like this"" or just the general mortality aspect of ""things change in general"", which some people just don't want to listen to. In that case it's the best course of action to just attack science as a(n ass) whole."
dco91om,Bayho,"I can tell, I am already being downvoted for stating a fact of our history. Look at scientists during World War II, rocket scientists taking us to the Moon. Yet, I am being downvoted?"

dcod022,morpheousmarty,"He's not saying they are sub human demons, he's saying they're sick of smart people telling them what to do and it's objectively true. The massively popular post when he won said so. From vaccinations to climate change, his policy flies in the face of science."
dcokzkh,TheTrashMan,"I think you should reread his post, he is making a sweeping generalization of all trump supporters. You may feel one way about it but saying all people think the same way isn't productive discourse."
dcodgkm,Tipop,"Referring to people who *literally* — and I use that in the correct sense — show disdain for education as anti-intellectuals is not demonizing them, it's simply an accurate description.Also, demonizing a group of people is not the same as anti-intellectualism either."
dco8sz0,Honoluuluu,Lol I like how anything that doesn't fall into the liberal narrative is deemed anti-intellectual
dcob0v0,ArztMerkwurdigliebe,"I'm sorry, so how exactly is detesting and routing out educated, experienced individuals with highly specialized knowledge in their fields not intellectual? Kind of wondering how being mocked for going to college isn't anti-intellectual. How is the GOP platform literally saying that schools shouldn't teach critical thinking skills because it might upset parents not anti-intellectualism? Maybe when right wing policies and beliefs stop flying in the face of intellectualism and educated, measured opinions and responses, then they will stop being labelled as anti-intellectual."
dcogorp,velumer,Ben Carson
dco9q5n,uptotwentycharacters,"It's not deemed anti-intellectual because it doesn't fit into some spooky scary ""liberal narrative"", rather the so-called ""liberal narrative"" is driven by intellectualism.

dcorsp0,MichaelGFox,When did i ever express my views/who i support. You're jumping to conclusions
dcoduwf,Cant_Tell_Me_Nothin,"Where you are wrong is where you think people in general are driven by intellectualism. It makes you feel better than others to think of yourself as someone who has higher mental capacity than all the other peasants. What people should learn from this election is that humans are mostly governed by their emotional/subconscious/irrational/limbic side. Obama won because he appealed to people's emotion of hope and change and diversity. Hillary also tried to appeal to people's emotions of diversity and breaking the glass ceiling (""I'm with Her""), but her message was not as persuasive enough as Trump's patriotic one. When faced with the fact that Trump had a chance, she mostly left her message behind, and started appealing to people's fear emotion about Trump. But it was not enough. No one really remembers what Hillary's policies really were except some political platitudes. No one really remembers the specifics of Obama's promises when he was campaigning back in 2008. They only remember what they felt about Obama. And that is how they voted. That is how everyone votes, and will always vote. You were not gonna vote for Bernie or Hillary because you unemotionally and intellectually weighed each of their policies. You mostly went by what their message made you feel."

dconlr9,marknutter,"When they do it using evidence from the soft sciences, then yes."
dco9n2m,LateSoEarly,Where in OP's comment do you see anything that's part of the liberal narrative?
dcoa312,,"The part where it says he boasted about sexual assault. He didn't. He said, in vulgar terms, that because he was rich and famous women let him do whatever he wants to them."
dcoa82t,Pjmax,"Well the exact quote is ""They let you do it!"", so yeah I'd definitely take that as boasting. Not sure how you could even say it's not."
dcoagga,,"Boasting, sure, but not boasting about sexual assault. The bit about ""they let you do it"" kinda precludes any possibility of assault, and the context does not lend itself towards implying coercion."
dcogqsz,jeopardy987987,"""Let"" does not mean consent. People ""let"" robbers take their wallets when the robber has a means of coercion (weapon).Trump ALSO bragged that he would just grab them without asking. In other words, there was no opportunity for consent prior to his actions. And afterwards, many, many have objected, both publicly and even in court proceedings. So yes, it is sexual assault."
dcohtpx,,What weapon was Trump pointing at them? His dick?
dcotzc0,jeopardy987987,"his money and power and fame, and in some cases, their continued employment."
dcprei9,,"You're just making shit up at this point, it's like a fantasy you so badly want to believe that you're conjuring shit out of thin air. There's not a single thing to suggest Trump was threatening any woman with his power and fame, or their continued employment. None. And before you point out to me all those women that accused him of rape (that appeared conveniently immediately after he made a fool of Hillary in the 2nd debate with the ""Because you'd be in jail."" line) I'll remind you that not a single one of those cases got anywhere because there was not a shred of evidence. It was a pure smear campaign."
dcps8ym,jeopardy987987,">There's not a single thing to suggest Trump was threatening any woman with his power and fameHe said it himself that he did it without asking and that they let him do it because of power and fame. Many of them were either employees or contestants. And more than a dozen have said that it was not consensual. grabbing women sexually without their consent is sexual assault. 1) He stated that he did it without asking. There was no opportunity for consent prior to his acts. 2) many have objected to his after the fact, even despite him being in a position of power over them. It's sexual assault."
dcq2dk7,,"> There was no opportunity for consent prior to his actsYou don't know the context. They could have been flirting for hours beforehand. Again, you're conjuring details that don't exist and can't be confirmed. While it's possible that it *was* sexual assault, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that's the case and the idea of ""innocent until proven guilty"" is a good one.>many have objected to his after the factIn absurd ways, with stories that don't match the details of real life and say they met Trump at places he was not. Do you honestly not think there was something odd about the timing of that whole thing? As soon as Trump gains points with that ""because you'd be in jail"" comment suddenly tons of women come out of the woodwork to accuse him of rape, some of which had prior connections with Hillary or the DNC, and then NONE of their cases are remotely solid?I mean if that's all it takes to convince you someone's a rapist, then what's to stop someone from hiring 15 women to say Obama raped them in the past 10-20 years? Even if all their cases don't go anywhere, would you still think Obama raped them?"
dcs0vz9,jeopardy987987,"OMG, he said it himself. I don't know the context about whether there was an opportunity to consent? HE SAID IT HIMSELF. ok, looks like the red pill has been leaking out into other subs. We are done here. have a nice day."
dcsx8wa,,"Getting a little too hard to maintain your delusion, eh?"
dcoannf,LateSoEarly,"Are we seriously gonna have to bring up the fact that ""consent"" or ""letting you do it"" when under the force of a powerful person is not really consent at all? You put a gun to my head and ask if I'll suck a homeless dude's cock, am I *really* consenting at that point? One of the richest men in America confronts you in private and tries to grope you, do you really feel like you're free to say no, much less call the cops?"
dcohsxr,,"What world are you living in where a man can corner a woman in public and do what he pleases while bystanders look on nonchalantly? You're completely making up this ""force"" part, nothing implies that at all. Nobody was pointing a gun at anybody."
dcojw94,LateSoEarly,"I don't know why you're choosing to read certain words in my comments but not others. I didn't say anyone had a gun wtf? It was an example of how force nullifies any consent someone gives. Being in a powerful position can be a form of force. If a rich man who runs the TV show you're on confronts you and tries to grab your genitals, you'd have a harder time resisting that than you would if an everyday citizen did. Clear?"
dcpr9qc,,"But there's no evidence of him using force, none at all. That part is completely fabricated by people who want to believe that it was sexual assault. What he said was vulgar and crass, no question, but it was not at all describing sexual assault. There is absolutely NOTHING to suggest he used force or coercion on that woman."
dcptaz4,LateSoEarly,"Are you daft? BEING RICH AND FAMOUS MEANS YOU HAVE POWER, PEOPLE FEEL FORCED TO DO WHAT YOU SAY. Jesus fuck dude this is not hard to understand. Your critical reading skills are terrifying."
dcq0urn,,"So every rich and powerful man who hits on a woman is sexually assaulting her? Does Obama rape his wife every time they have success because he (was) so powerful? My critical reading skills aren't at fault here, it's your critical thinking skills."
dcrtilw,MrVayne,"No, because it's actually possible to request consent in a manner that doesn't intimidate the person you're talking to? Has that really never occurred to you?There's a massive difference between flirting with someone in a relaxed way that doesn't put pressure on them to give consent and doing what Trump describes, which is going up to someone and immediately kissing them or groping them. In the latter case, the man's a billionaire with a TV show and a reputation for going to court over things he doesn't like. If he does exactly what he says he does and grabs a woman by her pussy without even waiting for consent she's got to ask herself if she's willing to risk her job, her career, her reputation and probably tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees to *try* and prosecute him? When he's got a lot more money, a lot more legal experience, much better lawyers and everyone on the jury will already know who he is? When really it's going to come down to her word against his? If she chooses not to take that gamble, which is massively stacked against her, can you honestly say that there's no level of coercion involved in her ""consent""?"
dcodwko,Tipop,"Actually promoting bad science being taught in schools is deemed anti-intellectual. Ignoring scientific consensus is deemed anti-intellectual.Unfortunately, the right is brazen about those things, which means if you lean right, it's assumed you support anti-intellectualism."
dco9o3t,merlinfire,"It's just reflective of the smug elitism that is so endemic to the American Left today. If you disagree with them, you're not just wrong, you're stupid, unintelligent, and are actually against intelligent discourse and learning. It's not that we're tired of ""intelligent people telling us what to do"", we're tired of people who *think they're intelligent* smugly telling us what to do. When the intelligentsia and the left-dominated media can take a world-class pioneering brain surgeon with a doctorate from Yale and 60 honorary doctorates and make him look like a complete fool who couldn't be trusted to tie his own shoelaces, you have to ask: ""how much of this is just bullshit spin?"""
dcofkij,E1C318C1B1045DA2,"Ben Carson is a savant. He's an amazing brain surgeon but that doesn't translate into being a competent administrator. I'm a good programmer which requires a lot of intelligence, but I wouldn't know the first thing about running HUD either.And if you disagree with the scientific consensus on global warming, evolution, cosmology, vaccines, etc, you are anti-intellectual for ignoring people more well-informed than you.How much is bullshit spin? Not a whole lot."
dconqep,marknutter,"So then the same could be said for every liberal with a college degree (that isn't political science). They can't have opinions about anything in politics because they aren't experts. Congratulations, you've just destroyed all discourse."
dcor5em,E1C318C1B1045DA2,"...no...no that's not how it works. Different fields are suitable for different areas of government work. A surgeon could probably do a good job working for the Dept. of HHS. A distinguished computer scientist who has successfully run a large lab or project could be helpful with cybersecurity.A brain surgeon is not a good fit for HUD; and Carson is especially ill-suited because he's shown himself to be somewhat of a dolt, not to mention a religious imbecile. You'll never hear me impune his skills as a surgeon, however. I'd let him operate on my own brain."
dcoegfb,CheeseGratingDicks,Those people who you think are talking down to you are called scholars and experts. It's the people the left are always quoting at you.
dconsm4,marknutter,"It's called ""appealing to authority"", and one of the most popular fallacies that liberals employ when debating people."
dcony7r,CheeseGratingDicks,"I like [this explanation of that fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority). >It's important to note that this fallacy should not be used to dismiss the claims of experts, or scientific consensus."
dcoo3fh,marknutter,"I like how you conveniently cherry picked that one sentence. How about this one, from the same link: ""Appeals to authority are not valid arguments"""
dcoobsu,CheeseGratingDicks,"If the argument is ""X says climate change is real, so there."" That's a logical fallacy. If the argument is, ""According to X's findings climate change is real. Here is the peer reviewed study."", that isn't the ""appealing to authority"" fallacy."
dcp1d28,marknutter,"""X"" is completely irrelevant in your statement above. The study is the relevant bit, and only inasmuch as it is reproducible (which of course, is very difficult if not impossible to do with an observational study with no experimentation). So mentioning ""X"" as though it adds any weight to the argument is absolutely appealing to authority. The study, or rather, the data in the study, should speak for itself."
dcp1qt9,CheeseGratingDicks,Nobody is an expert at everything. So you're either choosing who to trust as an authority on a subject or choosing to operate entirely blindly based on your feelings.
dcp6uyo,marknutter,"But to make a logical argument you can't appeal to authority. It's ok to do it but you have to accept that your argument is made fundamentally weaker by it. I think this where a lot of scientifically minded liberals stumble, because if you're constantly appealing to authority (the scientists) rather than arguing from a foundation that both sides can agree on you've effectively shut down any possibility of enlightenment. It's a great way to feel superior to someone, but a terrible way to convince anyone to change their view. Facts are facts whether or not an expert says so. Having 1 million ""experts"" say that gravity is real doesn't make it *more* real. It's either real, or it's not."
dcocqfi,Chronic_Apathy1,"That doesn't make you right, it just makes you insecure."
dcoghw1,brettins,"I'm left, very secure and confident, and feel the same way about most of the left as the person you're replying to. I think Dave Rubin articulates it the best, and he is certainly not insecure or harmed by these types of comments. The left has become shameful to many of us on the left because of their disdain and looking down on others."
dcoa1u4,,">If you disagree with them, you're not just wrong, you're stupid, unintelligent, and are actually against intelligent discourse and learning. Not to mention you're probably absolutely morally bankrupt, racist, sexist, xenophobic, transphobic, homophobic, and every other thing they can think of to throw at you. They're so convinced of their superiority that disagreeing with them is considered morally wrong."
dcob28o,ygguana,"You are going to have to excuse historically marginalized groups (e.g. LGBTQ) for being concerned when Ol Granpa Trump's appointees and his VP are evangelicals many of whom run on ""traditional family values"" platforms, God first, and trying to stuff god into every crevice. Someone votes for Trump, they are voting for those people by extension, including his future SCOTUS appointee that's likely going to be anti-women's rights and anti-LGBTQ. (Likely under the guise of ""State's rights"") So the voter might not personally feel any particular way about marginalized groups, but action through inaction still falls back on the voters shoulders. Choosing to ignore an issue as ""it doesn't pertain to me"" does not absolve one of responsibility if they enable other parties to perpetuate a particular policy"

Science doesn't have an agenda, it's based on facts, research, methodology, not ideology and rhetoric.I'm sorry all conservatives are grouped up with bigots and racists, I mean that sincerely, but unfortunately bigots and racists tend to largely be conservatives. I know at least half a dozen of Republicans who are very tolerant, socially progressive people; but I know at least triple that amount who are straight up racist bigots.I look down on Trump supporters not because I think I'm smarter or more intelligent, that's a chip on your own shoulder if that's how you take it. I look down on Trump supporters because they continued to support him by ignoring all the evidence and facts that proved he was a lying, naricissistic demagogue.

dcoelga,Tipop,"The reason you get labeled as a racist/bigot etc. when you say you're a conservative is because conservatives have a higher percentage of those types than liberals.The typical stance of a conservative includes such positions as ""my religious beliefs dictate how this country should be run"", or ""the economy is more important than the environment"", or ""people who are sexual deviants should just shut up and go back in their closets"". There's a reason the Klan celebrated Trump's election.You may not support all of these positions, but these positions are closely tied with the political group that you claim as your own, which is why you get labeled."

dcony58,sirbonce,"If ""educated"" is a euphemism for Democrat voters, sure. It's disingenuous and salty to say opposition to generally left-wing views is idiotic. Case in point, I originally supported Rand Paul this past election. He was my first choice.

dcopgro,sirbonce,"What I'm trying to say is that many if not most issues are ridiculously nuanced, containing many ideas and counterpoints about what should/should not be done and why. I'm right-libertarian leaning myself. This does not mean I do not ""believe"" in climate change or a plethora of other issues leftists claim they want government to be more involved in. I just have different ideas of how things should be achieved, and whether or not they interfere with everybody's rights. This does not make me or many other right-leaning people idiots.

It makes things way easier if you can eliminate those that think for themselves and look deeper into things initially before moving on to the rest of the undesirables. Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao, on and on down the line. In each and every example, journalism and education were demonized in favor of nationalism and patriotism. Writers were kidnapped. Generals assassinated. Peaceful protests mercilessly stamped out.From what I understand at least 5 states are currently trying to implement laws with will make public protests illegal.

dcobi3i,sotonohito,"If you try to play by the rules and the other side cheats all the time, they'll win.There are no referees here. The only way to enforce norms and rules is to smack the other side when they break the norms and rules, tit for tat retaliation is necessary in this sort of environment. It sucks, but it's necessary.Trump won because for 35 years the Republicans were flinging shit at Clinton and hoping some of it would stick, and knew that even if none of it stuck it'd at least stink and make people think there was something ""corrupt"" or ""suspicious"" about her. The Republicans paid no price at all for their 35 years of lies and FUD. They impeached Bill Clinton just because they didn't like him and they paid no price.They obstructed Obama to an unprecedented degree and paid no price.As long as they keep getting away with it, as long as there is no price for cheating, they'll keep cheating.**NOW** is the time to smack them hard. Now is the time for the Democrats to anounce that, as payback for the treatment of Obama, they're going to do their best to break the Republican record for filibusters. Trump shouldn't be able to hire a Russian prostitute to piss on him without getting filibustered.Becasue if we don't hurt them back, they'll keep hurting us. There are no referees, there are no rule enforcers, the only thing that keeps them from breaking the rules is fear of retaliation. And if we don't retaliate, they'll break the rules."
dco8jn4,Not_epics_ps4,Too late kiddo
dco8ph0,ADavies,I like facts. But should we be going out of the way to emphasize that he back tracked after he got into politics?
dco99ns,rileymanrr,That's basically exactly how politics goes. Every time somebody runs for any major office you can pull up a list of things they yield on to make themselves more appealing. Is it right? Fuck no. People shouldn't be ashamed of what they believe or they should have beliefs that they don't think are worthy of shame.
dcoakhg,crazykid01,"Exactly, no one understand he acted like a celebrity/ceo most of his life. That means he did things that a politician WOULDN'T do, but a CEO/celebrity don't care if they do or don't do"
dco8rzy,Aaronsaurus,"Intelligent and free speech can have errors. Dismissing other principles, facts or ideas which are otherwise true, at the presence of one error is quite frankly a failing in itself which should be challenged. Alas, people will cry narrative and agenda when debating rather than looking at the information infront of them. I get annoyed of all the anti-Donald crap that is thrown out proportion and context. Attack the man with valid arguments, there's plenty to challenge."
dco9728,dogcatbirdplane,youre going to get dismissed either way because nobody caresthe inevitable slip ups just make it easier for me to ignore you
dco9jrn,Gliste,Look at what sub you're in :) /r/poleftics
dcoazm3,GonnaVote4,"IMO this is how and why trump got elected.It's also why trump can take the term fake news and point it at these media outlets...Attacking him honestly is enough, the misinformation and hyperbole garners him more support"
dco8bac,Pinwurm,"He was sorry he was caught, not sorry he did it.An apology and remorse are two different things. Granted, the second is harder to prove, but its one of those things you know when you see."
dco9nvl,asportking,"I agree with you, but the issue with the quote in question seems to imply that he never did *anything*. In other words, it's easy for one to dismiss the article by saying ""well he did apologize, just look at the video!"" Of course, one could start a dialogue against this argument, but it would be better for the article itself to put forward a more nuanced statement that doesn't make bold claims which, while the essence of them still holds, are technically incorrect."
dcobf5c,rareas,Exactly. Which interpretation is more in line with his ongoing behavior of cutting off planned parenthood and money for women's shelters?
dcocvgl,livevil999,">“I never said I'm a perfect person nor pretended to be someone I'm not,” Trump said. “I've said and done things I regret and the words released today on this more than decade-old video are one of them. These words don't reflect who I am. I said it, I was wrong and I apologize.Its a general blanket apology for things he's said in the past, including this video. That's a pretty bad blanket apology and doesn't speak to specifics or the act in question in any way."
dcoa8ky,Thibbledorf_Pwent,"The point isn't what he apologized for. It's that this is incorrect information. If you ever want to be taken seriously, you need to present facts not feelings."
dcp3q7q,Tellsyouajoke,"Then say he didn't show remorse, not he didn't apologize... however close they seem to most of us, there is a factual difference"
dcuplgl,FranklinTurtzps4,> **He never apologized**. He never showed remorse.
dcob1gk,GonnaVote4,He also didn't boast about sexually assaulting anyone
dcodido,Pinwurm,...What exactly do you think Pussygate was about?
dcof6i0,GonnaVote4,A piggish piece of garbage talking about how a good number of women get aww struck with fame and will do what ever famous people want just to be close to the fame.He talked about it being so bad he could just walk up to them and grab their pussy and they would be ok with it....showed a complete lack of respect for some women.It was also about a hyperbolic media who took a horrible stance like that and tried their best to turn it into sexual assault. They pushed this narrative so hard that people just ignored the actually shitty act because now they were focused on denying it was sexual assault
dcogpx0,Jermermerm,">**I did try and fuck her.** She was married… **I moved on her like a bitch**, but I couldn't get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she's not got the big phony tits and everything... I've got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful. **I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait.** And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.So yeah, you're right about the second half. What about the first part?"
dcoifj5,TrouserTorpedo,"Moved on her means he took her on a date. It means you try it on with someone. ""I moved on her, took her out furniture shopping."" He was trying to buy her affections.If it was sexual assault do you really think he would complain about how he ""couldn't get there?"""
dcojdmo,Jermermerm,">If it was sexual assault do you really think he would complain about how he ""couldn't get there?""Yes actually, that's exactly how I would expect a sexual assailant to react when someone turns them down. And that's besides the point. He has to ""get there"" in order for it to be sexual assault? Anything except fucking doesn't actually count?"
dcolsq2,TrouserTorpedo,"You're deliberate reading me as badly as you possibly can.I don't think that story sounds like sexual assault. I think he took her out on a date, tried to kiss her (which is how most dates work), and she turned him down."
dcon6sr,Jermermerm,"I'm reading you literally, just like I read the quote literally.Nobody cares what ""you think"" happened, or what you interpreted. I'm talking about what he **said** and nothing more. And he doesn't say anywhere that he took her out on a date.What he said, himself, is brag about making a move onto a woman, then used that story as a springboard to brag about how he generally treats women similarly, by kissing and groping them without waiting. You don't just get to go around kissing and groping people. That's sexual assault."
dcoinrh,GonnaVote4,"So he tried to fuck a married woman...doesn't make him a sexual assaulter...calling her a bitch is horrible and piggish and the media should have focused on that instead of the over the top sexual assault claims.he said he kissed her, no mention of her denying his attempts to kiss her, no woman accused him of assaulting her in this manner...so what makes you think he didn't have consent to kiss her?"
dcojzh4,Jermermerm,"The part where ""he couldn't get there"".I mean, I'm assuming the only reason he couldn't get his way is because she wouldn't let him. Either that or he just lost interest all of a sudden, which doesn't seem likely considering he spends the rest of the monologue talking about how he can't help himself."
dcok24d,GonnaVote4,"Yea, he couldn't get her to sleep with him, doesn't mean he couldn't get her to kiss him.i've made out with a lot of woman who didn't want to sleep with me at that time...Trying to sleep with a woman and being turned down isn't sexual assault"
dcokpy1,Jermermerm,"No one argues that.It's more about the part where he moves on her, brags about how ""I don't even wait"", then tries to justify his desire to cheat on his wife with ""It's like a magnet"" as if he can't help himself."
dconb9w,GonnaVote4,All shows he is a pig (the real story) not a sexual assaulter (the overreaching story the media went with)
dconlw9,Jermermerm,"Kissing and/or groping people without ""waiting"" (For what, consent? Permission? Doesn't matter) is sexual assault. You can't just do that to people."
dcoo2ka,GonnaVote4,What do you mean waiting for consent...If you lean in to kiss a woman and they don't back away or object you are a sexual predator because you didn't what...Wait for verbal consent?Every person who leans in for that first kiss is a sexual assaulter?And what grouping trump never said he groped anyone just that he could
dcoolqr,Jermermerm,"...what the fuck?No, you cannot kiss or grope people without their permission. Go ahead, get on the subway and start trying to kiss people. Or go to work and try to grope your secretary."
dco9adx,Janky_Pants,"But all you have to do is say ""fake news"" now and everything becomes false."
dco9b1d,neotek,"While I agree with you that we should be as honest and scrupulous as possible, if this election taught us anything it's that the alt-right have no interest whatsoever in the facts and they need no reason at all to dismiss things they don't agree with. ""Fake news!!!"" is being screamed from the tree tops by a group of people who fell for some of the dumbest, most transparent lies ever told by a human being, let alone a presidential candidate - not about the mountains of horse shit that was shovelled into their mouths by Breitbart and other reprehensible publications but about anything and everything that doesn't conform to their hideously misinformed opinions."
dcoanzm,-kilo-,"Yes, because if 2016 has taught us anything it's that the accuracy of facts matters."
dco8kn8,toolymegapoopoo,They really REALLY don't care.
dco8tiv,RonaldoNazario,"Lol, don't worry, since this was pretty much the only thing he (sort of, mostly) apologized for, we won't have to do this correction very often."
dco8ya1,Blurry12yo,"I hate to say it, but facts don't matter anymore. Literally anything that contradicts our premier's narrative is going to be dismissed as fake news."

dcocwwu,dont_judge_me_monkey,"what a shit a*b*ology it was too, not in person in front of the press but from behind a camera in a closed room and how long did it take. Shows real presidential prowess"
dcodgef,aDildoAteMyBaby,"I disagree entirely. Politics is about impressions, not facts. Trump successfully positioned himself as a populist candidate without using a single fact to back it up. Trump positioned Hillary as a crooked political insider without anything other than her email server. If Trump or the electorate were concerned with facts, he never would have won. People will dismiss whatever stories they want, despite all the facts and consensus to the contrary, if those stories don't fit into their personal narratives. 97% of climate scientists agree in the existence of anthropogenic climate change and it's still an issue. Pope Francis says evolution is not at odds with creationism, but in the US it's still an issue. Despite zero evidence that Obama was born outside the US, only 25% of Republicans believe he's a natural born citizen. If we want to change hearts and minds, we have to stop letting facts and accuracy slow us down so we can start focusing on controlling the narrative. Because if we don't, someone else will."

Doing so would be an admission of guilt which would be a horrible idea. Admitting that he was sorry for speaking the way he did and that he would never act that way was the proper way for him to respond.Unless, of course, you believe that he truly did assault women which, other than the claims of some women who have failed to move forward in any meaningful way with their accusations, there is no evidence of."
dcok20i,polezo,">there is no evidence of.Except you know, his very own words on tape. He was lying one time or another. And also yes the reports of several women, at least some of whom have witnesses that back up their story being told before he ever ran for president. And to your point about them not moving forward, one of the women who claims she was assaulted on the Apprentice is in fact taking him to court."
dcom7z9,Rrkis,"There's equally as much, and I would argue far more, evidence to support him just saying some crap because that's what this dude does constantly. He just runs his mouth, he wants people to like him.There's nothing illegal about just saying some ridiculous, gross stuff just to impress someone. It's petty and pathetic, but apologizing for your words is exactly what you would do in that scenario."
dconykn,polezo,"Obviously it's what he should do strategically, doesn't mean it's the right thing ethically. So your ""evidence"" in favor believing it didn't happen as he described it on tape is the is the fact that he lies running his mouth all the time anyway. Got it. Never mind the fact that multiple women also confirmed this type of behavior (and again, some of them have witnesses who say they heard about attacks before he was running for president), and also nevermind the fact he also once bragged about walking backstage at beauty contests deliberately while contestants were undressing, a brag which was also confirmed by women in the contest. All of those women must lie all the time to get people to like them too, just like that whacky Trump running his mouth!"
dcopeox,Rrkis,"A lot of women also lied about Bill Clinton. Women lie about assaults frequently enough in general, especially when the guy is rich or famous, to warrant suspicion of any claim especially when they all pop up at once during a political campaign.

dcosf74,polezo,"Some women may have lied about Bill, but a lot of women didn't either. Kathleen Wiley and Monica Lewinsky are known to be true to an extent, and Paula Jones is likely as well given the settlement. It's really only Juanita Broadrick who was known to be wholly discredited. (Although Wiley was also discredited for her version of the story--it was fairly well established later that it was consensual and she actively sought the relationship).It's not like people forgot about Bill's indiscretions and abuse of power--he was constantly attacked for them as he should have been. Trump should be held to the same standard as Clinton was at the very least.Obviously there's a ton of issues wrong with Trump, but that doesn't mean we should ignore to this one. It's a still a huge problem as well and absolutely needs to be addressed."

dco8v9j,FolkmasterFlex,"He apologized for talking about what he did, not doing it. He never acknowledged that what he did was illegal."
dcof0qh,,Because talking isn't illegal?
dcog7uv,FolkmasterFlex,I didn't say it was. What he described himself doing is sexual assault.

dcob599,SarahC,He never did do it.
dcoc50t,bnffn,"Don't be a moron, of course he did."

dcodqwn,GonnaVote4,And only one complaint in his life where a woman said it made her uncomfortable that he greeted her with a kiss....Something that is common in other cultures....sorry but the guy is shit....but calling this assault is no different than it technically being assault if I put my hand on your shoulder while asking you to leave
dcoehie,FolkmasterFlex,"I am not talking about what other women said, I am talking about what HE says he does to women. Most sexual assault goes unreported so god forbid we take him at his own word. What he said he does to women is sexual assault."
dcoelg1,GonnaVote4,Because he says he has kissed women as a greeting...that is sexual assault?
dcoeuze,FolkmasterFlex,That he can't stop himself from kissing beautiful women without asking. Are you that delusional that you don't think him talking about grabbing pussy *immediately* after saying this gives a sexual context to what he is saying?
dcofoge,GonnaVote4,"All of it has a gross sexual context, none of it is assault"

It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait."" -Donald J. Trump ) is not sexual assault? yeah, no. I don't even wait is an admission of sexual assault."

dco8mt1,TheTrashMan,"If you want to credibly oppose Trump, you need to stick to the facts and ignore feelings. The other side thrives off arguements based on the lefts ""feelings""."
dco99hx,Daotar,It's a fact that Trump did not apologize for assaulting women.
dcoa8d0,DictatorDictum,"It's not a fact that he ever did. A high-powered man boasting about past sexual conquests in a hyperbolic manner, boy, that is just totally unheard of!"
dcocnb0,Daotar,"I mean, it would be a bit odd if he boasted about it but never did it, especially given his reputation, personality, and the accusations of many women."
dcocs25,DictatorDictum,No it wouldn't. It would make him exactly like every other dude that boasts about how much pussy he gets for being rich and famous. And how many of those accusations disappeared after the election?
dcodvq4,DreamcastStoleMyBaby,You must be slow. We aren't talking about other politicians here. If we gave a shit about other candidates we would have brought them up ourselves! Fucking trumpie's whiteknights
dcoezzm,DictatorDictum,Who gives a fuck about politicians? I'm talking about average joes and tons of other celebrities that boast about how they're drowning in pussy.
dco990a,ArtMustBeFree,"Nothing about what they wrote was feelings. Donald Trump apologized that people heard his statement, not for his actions or the promotion of other people in power to do the same.That's a fact."
dco98n6,flossdaily,"I am sticking to the facts. He minimizes the wrong doing, dismissing it as ""foolish"" talk. Then says we would move on to ""important"" issues. Unmistakably categorizing this as unimportant.It's not a matter of opinion to say this was insincere and dismissive. Objectively it was both."
dco9upy,American_Libertarian,"Insincere and dismissive are both entirely subjective concepts. Saying the words ""I apologize"", however, is objectively an apology even if you dont like the quality of it. It is important for these kinds or articles to be factually correct."
dcofpx8,Steams,Do you think the point of an apology is simply that it is technically made? There is a reason we place value on genuine apologies
dcou2q6,American_Libertarian,"When we are discussing the factual validity of an article, yes. What technically happened is what is very important. Whether you accept his apology or not, whether you subjectively liked it or not, it objectively happened and the article explicitly says it did not happen. When running these kinds of articles, it is incredibly important to be factually correct. With all the slander and accusations of fake news going around, the media will soon become 100% ignored by the entire Republican party if you give them an excuse to. If you want to run negative articles on trump, do exactly that. It isn't hard to use facts to make him look bad. A big part of the reason he won is because slander journalism stretched the truth and based their whole news cycles on entirely subjective matter, leading to many people entirely disregarding it. If the media is objective and factual, Trump's career will end much sooner."

dcodybt,DictatorDictum,"Yeah, I know it's sexual assault, I'm saying there's no proof of it actually happening. And the fact that almost all of those alleged sexual assault cases dropped immediately after the election makes it seem more like a convenient political smear than an actual issue. I'll reconsider when any actual proof comes out and not a boast from a rich and famous guy about how he gets a ton of pussy very easily.And let's not beat around the bush with the rappers talking about murder. They frequently boast about the exact same thing Trump boasted about, except it's not uncommon for a rapper to boast about those things openly on many songs.

dcp9dx9,DictatorDictum,"Yeah, he's been a chauvinist and a bit of a pig in the past. That's rough. But parading women around, briefly kissing them on the lips (isn't this a greeting in certain parts of the world?), and calling them fat ain't even close to rape.Bill Clinton had an intern blow him (while President, so talk about uneven power dynamics). He went through a civil lawsuit for it and was impeached for lying during that case. The woman who broke the scandal [received death threats immediately afterwards and had to be moved to a safe house](http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/05/27/tripp/). He has also been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. And yet Clinton is remembered quite fondly around here. His accusers, who had as much proof of rape as Trump's accusers, are routinely trounced by supporters and ignored by the media. Not only is Trump's situation not unprecedented, it's precedented by the guy who was President a whole 3 Presidents ago and also the husband (by choice) of the candidate who was frequently fellated around these parts for the past couple years.So I don't buy for a second that this a serious issue for /r/politics, or more people would be more consistent on this point and call out Hillary for her continued relationship with a man who is just as ""guilty"" as Trump. I'm more than sure that it's just a convenient line of anti-Trump rhetoric, bolstered by the resurgence of political correctness and feminism, that is conveniently forgotten when the ""good guys"" do the exact same thing. Wasn't there a video of Bill Clinton checking out some ass at the inauguration today, upvoted to the tippy top of /r/all? But that's just good fun. When Trump ogles women, he's clearly lower than pond scum."

The hypocrisy of the hatred for Trump for what one of the most beloved ex-Presidents is guilty of as well is not irrelevant.Anyway, yeah, social programs are probably going to take a back seat for a while. The program you mentioned looks to be one of many, many government funded programs to possibly be cut, so it's not like it's just deliberate, malicious targeting and apathy towards women. Eggs, omelets, etc. If Trump sticks to his word, there's going to be a massive downturn in federal spending, and that means sacrifices are going to be made and private industry/charity is going to have to pick up the slack if people want these programs to stick around (assuming they're cut in the final budget)."

dco93kt,SoraXavier,"I think the argument there is that what he said wasn't a *real* apology, and only introduced further sexist/patriarchal ideas. I agree that it's pretty irresponsible to have a sentence like that where any dissenter can quickly say, ""nope, he apologized, FAKE NEWS!"" And dismiss the whole article. Perhaps better would have been to mention his half-assed apology and say that many did not think it good enough considering the gravity of the situation. But what do I know, I'm not a journalist."
dco9cit,FranklinTurtzps4,"I'm not discounting the article as a whole, I just saw that part and it glared out to me as a 100% lie, because he did technically apologize, even though we don't know if he meant it or not. You can't say someone didn't do something when they in fact did, even though a person thinks or feels like the thing they did wasn't meaningful enough."

The only part of the whole video that could be construed as an ""apology"" is,> I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.Now, this wording was reached, I imagine, after hours of carefully constructing a response with his campaign team. He clearly didn't want to apologize, as he had never apologized in his life. So the agreement was to simply state ""I apologize,"" without any further description or address.Is he apologizing for what he was saying? Is he apologizing for the fact it was wrong? Is he apologizing for his cavalier and sexist attitude? Is this a blanket apology for any sexual misconduct in his past?Or is he apologizing at all? Is he just naming the action of an apology? Is this just a descriptor to erect the facade of this public address: a rote apology because he had to?My guess is the latter."
dcobxbp,goodfreeman,He apologized for *the words* but not the actions. He takes no responsibility for the actions he is claiming he takes part in. That is a very different thing.

dcob9i6,TastyBrainMeats,"At that point, people were less hoping for a perfect President, more just hoping for a better one than they'd had previously."
dcobl5y,kemosabi4,Is that an excuse for allowing him to get away with it?

dcocd9f,kemosabi4,You've only had eight fucking years.
dcodarn,TastyBrainMeats,"And believe me, I *have* been mad as hell at Obama over some of his decisions.But any discussion of his Presidency, as of today, is strictly a historical debate. It's too late to affect his decisions, because he's no longer behind the desk."
dcok13g,AnnakinTheMannequin,I strongly disagree with those viewpoints. But the world isn't black and white or red and blue. Those are bad policies. Trump is a bad person and going to bring our country much further backwards.
dconx02,Xelif,"So Trump is going to end the drone program, yes?"
dcoortt,kemosabi4,"No, but the difference is that liberals are actually going to criticize it this time."

dcojjin,Floorguy1,"Alright, I'll ask these questions: 1.).Were there the same amount of international conflicts during the Bush years than Obama's?2.)

The *real* police come when you rape someone.""EDIT:As pointed out by /u/dragonnyxx ...

dcodnzb,CoffeeandBacon,"People just post that Limbaugh quote out of context to make him look bad. I doubt you've even listened to the full excerpt. Isn't there a better way to disagree with or decry republicans than to smear them with dishonest piecemeal quotes?To paraphrase: He's talking about hypocrisy, and that he's frustrated that republicans are frequently strung up with claims of hypocrisy but it never attaches itself to the democrats. He is saying that it's extremely hypocritical that the left is very strong on consent as if that's the only thing that makes a sex act good or decent, when him and many others believe that there are a lot more moral standards related to sex that can make it otherwise bad or unwholesome or damaging and rape is only one of them. So for the left to ignore everything else is pretty blind and hypocritical. That's it. So, this quote is pretty stupid to me. He's not a rape advocate, he just thinks that it's hypocritical that that's the only thing people are concerned about when it comes to sex. Now these aren't my thoughts, but you can understand where he's coming from while disagreeing with him. I think that he talks in kind of a stupid, far-right manner, but if you understand what he's trying to say this quote is just a non-issue.Here's the full quote below>Okay now to this story on hypocrisy. We like talk here about hypocrisy all the time and we wring our hands and we express our frustrations; how come hypocrisy never attaches itself to the democrats and yet when it comes to republicans it has become a crime? Hypocrisy is a crime when republicans are caught with it, and yet it never even attaches to democrats. So there's a piece her called The Ugly Stench of Hypocrisy by Michael J Herd PHD, the most insightful thing I've read about the Donald Trump Sex Scandal is this…, “How Ironic then that a culture that rejects moral standards..” Make no bones about it folks, we do! “Moral standards, you stand up for moral standards you're going to be laughed out of the room! You're going to be called a prude, a Victorian, an old fuddy duddy, and old fogey, and they're going to claim you want to deny people having a good time. So, a culture which rejects moral standards, in other words anything goes. You know what the magic word, the only thing that matters in American sexual mores today? The one thing, you can do anything, the left will promoe and understand and tolerate anything as long as there is one element. Do you know wha tit is? Consent. If there is consent on both or all three or four o how ever many are involved in the sex act, it's perfectly fine, whatever it is. But if the left ever senses and smells that there's no consent in part of the equation, here comes the rape police. But consent is the magic key to the left.You can hear him say it here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rush-limbaugh-consent_us_57fee9aae4b0e8c198a6076d"
dcoglkx,km89,"The full quote is even worse. First, it implies that not only is consent not necessary, it's also not as important as whatever he thinks good sex should be. Not only is he an asshole for the consent thing, he's also got his nose in everyone's pants waiting to see whether they're doing something he doesn't approve of."
dcoh5gq,CoffeeandBacon,"You're just wrong, plain and simple. It goes from being purely dismissive of consent and rape to making a more coherent, though very debatable, point. The points you bring up are valid and arguable, but his comments are not as bad as if he just downplayed the importance of consent or the problem of rape. It's dishonest to post that little snippet without context. Even if it **is** ""worse with context, it becomes an entirely different point with context and that's enough to warrant including the context. What's the point of being so eager to smear someone that you're willing to misrepresent them?"
dcohnn5,km89,"I don't feel as though I'm misrepresenting him. Context of morality included, ""But if the left ever senses and smells that there's no consent in part of the equation, here comes the rape police"" is a statement unto itself that is not contradicted or even modified by the context it's in.Legally and ethically, consent is required for consensual sex, full-stop. Mocking the idea of consent as if it's some stuck-up liberal fluff is itself a reprehensible statement. But the context doesn't do anything at all to alleviate that. There's no mention of ""obviously, you can't go around raping people."" There's no implication that the left it *overly* concerned with the explicit words of consent--the South Park episode with the frat guy asking for her written consent and holding out a written form comes to mind as the type of mocking argument that actually *does* make that point, but Limbaugh's words do not make that point at all. In fact, the context only *strengthens* my point. Limbaugh's words imply that there are some forms of sex that are just plain morally *wrong*, and moreover that those forms of sex are *more* wrong than non-consensual sex. I really don't feel as though I'm misrepresenting his point at all."
dco8qca,CoolGuySean,That is NOT an accurate paraphrase.
dco8sza,km89,"I disagree. The elements are all there:He's really rich, ""we've never seen this kind of wealth in the White House"".""Traditional rules don't work,"" which is just a blatant rephrasing of ""we really can't expect to hold him to the same laws and standards."""
dcofczt,CoolGuySean,"""Now remember, he's very rich and we can't really expect to hold him to the same laws and standards of other people.""This misquote implies that people shouldn't expect that the usual rules apply to him.""We've never seen this kind of wealth in the White House, and so traditional rules don't work. We're going to have to think up a whole new approach.""This actual quote is saying the usual techniques won't work and that we need a new approach when dealing with him because he is rich. This is a statement about how to deal with him, not holding him to a different standard. Dealing with someone and holding them to different standards are different things."
dcoaaww,tomdarch,"As I suspect Limbaugh actually knows, no, there are no police coming to arrest you when you sexually assault a woman and you are ""a star."""
dco79g1,pm-me-neckbeards,I still can't believe this is a real thing he said.
dco7g3a,big_hungry_joe,It's shit like this that makes me proud i'm never going to relate to right wing scumbags like him.
dco7vod,Z00T_Allures,"Do you always ask a girl if you can kiss them before you do it? No because a lot of girls like it when you are up front about your attraction to them. Of course it can be taken to far but he said that in private to his buddy, don't be so coy it doesn't make you a better person."
dco8iso,pm-me-neckbeards,"There is a difference between being on a date, vibing with the other person and going in for a kiss and then walking into a room and forcefully kissing someone you are supposed to be having a business meeting with. Or grabbin' their pussy."
dco88qb,big_hungry_joe,"Do you always not tell a girl before you just grab their genitals without their permission? I love how you people consistently gloss over that part. Also, he was married."
dco82zw,Rickrickrickrickrick,Trying to kiss a girl is a lot different than grabbing her by the pussy.
dcoe7iq,Z00T_Allures,he didn't actually grab any girls pussy you know. Lots of dudes talk about fucking chicks with their friends that they know that they would never actually get the chance to go through with.
dco840q,1MonthFreeTrial,Kissing is a whole lot different than pussy grabbing.
dcob1v9,,If you're getting the right signals going in for the pussy is the right thing to do.

dcoiesy,unhampered_by_pants,"I don't think that there are any ""signals"" that okay a person walking up to someone and grabbing their genitalia in public, c'mon now."
dcoirjg,,Who said anything about being in public? Or just walking up to someone?
dco8759,j_la,"An important ingredient of this is also the fact that women have come forward and said ""I did not consent to Trump's touching and kissing"". So he *thinks* he has their consent, but he did not always have it."
dco8963,,"Trump himself admitted that he can't even withstand kissing beautiful women. Your argument is not only weak, it's possibly the weakest argument you could have made."
dcoeylk,Z00T_Allures,I don't think its weak at all. you say that like he is going around mouth raping women. get over yourself jackass
dczp1gm,,"I think you need to get over yourself if you think imposing yourself on women to the extent that Trump claims to is acceptable.Wouldn't surprise me if a lot of women had stories about you trying to hit on them, and them declining."
dcodotk,Kexizzoc,"Kissing is a false analogy.""Consent"" seems idiotic when it's a college male on a campus poster saying ""can I kiss you"" through doey eyes and One Direction hair. Consent has NOTHING to do with being more shy, timid, or less confident. I say this because it seems like a lot of impressionable college males end up thinking their being asked to act ""less alpha"". Everyone, in one way or another, needs to ask consent of their partner, and the better you know a person (and less compromised your faculties) the easier that is. When I ask my wife for her consent, it's not fucking polite, and we don't need words (after the first year of dating), but it still has to happen."
dcofnr4,Z00T_Allures,"If you understand consent without literal verbal consent then so does trump. Get off of your intellectual high horse. Trump was talking to his friend in private about hypothetically putting moves on a hot chick. I've done it and so have you probably, lots of guys do. He's very rich and he's actually pretty talented and funny, girls like those traits. He can probably get away with flirting with women more than you or I can and they will probably let him do more in less time than you or I could. Sometimes my wife wants me to warm her up, sometimes she wants me to just take advantage of her. Dude bangs supermodels, he knows how to read women"
dco9o2y,siva115,I hope to whatever deity may or may not exist that you're trolling and not actually this stupid.
dcog961,Z00T_Allures,Oh Yeah? You're stupid!
dco7zs3,monkeybreath,"He did, but he also said at the same time that crazy debauchery was also ok as long as there is consent. I think that's the point he was trying to make, the progressives were depraved, since consent made anything ok. Which is true (about consent), but to social conservatives that just makes progressives look like a bunch of sickos."
dco84nc,pm-me-neckbeards,"It's almost like ""the left"" believe people have the freedom to use their genitals how they see fit as long as everyone involved is a consenting adult. You'd think that'd be a small government, pro-freedom stance. And let's not pretend for a second that conservatives don't do the same dirty shit in bed that liberals do."
dco8zyn,monkeybreath,"I'm not disagreeing with you, just pointing out what he was thinking."
dcodvpq,CoffeeandBacon,So you admit this quote is a non issue and that's he's not dismissing rape? Ok.
dcogc46,pm-me-neckbeards,"I never said he was dismissing rape. But I think he is downplaying the importance of consent and putting too much emphasis on the importance of having the ""right kind"" of sex. He seems to imply that the fact that ""the left"" only cares about consent is somehow morally lacking, because they are fine with people consenting to the ""wrong"" sex acts."
dcogspi,CoffeeandBacon,"The problem is that when people use that little snippet alone, it absolutely seems to be dismissive of consent and rape! The whole quote is making an entirely different point and it's very debatable, as you're pointing out, I just think it's completely dishonest to post that one part with no context."

dcofy90,pm-me-neckbeards,"I don't think his point is reasonable in context is the thing. He is implying that the left is so deviant all they care about is consent, as if consent is not the most important part of a sexual relationship. His statement is not better in context.

dcoiqtd,MusicianNALawyer,"I'll make a rare and hopefuly brave admission for a non-throwaway account: I was in a country in which prostitution happens often. I decided, hey, it's cheap, and I don't speak the language here, so why not give it a shot. For me, it was the most boring thing ever, because there is beauty in consent (which of course I had), but also getting to know someone, and knowing they care about you both sensually and sexually, that they consent to you in every way possible.Let me preface this statement with the fact that rape and sexual assault are wrong, and a complete violation of women. But I can hardly imagine how it would be with someone who was actually saying ""no."" What kind of sick fuck does that? It's a sick, disgusting power play, that only showcases the lack of respect for women, and the lack of true confidence in being a man, because you have to force it to get it. Donald Trump is a coward."
dcoff3v,zorinlynx,I never understood it either. There is nothing sexy or appealing about nonconsensual sex. Maybe some people are just wired wrong in the head. Things are best when everyone involved is having a wonderful time; this applies to any life activity.

You're going to be called a prude, a Victorian, an old fuddy duddy, and old fogey, and they're going to claim you want to deny people having a good time. So, a culture which rejects moral standards, in other words anything goes. You know what the magic word, the only thing that matters in American sexual mores today? The one thing, you can do anything, the left will promoe and understand and tolerate anything as long as there is one element. Do you know wha tit is? Consent. If there is consent on both or all three or four o how ever many are involved in the sex act, it's perfectly fine, whatever it is. But if the left ever senses and smells that there's no consent in part of the equation, here comes the rape police. But consent is the magic key to the left.You can hear him say it here: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rush-limbaugh-consent_us_57fee9aae4b0e8c198a6076d"
dcoeee0,ILikeLenexa,"> that the left is very strong on consent as if that's the only thing that makes a sex act good or decent,That's a stupid thing to say, the left holds consent as the main bar that makes sex **legal**.> him and many others believe that there are a lot more moral standards related to sex that can make it otherwise bad or unwholesome [...] is pretty blind and hypocriticalReally, Rush Limbaugh and his 4 wives is complaining about ""wholesomeness"" of sex. The idea you're stating that adultery or homosexuality is somehow on the same level as rape and should be legislated against on the same level is exactly the insanity people are complaining about."
dcofndh,CoffeeandBacon,"I never said it was on the same level. I said he thinks there are more issues than one and that was his only point. Disagree all you want, that's great, but this still isn't the rape-advocating quote it's portrayed as."
dcohjlq,,"The fact that you think this is some sort of defense tickles me. Who cares what his overall point was? Just because he wanted to bitch about moral relativism in American culture doesn't mean his words are meaningless. This in no way changes the content of his little rant. Edit- You are not saying this, but Rush almost certainly is comparing them. It's pretty clear. It's just not defensible. This isn't a ""liberals are such pussies"" type thing. It's an ignorant rant by an ignorant person."
dcoi5xu,CoffeeandBacon,"I disagree. I think that this is a point that is very much changed by the context and that it's pointless to remove it. The point he ends up making is an obvious jab at the left but it's definitely not ""consent isn't that important and rape isn't a big problem."" That's what it seems like if you leave the standalone quote. If you can't see the difference I think you're just too eager to see controversy instead of have an accurate assessment of someone who disagrees with you. The point he makes is different and yes, very debatable. But it's different. And that's reason enough to not take it out of context."
dcoik3j,,"But his actual point is making a comparison between rape and homosexuality. That might almost be worse, since he's saying that they are basically the same thing. Just because in his mind they aren't dissimilar and his point is that there are more moral considerations than consent doesn't make him any less wrong."
dcojjud,CoffeeandBacon,"You're so stubborn, Jesus. I know what he's saying and I said yeah, it's debatable. I don't think he said they're equivalent, but I don't give a shit at this point. I don't give a shit about any of that, it was never my point. All I'm saying is that he's not simply downplaying rape and consent like they're not important. And the context which was not included makes that clear, so if shouldn't be left out, though it often is. That's all I've been trying to say. If you can't agree with that simple point, that we shouldn't twist the facts of what someone is saying, I don't know what to say."
dcolbot,,"I think I understand the point you are trying to make, but I am stubborn because I think you are wrong. I agree with you that saying he is *only* talking about rape not being particularly notable is disingenuous. However, he *is* still saying thatIt's as if someone was talking about how whites aren't a superior race, but blacks are obviously inferior. This person may not be a white *supremecist​*, but what he is saying comes out to the same thing."
dcooa9o,CoffeeandBacon,"A more accurate, analogous comparison to me would be Black Lives Matter. It's not that white lives don't matter, it's just that black lives also matter. That's their whole premise. Are white people wrong for only focusing on themselves if they're ignoring black people? Yes. Limbaugh would say that Democrats are wrong for only focusing on consent when other moral standards are neglected. He's not mocking consent, He's mocking *the left's obsession with consent at the expense of all else*, and the hypocrisy of that. Again, it's his values that are being neglected in this scenario, but that's beside the point. That's nothing new. I think you're being unfair and reading it wrong. Just a misunderstanding to he's downplaying consent, but I think it's more likely that he's simply mocking the left. His whole bit was about hypocrisy."
dco6x87,Grace_Wincer,"Well when the President does it, that means it is not illegal."
dcod3py,terranq,That is pretty much a real Trump quote.
dcodz73,Grace_Wincer,It's actually a Nixon quote.

dco8i2s,inconspicuous_male,And yet I *still* see Bernie supporters talking about how bad Hillary was...
dcoali2,Sarks,"I'm from the UK, and here people *know* Trump is fucking bent as nine bob note. Pretty much no one in Scotland has anything close to a neutral opinion of him from what I've seen. Hilary, on the other hand, people seem to like. Basically, it boils down to Trumps supporters know he's scum. They just don't care. Hilary's supporters seem to think she's on the side of the angels. But again, I'm across the pond, so that's just my 2p."

dcof8ji,Sarks,"True, true, she probably was the better choice. But the lesser of two evils is still evil (not saying she's evil, just trying to make a point)."
dcofpcx,inconspicuous_male,"But she's not the lesser of two evils. She has been hated for inconsequential things for decades, but if you were to look at her accomplishments with no commentary attached, she would seem to be a pretty good candidate"
dcol1a3,Apt_5,"It's true that a large number of people who voted for Trump did so just to get their team the win and stick it to the other half of the country. Hillary wasn't the perfect candidate, but that's an improbable standard. Compared to what we got she looks pretty awesome; elevation by contrast. Yay Brexit redux!"
dcodsf2,OrangeCarton,They're just (understandably) salty about Bernie.
dcofd4x,inconspicuous_male,And that's the most frustrating part of the whole year in my opinion
dcohakd,ranchojasper,"My oldest friend is one of these. He has lost his mind; his obsession with Hillary Clinton is so concerning I spent some time last year researching late-onset schizophrenia (he's in his mid-30s, which is about 5-8 years later than symptoms usually start to appear). Lifelong, diehard progressive who originally was just a big Bernie supporter but he absolutely went crazy with Wikileaks. He is literally spending today posting random DNC emails every hour that don't actually say anything, as a ""reminder"" to ""us"" (other, normal progrsssives who haven't gone batshit crazy) that it's our fault Trump was elected. First email was an internal DNC email about Hillary's top opponents, written and sent *a full month before Bernie even announced his candidacy.* Meaning at that time, *Hillary was the ONLY democratic candidate!* But still, this is *proof* to this PhD-holding scientist that Hillary is Voldemort and Bernie never had a chance. Sigh"
dcobo0r,Darkben,"I mean, Hillary _is_ bad. She was pretty much the worst candidate the DNC could have run with"
dcofhrw,inconspicuous_male,"Yes, that is exactly what the propaganda told me too... She isn't. She really is not bad. I believed she was too, until the Podesta leaks when I realized everything she was criticized for was blown way out of proportion by people who (successfully) wanted to divide and destroy the Democratic party. You're the people Putin took advantage of."
dcofkua,Darkben,"Firstly, I'm British, so Putin hasn't touched me. Secondly, she has a reputation that the emails didn't do much to smooth over."
dcogdov,inconspicuous_male,"Actually, Putin's goal was to influence opinions, largely through the internet and social media. So unless you're on the purely non-American internet, you've been exposed to the same propaganda campaign as the rest of us. And her reputation was bad before she ever held public office. When her husband was running for governer of Arkansas, people didn't like that she didn't have a southern accent. Once she became first lady of Arkansas, she picked up an accent. People didn't trust that. From that point on, everything she did (still many years before she was a member of congress) was criticized as being phoney. People have looked for ways to spin all of her actions as negative and to make mountains out of molehills for every little mistake since the beginning of her career. Her reputation has very little to do with her actions. She was no worse SOS than most others, she was no more of a warmonger than any of the recent Presidents, and the Podesta emails actually revealed some conversations saying how she had little intention of giving in to the Wall Street lobbyists requests if they hurt the economic well-being of the lower classes."
dcogqe9,Darkben,Clinton's campaign offered absolutely nothing in a presidential race that was clearly going to be won by a candidate who could offer substantial change. You don't get to be surprised she lost.
dcoh1tt,inconspicuous_male,"Woah woah woah we went from ""She has a horrible record"" to ""I'm surprised she lost and Bernie was the only candidate with good features""? Do you think if a candidate isn't Bernie, then they're nobody? Because that's not what Bernie says. I agree that Bernie would have done a lot more good, but that doesn't mean Hillary would have done *nothing*"
dcohkgz,Darkben,"How did you go from 'Hillary was a bad choice who offered nothing' to 'Bernie was the only candidate with good features'?It's not about what they would have done. The general public has had enough of establishment politics. That much was, and is, clear."
dcolqsx,inconspicuous_male,The point you were making in your first comment is not the same as the points you have made in your following comments. The discussion was originally about how you think Hillary is terrible. Now it's that establishment politics is terrible
dcomdn2,Darkben,Hillary is an establishment politician. The two go hand in hand.
dcog6al,ReturningTarzan,"Well, she lost to Donald Trump. That's pretty bad."
dcoipz3,unhampered_by_pants,There were some external factors in her losing to Trump that had nothing to do with her merits or qualifications.
dco90dq,IlikeJG,"Just because Trump is worse, doesn't mean Hillary gets carte blanche."
dcob6us,patientbearr,I never said she should. But both should be treated equally.

dconhwb,ranchojasper,"Yes, exactly. As a progressive, I'm pretty much of belief that anyone should pose naked as much as they want, marry whomever they want, have kids with whomever they want, etc. The hypocrisy is what just boils my blood."
dconz5g,Ridry,The interesting thing is that many on the right believe that too. Government meddling in private affairs is quite abhorrent to a lot of the small government types.

It just means he gropes womenYou've never finger banged a girl before? Nothing about that necessarily implies ""groping"".Anyways, I asked you ""How is that not a valid interpretation of his words."" Your response was to just double down and assert your interpretation, without giving me good reason to think the alternate interpretation -- groupies consented to his advances -- is accurate.Here is [another comment I made in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5p3s9c/man_boasts_of_sexual_assault_later_inaugurated/dco7zfl/):> In all seriousness, there are someone's words, and there are our interpretations of someone's words. One interpretation is that Trump was talking about women being too petrified to do anything about his grabbing them, and that he could get away with this sexual assault and they wouldn't do anything about it. Another interpretation is that he is basically talking about groupies and is acting amazed that they consent to sexual activity because of one's fame and/or fortune.> Both interpretations are logically consistent with his phrasing. But you will of course find his political opponents leaping to the worst possible interpretation, pretending as if this interpretation was hard fact. And you will find his supporters defending the best possible interpretation until they are blue in the face, and will only back down when a ridiculously high bar of proof has been met that he meant something else."

They may not even have to do anything--hell, even assault victims of ordinary people can even be made to feel like no one will believe them.

dcofbo4,BASEDME7O,It's really not. By that logic the president can never have sex
dcofvtc,,[deleted]
dcow5lb,Yumeijin,"You're right, it isn't sexual assault in the legal sense. The notion that it is is entirely my opinion under the reasoning a person is in a position of subordination, they are incapable of making consent in the same way as one where the power dynamic does not exist."
dcolzxt,ranchojasper,"No. It was not sexual assault. He didn't coerce her. It was 100% consensual. Yes, he had more power in the situation, but she has never once even remotely intimated that she did not desire him. She was not underage remotely and she wanted to hook up with him; even now she says that. This difference is **INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.**"
dcotd8z,Yumeijin,You can't legitimize consent when someone has power over you. It is always possible that there is even a subconscious influence.
dco9851,not_even_once_okay,"I think a lot of people on r/all are going to have a hard time understanding that. It's true, but I don't think you're going to be able to convince reddit of that."
dco83x5,,He has been accused of rape by multiple women.
dco8qvy,bucklaughlin57,"None have any standing. Juanita Broderick used Clinton as an excuse when her husband noticed the fat lip given to her by her (also married) lover""Rumors circulated about Broaddrick's allegations for many years, but she refused to speak to the media. In a sworn statement in 1997 with the placeholder name ""Jane Doe #5,""[1] Broaddrick filed an affidavit with Paula Jones' lawyers stating there were unfounded rumors and stories circulating ""that Mr. Clinton had made unwelcome sexual advances toward me in the late seventies... These allegations are untrue"". '"
dcocgav,,"Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones also both accused Bill Clinton of rape as well. To say they ""have no standing"" is to say you don't believe the victim."
dcogq4j,Mind_Reader,"Kathleen Willey never accused him of rape - she accused him of assault. She's also a nut who was obsessed with Bill, and plotted to try and set up meetings between herself and Clinton. She would go to events where she thought he would would be, wearing a black dress she thought he liked. She also gave false information to the FBI about being assaulted by a former boyfriend (which she admitted to when they confronted her), she changed her testimony a number of times, and had a history of lying to her boyfriend, telling him she was pregnant and she had a miscarriage when she didn't.Paula Jones also did not accuse him of rape - she accused him of sexual harassment. Right after she filed, she hired a woman known for bashing the Clintons to the conservative press, who wasted no time going to the media to bash him as ""un-American"", a ""liar"", and a ""philanderer"". Her case was dismissed before it even got to trial, and Clinton settled when she filed for appeal. Before litigation was even over, she went around to the media to show the results of a makeover, and posed for Penthouse a year later."
dcol06r,,"All I'm hearing is ""I don't believe the victim."""
dcom2gd,Mind_Reader,"Linda Tripp testified under oath that Willey's sexual contact with President Clinton in 1993 was consensual, that Willey had been flirting with the President, and that Willey was happy and excited following her 1993 encounter with Clinton. Six other friends of Willey confirmed Tripp's account and that Willey had sought a sexual relationship with the President.You're damn right I don't believe a woman who has a history of lying about assault, pregnancy and miscarriages and whose own friends testify that she's lying. It makes it harder for every woman who is actually assaulted to come forward."
dcoqddx,,"Paula Jones then? She doesn't have a history of lying. Juanita Broderick doesn't either. Because you don't want to. Your ""believe the victim"" narrative only extends as far as your political ideology. Let's be real, if the same exact situation happened to Trump you'd probably be harping on about how she was ""silenced."" My point is if you don't believe these victims, then pushing Trump as a rapist/ sexual molestor is hypocritical."
dcosq5u,Mind_Reader,">Paula JonesOf all the women, she is probably the most believable.According to Paula Jones, on May 8, 1991, Jones, then a 24 year old civil servant in the office of the Governor of Arkansas, was escorted to Clinton's hotel room in Little Rock, Arkansas where he propositioned her and exposed his penis.Although this is the behaviour of a creep, it wasn't sexual assault.The Paula Jones case went through the courts for quite some time, eventually leading to the judge dismissing it, ruling Jones had not shown she suffered damages and failed to show Clinton's actions were ""outrageous conduct.""The dismissal was appealed, and the Clinton team eventually settled, claiming they just wanted the case to be over. President Clinton was never found guilty of sexual harassment, nor did he admit to any wrong doing.>Juanita Broderick doesn't either.What? After she claimed he raped her, she continued to support Clinton's campaign for governor, and even appeared in public on his behalf. Now that in and of itself wouldn't be that unusual. However Broaddrick signed a deposition, under oath, stating that no sexual contact had occurred with Bill Clinton.So while I feel that President Clinton was a womanizer, and crossed a decency line with Jones, I don't think he is anywhere near what you're claiming him to be. > Let's be real, if the same exact situation happened to Trump you'd probably be harping on about how she was ""silenced."" Do you support Trump? If you believe Clinton is so bad, you must hate Trump. >My point is if you don't believe these victims, then pushing Trump as a rapist/ sexual molestor is hypocritical.I believe victims until they give me reason not to. The woman who accused Clinton have histories of lying about these claims, have evidence thats disproves them, and have made contradictory statements under oath. These are reasons why I no longer believe their claims. I believe the women who have accused Trump, for one, because Trump himself, in his own words, admitted to doing those very things. These women also have people who independently corroborate their stories. In short, until they do something to make me doubt their stories, I believe them."
dcqeude,,"> Although this is the behaviour of a creep, it wasn't sexual assault.That's literally sexual assault.> ruling Jones had not shown she suffered damages and failed to show Clinton's actions were ""outrageous conduct.""So a victim says she was damaged by sexual assault and you say...nah don't think so lady, men do know what's best for you after all.> The dismissal was appealed, and the Clinton team eventually settled, claiming they just wanted the case to be over. Guilty.> Do you support Trump? If you believe Clinton is so bad, you must hate Trump.I don't believe either one of them are bad. I think all these charges are obviously bogus, and I think people are monstrous hypocrites for wanting to believe the victim in Trump's case even though it's based on jack shit, yet will pick apart all the women who accused Clinton like you just did. Because it fits your narrative. You don't want Clinton to be a rapist so you don't see him that way, even though multiple women have accused him of indecent behavior and he has a history of a womanizer. But Trump says one thing on a tour bus twenty years and it means he's a rapist, 100%. Like...the double think is crazy to me.> I believe the women who have accused Trump, for one, because Trump himself, in his own words, admitted to doing those very things. These women also have people who independently corroborate their stories.Pfft, all those women had corroborated stories as well. Nothing has gone to court yet. You have NO IDEA how true the stories are. They are 100% unsubstantiated. You believe them because you dislike Trump. period."
dcqgz3h,Mind_Reader,">That's literally sexual assault.No, it isn't. It's harassment, not assault. >So a victim says she was damaged by sexual assault and you say...nah don't think so lady, men do know what's best for you after all.No, she wasn't assaulted. She claims he exposed himself - not that he assaulted her. >nah don't think so lady, men do know what's best for you after all.Strawman. Please quote where I said this. > GuiltyFirst, it wasn't a criminal trial, so no ""guilt"". Second, by it's very nature, the settlement was not an admission of guilt. Unless you also believe that Trump is guilty for fraud and *actual* sexual assault, since he settled cases as well? Those play no part in my opinion on Trump. >will pick apart all the women who accused Clinton like you just did. Because Clinton's are over 20 years ago and have been ""picked apart"" to death by the media - we literally know all this because we've seen this play out. Also stating the facts of the case is not ""picked apart"".>Because it fits your narrative. So exactly what you're doing with Clinton? >But Trump says one thing on a tour bus twenty years and it means he's a rapist, 100%. Like...the double think is crazy to me.He said it 10 years ago, not 20 and Clinton never admitted he assaulted women on tape! **Trump openly bragged about doing this.** When some one says something like that, and thinks no one of consequence will hear them, they're telling the truth. We've all heard Trump say some horrible offensive things on Howard Stern - but he never said something like this. Tell me, if it was just ""locker room talk"" why did he never say anything **even close** to it on Howard Stern? >Pfft, all those women had corroborated stories as well.Nope. They had multiple witness that did not corroborate their stories. Why do you think Paula Jones' case was thrown out? > You have NO IDEA how true the stories are. They are 100% unsubstantiated. You believe them because you dislike Trump. period.I clearly stated that I believe them now - they, as of this moment, have the benefit of the doubt. I don't believe Clinton's accusers because of vast evidence to the contrary. Until such time comes when information becomes available that says otherwise or gives me a reason to believe they're lying, I believe victims."
dcrvp0p,,"> Tell me, if it was just ""locker room talk"" why did he never say anything even close to it on Howard Stern?This is all I'm going to respond to here because it shows how ludicrous your argument is here. This is literally your only evidence. He didn't say it on Howard Stern.It's satire.> Until such time comes when information becomes available that says otherwise or gives me a reason to believe they're lying, I believe victims.So what if most of these accusers never take him to court? You'd still believe them even though they've proved nothing, never brought this up over the course of 10+ years, and then it all suddenly vanished after the election?You give them the benefit of the doubt despite they have proved nothing? This is just so insane to me. It's like believing in God. You have no evidence besides words, yet you're all in. So question: Do you believe in God because someone said they saw/spoke to Christ? Or do you require evidence?"
dco8e5v,Classtoise,"So had Trump and that actually had substantiated proof not from Infowars.It also didn't matter to his voters, but Clinton's somehow does."
dcoha46,Groadee,"There wasn't proof lol there were women who sad ""oh yeah, Trump did that to me too"". By the way Hillary touched my little brother sexually. Why isn't that on the news either? /s"
dcocm28,,"No, it's the reverse. You can't have it both ways. Either both Clinton and Trump are rapists, making Hillary a rape enabler and victim silencer, or neither Trump nor Clinton are rapists since no accusations have been proven true.The Clinton cases had FAR more proof, testimony, and court time than any of Trump's supposed victims."
dcolt2c,Classtoise,"Actually only one of them had any merit. One woman said Clinton had a distinct mark that everyone says wasn't there. And the other kept changing her story every time she told it.And yes I can have it both ways because one of those people is the President right now. Like, at this moment."
dco8t53,babno,So literally the most powerful person in the world soliciting sexual favors from an intern a fraction of his age is further from sexual assault than girls letting a celebrity grab their pussy? That's some impressive mental gymnastics there.
dco8zu5,Classtoise,"""Letting""? The leaked audio very much makes it clear there's not a whole lot of letting involved."
dcoab4v,babno,"Did you listen to the whole audio and not just CNNs snippets? He clearly states and I quote ""And when you're a star **they let you do it.** You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy."""
dcoagjq,NovaDeez,"See? And here we are. Someone joked that idiots would imply the ""let you do it"" part of the quote would mean it's totally not rape, and now we have our idiot."

dco8578,Kilfeed_Me,Classic Republicans deflecting with whataboutism. Gotta love America.
dcoavcu,CaptainAwesome06,I remember a time when the pro-Trump crowd was asking people why they were voting for Hillary without mentioning Trump. Too bad that crowd doesn't understand irony.
dco7zl7,mmouchi,"Weird, it's almost like there has been no evidence to show he raped anybody even after years of people going after him."
dcocvb5,aaaaajk,"Weird, this is like the first time a liberals have suddenly cared about evidence . . . Quick, let's tell everyone else here that we care about proof before we criticize Trump! Warning: you might lose karma."
dcod2c1,mmouchi,"Sick generalization, bruh! You sure outed me as a filthy liberal because I want evidence before calling someone a rapist."
dco7izl,Ridry,"> Well, he got away with rape.Prove it. I **suspect** he has consent issues in his past as well, but he'd never have made the White House bragging about it... and all confirmed cheating on Hillary was consensual."
dcoaazd,aaaaajk,">Prove it.LOL, I challenge you to apply that same standard to Trump. Anything else would be hypocritical, wouldn't you agree?"
dcoaok5,Ridry,What did I say about Trump that is not provable? Or do I have to prove everything that everyone on the Earth has said about Trump? Would you do the same for Clinton?
dco7zzb,THExLASTxDON,">Prove it.Proof? Proof is not necessary on this sub. It's important to exaggerate, push a narrative, take things out of context, and make up crazy stuff. Or does that only apply to Trump bashing?"
dco82r4,Ridry,I bash Trump using Trump's own words. You're welcome to do the same for the Clintons. That's the beauty/awfulness of Trump. He openly told the country how awful he was and they all loved him anyway.
dcob4ql,THExLASTxDON,">I bash Trump using Trump's own words.Cool, unfortunately you're in the minority around here. All these crazy conspiracy and spinning of things out of context take the focus away from legitimate complaints.>You're welcome to do the same for the Clintons. Don't worry, I do."
dcobb6h,Ridry,> All these crazy conspiracy and spinning of things out of context take the focus away from legitimate complaints.We can agree on that for sure.
dco8eih,,This comment still doesn't proove anything. Just sayin!
dcoasvz,CaptainAwesome06,"If you are upset that people make up crazy things and offer no proof, maybe your rebuttal shouldn't include a lack of proof of your assertion. You know, so you aren't a hypocrite."
dco7nxq,Sadsharks,Consensual with basically a teenager who was working for him. Not exactly an equal power balance.
dco7tyf,Ridry,> Consensual with basically a teenager She was 21/22 when it started. And he was the President. It's disgusting... but the day we start saying a 21 year old cannot legally consent to sex is the day we've gone full on nuts.I'm not going to argue you if you want to say it was morally reprehensible and disgusting though. On like 6 different levels. It's still not the same as walking in on teenagers getting changed for a pageant and touching them or grabbing genitals without permission.
dcoeb4y,HDRed,"It's not known as consensual in the military when your leader does this type of thing, just saying."
dcoejna,Ridry,"Citation? I mean... I could see being disciplined over it, but is it legally rape in the sense of the lower ranking officer has no capacity to consent?"
dcoew7a,HDRed,"It's not known as rape, that wasn't what I meant to imply. What I was trying to say is the use of position/rank for sex with someone under you is a crime that you can be discharged for. With Clinton being President it isn't hard to imagine that it would be easy for any woman to deny him if he so wished."
dcoj614,Ridry,"Morally, I totally agree with you. And I'd support legislation to the effect of politicians shouldn't be allowed to sleep with people whom they are in a position of direct power over. Technically might be rough for a single President since that rules out anyone with a government job... but maybe there could be exceptions regarding being allowed with full disclosure as there is in some companies."
dco8neo,,"Well, if you are as offended by that as you seem, you must be apoplectic over Trump's history of sexual assaults. Too bad America put another rapist into office, doncha think?"
dco8pwl,BJPenwhistle,I see people insisting he's gotten away with rape but I've never seen any evidence. It just comes across like more republican smears.
dco7rga,XxAuthenticxX,There's just as much proof that Donald Trump raped that 12 year girl as there is that Bill Clinton raped anyone.
dcoxnx4,Crasz,F that... there's way MORE proof that the trumpster raped that girl than proof that Clinton ever raped anyone.Like two signed affidavits for one thing.
dco7x2i,milan777777,no there isnt
dco80j0,Lemon_Lord311,Yes there is.None.
dco82nm,milan777777,he didnt rape a 12 yeard old there is zero evidence and politics isnt a democratic sub

dcp4nqg,milan777777,im not a trump supporter lol haha

dco93ut,InvadedByMoops,">Well, he got away with rape.Source? I thought according to Trumpsters, accusations and out-of-court settlements aren't proof of guilt."
dcobma5,aaaaajk,"LOL, is this really the first time you're hearing about this? Really?According to liberals, accusations IS proof of guilt. Last time I checked, Trump wasn't convicted either."
dcoccxs,InvadedByMoops,"Oh no, I've heard about it. But you can't have it both ways, friend. If Bill Clinton is a rapist, then Donald Trump is too. If Trump is not, then Clinton is not. Which is it?"
dcoder4,aaaaajk,">But you can't have it both ways, friend.I know right? It such a simple concept that seems beyond the comprehension of many people (i.e. liberals). Are you going to join me in downvoting these kinds of articles for the blatant hypocrisy?"
dcoeh32,InvadedByMoops,"What do you mean? Trump admitted to groping women without asking, it's on tape. This article isn't about the rape accusation, it's about the tape. Good effort though!"
dcomxru,aaaaajk,Trump also denied actually doing it. So where's your proof that it actually happened? You can't have it both ways. It's a simple concept.
dco9ma9,otatop,"> Well, he got away with rape.It's incredibly easy to ""get away"" with crimes you're never charged with."
dcoxti9,Crasz,"Well, it's incredibly easy to threaten the lives of the victims so they don't come forward and then run out the clock on the statute of limitations...Oh and when they do decide to come forward have your idiotic minions threaten their lives.Yup, pretty easy alright."
dco6xb5,SurprisedSquee,"Considering he was almost impeached on his sexual conduct alone (which was adultery, but also consensual), I wouldn't say it's the same."
dco7gi9,Dwychwder,"1. He was not almost impeached. He was, in fact, impeached. 2. He was not impeached for his sexual conduct, which was consensual and lawful. He was impeached for perjury, and was not removed from office."
dco7si9,SurprisedSquee,"1. The inflection of my post was more like, ""he almost didn't need another reason to get impeached"". Sorry if that wasn't clear.2. And yes, impeachment doesn't mean removal from office, just the removal of all duties, so they might as well resign."
dco6zzg,Monkeymonkey27,Um thats blatantly false. He dudnt get in trouble for cheating on Hillary. He got in trouble for lying about it. Thats not the same thing
dco737a,Frohling13,"Yeah he lied under oath, that's why he got in trouble."
dco7ydv,Nate_W,"I mean, they made a big show about bringing him before congress to admit that he'd cheated on Hillary and when he lied they impeached him. That's not all that different than impeaching him for cheating on Hillary."
dco9q1b,RollJaysCU,Yes it is. If he hadn't lied they could not have legally impeached him because there was no crime committed.
dcoajm9,Nate_W,"Right. But calling the President before Congress to ask him to publicly flail himself for cheating on his wife, or lie, is tantamount to impeaching him for cheating on his wife.The technical reason is that he lied instead of publicly flailing himself, but the effect is that they impeached him for cheating on his wife."
dco96x0,FolkmasterFlex,Um yes it is pretty different as one is criminal and the other isn't.
dcoagib,Nate_W,"Right, but it was Congress's way of criminalizing the non-criminal. It would be like, for instance, Congress bringing Trump before them and asking him question after question about his tax returns. He has chosen not to release them. Not illegal. But now, if he says something untrue about something he had no legal obligation to release, it's illegal. I would claim that the ensuing impeachment, while technically not for not releasing his tax returns, would be for not releasing his tax returns.I'm not arguing that the technical reason they impeached him was different. I'm arguing that it's what they did in practice."
dco907c,b009152,"for the amount of hollering about Russians blackmailing trump, you'd think they'd apply the same standard to someone cheating on his wife in the oval office."
dco959j,Nate_W,"Why? Those two aren't similar situations at all. An American President being blackmailed by a foreign government is not the same as an American President cheating on his wife.I mean, you could have drawn appropriate parallels. Like, Bill Clinton being accused of sexual assault is comparable to Trump being accused of sexual assault."
dcoxxb4,Crasz,Nope. Read more about it.I thought that to until someone wrote more about it and explained that the court narrowly defined 'sexual intercourse' to the point where he had to say no to that question.
dco7hcw,km89,"Handwavey. Yes, he got in trouble for lying under oath about it. That's indisputable. But the fact that he was asked about his sexual behavior under oath in the first place, in full view of the public, without being given the chance to work things out with his wife first, is inexcusable. It's not too much of a stretch to say that he was impeached because of his sexual conduct, because it was very clear that they were looking for an excuse to impeach him at that point."
dco9s53,RollJaysCU,Why does he need to be allowed to work things out with his wife before testifying? Why should he be?
dcobrz7,km89,Because the Republicans forced him into a position where he'd be forced to admit to the whole world that he cheated before admitting it to the one person to whom that fact is relevant.That is--they knowingly forced him into a position where the temptation to lie would be overwhelming.
dcoot46,RollJaysCU,"I can agree that it probably was hasty by republicans, but it also could've been possible at the time that he could've sexually assaulted her given his power over her. Wait, so he couldn't have worked it out with hillary between the time where he knew he'd have to be on trial and when he testified? That's ridiculous. He didn't testify the moment the accusation was cast, so he could've worked it out with her. He didn't, and instead chose to try to cover it up. And so what if the temptation is overwhelming? He swore to tell the truth and lied under that oath. That's perjury. It doesn't matter how badly he was tempted to lie."
dco7q5m,Sadsharks,"What's inexcusable about that? The only inexcusable thing would be letting him get away with it. Thankfully, they didn't."
dco7vla,km89,"Inexcusable about what? Cheating on his wife?Man, if you're going to go after everyone who cheats, you have a *lot* of work ahead of you. Not to mention the fact that he *did* get away with it. He was impeached, but not removed from office."
dco839g,spilurum,"How about abuse of power, misuse of office?You think your manager/boss would get away with it if they got a blowjob from an intern in their office during working hours? HR would be up their ass with a Title IX violation so fast they wouldn't be able to finish. Why shouldn't our representatives be held to the same legal standard?"
dco8b7i,km89,">You think your manager/boss would get away with it if they got a blowjob from an intern in their office during working hours? I think that if he was on-call 24/7 all year, yeah, then I think there'd be some blurring of what ""working hours"" means. > Why shouldn't our representatives be held to the same legal standard?For one, because the issue wasn't about what *time* he was getting a blowjob. It was about him cheating on his wife, and even *more* about ""yay, an excuse to drag his name through the mud and omg, we get to impeach him too?"""
dco8nas,spilurum,"You're right, it wasn't about what time, but Lewinsky came up when Clinton was already under investigation for sexual assault against Paula Jones. Both of them lied under oath while giving testimony in that case. It wasn't just some random occurrence that Republicans took advantage of."
dcoqung,,How did an investigation into a real estate deal that occurred 20 years earlier conclude with charges about lying under oath in response to questions about consensual sex? I hope you and I are never victims of that kind of injustice. It was 100% a witchhunt against a liberal president. A sad and embarrassing episode in our congress' history.
dco7gc5,Classtoise,No he got impeached for being a Democrat and they found the thing they need to make it actually happen.Let's be totally honest and not pretend they suddenly had moral fiber.
dco82m9,mmouchi,"Newt ""I'm going to cheat on my dying wife"" Gingrich has the strongest moral fiber of anyone."
dco8tok,bucklaughlin57,How about the Repub that claimed his adultery at 60 years old was the result of youthful abondon?
dco8ska,Osuwrestler,Lying under oath is a felony
dco8xtm,Classtoise,Tell that to our next president.Actually don't it'll be more fun this way.
dco8ava,ImFiction,"Are you really that obtuse?He got impeached for lying under oath. If youre going to question ""moral fiber"", it should be his."
dco8ce2,Classtoise,No he got impeached for being a Democrat and the lying gave them the excuse to go after him. They had it out for him (and his wife). He just slipped and gave them an opening.

dcol1w5,,"So you're saying only Newt Gringich and Dennis Hastert decided Bill Clinton should be impeached?Also, what does cheating have to do with anything? You do realize he was impeached for perjury, correct?"
dcolury,Classtoise,"No, perjury was the reason he got impeached but it's not WHY they wanted to impeach him."
dcot09n,NamedomRan,They were the ones that spearheaded the charges. Try doing research next time.
dcoujes,,How is that relevant to his guilt or innocence?
dco8ouc,Syn7axError,"No, I think that would be true if he didn't lie under oath, but he did, and that's a good reason as any."

dcobsun,BigMacDaddySupreme,"Honestly I think ""let you do it"" is ambiguous. At worst it could mean they didn't stop him when he sexually assaulted him. At best it could mean they consent because you're famous. Since we can't tell for sure, we should dismiss it and stick with what we know about other things he's said and done to pass judgment. But of course because nobody accepts ambiguity, each side is going to interpret the ""let you do it"" statement in a way that conforms with their pre-existing beliefs."
dco7coh,Flakmoped,Maybe it's because English isn't my first language or I'm missing some context or whatever but how does it *not* imply consent when someone lets you do something?
dco872x,dragonnyxx,"There's a difference between wanting someone to do something and being afraid to stop them.If a woman's boss forces himself on her, she might just keep quiet and let it happen because she really needs the job and doesn't see a clear way to get out of it. That's not consent."
dco8g5g,monkeybreath,"I think the problem is that it is more likely he *thinks* they automatically give consent. He is in a position of power (owning a lot of businesses and having important connections), and often these women feel like they *can't* say no or their careers will be over."
dco7zfl,sam_jacksons_dingus,"Example: If you say ""Bob let me use his car"", then it implies that you took Bob's car without his consent. Uttering such a phrase is admitting you stole Bob's car.Source: I disagree with your politics so now your words mean what I say they mean./sIn all seriousness, there are someone's words, and there are our interpretations of someone's words. One interpretation is that Trump was talking about women being too petrified to do anything about his grabbing them, and that he could get away with this sexual assault and they wouldn't do anything about it. Another interpretation is that he is basically talking about groupies and is acting amazed that they consent to sexual activity because of one's fame and/or fortune.Both interpretations are logically consistent with his phrasing. But you will of course find his political opponents leaping to the worst possible interpretation, pretending as if this interpretation was hard fact. And you will find his supporters defending the best possible interpretation until they are blue in the face, and will only back down when a ridiculously high bar of proof has been met that he meant something else."

dco94aa,Queso_Gatame,"Nah, I'm actually pretty good at English. The expression ""let you"" could encompass situations in which someone actively consents to what you're doing as well as situations in which they simply don't stop you.

Well, he actually *does* say that you just do it:> I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. The situation he describes is one in which he approaches someone and, without hesitation or invitation, starts kissing. What kind of ""let you"" do you think is most likely to be occurring here? Certainly someone *could* respond to uninvited kissing by enthusiastically kissing back; but I'd think it's much more likely that -- whether Trump thinks of it in these terms or not -- his targets simply do not protest for fear of pissing off a rich celebrity."

Did I definitely sexual assault her?-> I run up and grab ~~my girlfriend~~ a random woman on the street from behind and start playing with her boobs. Did I definitely sexual assault her?All of those, yes. With your girlfriend you picked literally the *only* example where it's not sexual assault, because in a relationship consent to this kind of action is (usually) implied and you don't have to give it every time. How do you not see this difference? Do you think you can just grab, say, your co-workers breasts or genitals and it's *not* sexual assault?"
dco9uws,,"> All of those, yes.So coworkers students and random women on the street are unable to consent? Good to know.>With your girlfriend you picked literally the only example where it's not sexual assaultNo, I picked one of an expansive list of options. But I picked that one for a specific purpose. Because of the relationship. The relationship that exists there provides an implied consent exactly like the one Trump asserts exists, which is exactly my point. >How do you not see this difference? Do you think you can just grab, say, your co-workers breasts or genitals and it's not sexual assault?I think that's possible, yes. It's also possible that I could grab their breasts or genitals and it is sexual assault. My point is that you don't get to assert it's sexual assault just because it's not clear it isn't."

dcobf7e,kkeut,No offense but something is really off about you.
dcpd6sj,qtozrd46,">I run up and grab my girlfriend from behind and start playing with her boobs. Did I definitely sexual assault her?Probably not; but then the difference there is you have an established sexual relationship with her. Could still be sexual assault (or maybe something slightly less harsh but along those lines) if she'd previously made it clear to you that she did not want you doing that.If you grabbed a total stranger from behind and started playing with their boobs that'd definitely be sexual assault though. Just because they don't protest doesn't mean they're cool with it - they could be shocked and scared by you non-consensually grabbing them and just decide to wait it out until they can get away from you.There's a big difference between suddenly getting sexual with someone whom you already have a sexual relationship with, and getting sexual with someone you don't have a sexual relationship with. Apart from Trump's somewhat ambiguous words - which I think could go either way in terms of describing sexual assault - there's also the 13-19 women who've accused him of sexual assault or misconduct. A lot of those accusations describe Donald Trump suddenly groping or kissing someone he had no prior sexual contact with."
dcpeogk,,> If you grabbed a total stranger from behind and started playing with their boobs that'd definitely be sexual assault though. So strangers can't consent?
dcpfkev,qtozrd46,"Strangers can consent if you use your words and ask them, or if you start to establish some kind of relationship with them. If you grab someone who you've exchanged no words with, or extremely few words with (e.g. only ""hello"", or ""may I sit here""), who hasn't interacted with you past maybe acknowledging that you exist, then you have non-consensually assaulted them. You need to obtain consent **before** you grab them, you cannot assume they consent and just wait until they scream at you or push you away to indicate non-consent. Consent is opt-in, not opt-out.Do you not consider grabbing and kissing the stranger next to you on the train sexual assault?"
dcpfsqr,,"> Do you not consider grabbing and kissing the stranger next to you on the train sexual assault?That depends. If when I grab them they scream it's sexual assault, if they kiss back then it's not."
dcpfz1o,qtozrd46,">That depends. If when I grab them they scream it's sexual assault, if they kiss back then it's not.You know what would simplify this? Asking them and obtaining their consent first so that you know how they will respond to you grabbing them and kissing them, instead of taking the risk of performing an extremely upsetting action that may make them scream. That's why this idea of ""consent"" exists, to check if someone's cool with a sexual encounter before you start acting."
dcpg6r5,,"> You know what would simplify this? Asking them and obtaining their consent first so that you know how they will respond to you grabbing them and kissing them, instead of taking the risk of performing an extremely upsetting action that may make them scream. I agree, that does simplify it. So Trump is guilty of claiming he doesn't take the simple road? That's pretty god damn far from the original claim.>That's why this idea of ""consent"" exists, to check if someone's cool with a sexual encounter before you start acting.I think you're confused about what the idea of consent is. Consent doesn't exist for any purpose. The word ""consent"" exists for a purpose, the concept of consent does not. Because we didn't create it, it's just something we stumbled upon. Nobody invented consent. Consent is a term used to denote, in this case, one person allowing another person to commit an action. That could be verbal or non-verbal allowance."
dcpge5z,qtozrd46,"I understand no-one invented consent. What I mean is: that's why this idea of consent is emphasised so much, with respect to sexual assault. It's important to check if someone is OK with you penetrating them, or yes, even grabbing their breasts or their genitals before attempting to do so. Doing something like that when the recipient is not OK with it is disrespectful, dehumanizing, and will likely shatter that person's trust in others. It may make them feel afraid to use public transport, afraid to be alone with you, etc.>I agree, that does simplify it. So Trump is guilty of claiming he doesn't take the simple road? That's pretty god damn far from the original claim.You're very much down-playing the impact of sexual assault. Why be an asshole and grab someone when they most likely will be hurt by this action, when you could very very easily check if they're OK with it? Legally, grabbing someone or feeling someone up or kissing someone when you have no prior indication they'll be OK with it is a crime (sexual or indecent assault). You may not think it's very serious, but the law does, and people who've experienced it do."

I also think you're stretching the definition of sexual assault to fit your purpose."
dcphfrd,qtozrd46,">So if I just walk up and start kissing a complete stranger, and they really enjoy it, I've sexually assaulted them even though they have no issue with my action?You most likely will not get reported for sexual assault, but you've taken a huge risk. You will be lucky that they were receptive to those actions. The vast, vast, vast majority of people will not be receptive to a complete stranger kissing them in the scenario you've described. Whether it gets officially reported as a crime is a different matter. It's kind of like if you steal an expensive watch from your brother's home in order to pawn it to pay for drugs. Your brother will likely be pissed off, maybe they will easily forgive you, maybe they won't even notice and won't be bothered at all, maybe they'll try to go to the cops, maybe they won't. But you've been an asshole and taken a big risk. In my state, in my country, actions like groping a stranger with no prior indication of consent is a crime. It's called ""indecent assault"". Actions that might constitute indecent assault are: * The slightest touch / physical contact (however minimal) is sufficient to amount to an assault. This excludes touching in the course of ordinary everyday life.* The intentional touching, even over clothes, of breasts, anus, vagina or penis.* A kiss, when it has been made clear the kiss is unwanted.* Intentionally rubbing your groin against another, example; on a busy train when the other person has not given consent.Source: http://www.armstronglegal.com.au/criminal-law/offences/sexual/indecent-assault"

dcoi2m2,synapticfantastic,"The ""embassy"" you're referencing was a *consulate* -and a minor one at that; dealing with official minutia and minor administrative duties: visa's and travel details, etc. There were plenty of reasons why it wasn't really on anyone's radar and wasn't much of a consideration given the larger, more pressing issues in the area. No one -including a LOT of the people who were staffers/assigned there- had any idea that such a shitstorm would develop there, in spite of the senate investigative commission's (a wholly Republican orchestrated witch hunt/publicity stunt) attempt to convince a certain segment of the population otherwise."

dcotimg,MASTERINTERNETARGUER,"Fair enough, giving away a Purple Heart to someone outside your family seems like a strange thing to do, saying ""I always wanted one of these"" is also strange and I agree he should have politely declined it. That said, I took the comment as simply acknowledging that others have had to sacrifice quite a bit more than him. I guess people hear what they want. If you think Trump is some kind of Lex Luther supervillain then you would infer the worst intentions in that statement.

dcp0za5,,"Well, no one knows if they were or not. I mean, Kathleen Wiley accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault, only to be discredited by other other evidence which showed she was very excited and happy with the encounter, and that she sought a sexual relationship with Clinton.Bill Clinton was a real liability for Hillary this election, and that is probably one of the reasons she lost.

dcogzly,ReallySeriouslyNow,">Well they ended up coming out as liars. No, you're thinking of Bill's accusers that Trump paraded. One gave sworn testimony, twice, that Bill did not rape her.

dcomf7n,ninjapro,"It's fine to support potential victims of any crime, but if we subvert the legal system to do that, then it's unreasonable and undermines due process."
dcopimv,ReallySeriouslyNow,"I didn't say anything about subverting the legal system. They have to prove they were assaulted if they want to sue or have him prosecuted. That is as it should be. But failing to do so does not automatically make them liars and doesn't change the fact that accusations against them also require proof. Trump would have to actually *prove* defamation. Trump *and the women accusing him* are all innocent until proven guilty. That I know of, none of them have retracted their statements, or been found by a court to have defamed Donald Trump or given false testimony, or anything of the like."
dcpq6rp,,"So when politifact rates Trumps statement that 3M illegals voted as ""pants on fire"" you make the same argument, correct?"

dcojjlw,allfluffnostatic,How is it slimey? I feel America should know how the candidate feels about sexually assaulted people before they elect a president because god knows the media wasn't covering it.
dcojss5,notdez,He himself bragged about sexual assault... Do you see any irony in what you are saying?
dcok0zc,allfluffnostatic,The media had already covered the locker room talk 100x more than the actions Bill Clinton actually did and Hillary supported.
dcok7nu,notdez,And they would've done the same for Bill if they had audio proof. Do you really not see the hypocrisy in your argument?
dcokio5,allfluffnostatic,"Are you kidding? The media has been rigged against him ever since he started. Saying ""If they had more evidence, then the media would mention it"" is false as they barely mentioned a word of the DNC leaks or Hillary Clinton's Saudi Arabian buddies."
dcokxco,notdez,"Lol barely mentioned a word of the DNC leaks, is that a joke?"
dcolgkl,mellowfever2,"First, Trump wasn't running against Bill; he was running against Hillary.

How old are you? This is laughable. You have created an alternate reality for yourself.I'm going to assume that you are either under 20 or were in a coma during the late '90s. Bill Clinton was *literally* impeached over his actions. This was *the* news story of his entire second term.The Trump tape got a sliver of the coverage that Clinton's actions did."

dcoi7hw,onioning,"Libya is not a crazy conspiracy theory, but nor is Hillary Clinton the sole responsible party.

That is so absurdly implausible. I do take what he says seriously, as we all should. If we can't take him seriously, then we definitely shouldn't have him as President. That much really doesn't seem arguable."

dcocsva,djm19,I respect your willingness to cling to lies even after your candidate wins office.
dcohyfp,ReallySeriouslyNow,">almost as bad as assassinating the guy who leaked documents from the corrupt party which blatantly conspired to oust your opponent I wonder if you have any concept of how ridiculous that story is and for how many reasons. For starters, this is supposedly the story for how Wikileaks got the DNC data. Problem is, the DNC data was not a Wikileaks release. Wikileaks just rehosted it. Some angry person from the DNC didn't hand if off to a Wikileaks contact in the woods. Wikileaks literally pulled the info from another website on the internet and put it on their own. John Podesta, the person whose emails Wikileaks was the original releaser of, was not a DNC employee. His emails are not on DNC servers. An angry DNC employee does not have access to them. Seth Rich did not work in IT, had no access to DNC servers, certainly didn't have access to John Podesta's email account, and there is literally nothing indicating he was a Sanders supporter. He was planning to move to NY to work for Hillary's campaign. If he was assassinated, they did a pretty shitty job, considering they left him alive.Then there's the fact that literally nothing in the emails shows any action taken by Hillary or the DNC to ""oust"" Sanders."

Instead, his speech was mean spirited, highly insulting to Obama and the majority of Americans who didn't vote for him, and very divisive.My father said ""I'm 70 years old and I have never once felt like this at the inauguration of a president I did not vote for."" I feel the same way. This is different. George W Bush, even, was respectful to Clinton at the inauguration. He even saw him off at the helicopter.

I mean, the whole thing is ridiculous,” Trump said Tuesday during a phone interview with Fox News. “What is this, right prior to his being shot, and nobody even brings it up. They don't even talk about that. That was reported, and nobody talks about it.”>“I mean, what was he doing — what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death?

About one million were wounded in Afghanistan and Iraq, which is higher than Vietnam, which was around 300,000, but our definition of ""wounded"" may have evolved over time (i.e., we might be inclusive of more types of injuries now than in the 1970s).Also, our ability to protect soldiers from fatality has improved significantly, but that converts many deaths to injuries."

I don't remember Bush's first month in office, but it would be hard to convince me that it was worse than Trump's. It's been a bad month. I'm partly glad how bad of a month it is because presumably the stage is set for some serious opposition to Trump in the military and in the intelligence community and some critique by congressional Republicans. Of course it's worse than if Trump was reasonable and didn't have Bannon on the security council. Big picture, I'm still not going to judge Trump as worse than Bush overall. It took Bush years to launch the Iraq War, and I expect Trump will plan his war for re-election time."

dco9lz2,dariusj18,"The Bush Doctrine was a method of spreading Democracy. Destabilizing the Middle East is a requirement to what he thought would be a Democratic wave rising from the ashes. The idea is that dictators have too much power nowadays for real revolutions so if we take away their power than the natural inclination of the poeple will be towards freedom.It's a nice idea, and we saw some effects like it during the Arab spring. Some could say that after Bush set us down that path it was Obama's fault for not continuing the doctrine. That may be true, but that really only makes the doctrine weaker IMO.It is an unfortunate truth that one president can set a precedent that others must follow for years or risk even worse repercussions."
dcoa2mw,akaghi,"I suppose one could argue that overthrowing Saddam and the Taliban were noble reasons, if a gamble that didn't pay off. People talk a lot about Assad, Erdogan, the Saudis, and other authoritarian regimes as ones we should not only not support but actively overthrow. The trouble is, you don't and can't know what will replace them. It could be great, but could also give rise to ISIL/Daesh. Not everyone is ready for western democracy (or even want it) and sometimes, sad as it may be, might be better off with a shitty authoritarian dictator as their leader.Obama did it in Libya, for instance, going after Gaddafi. Bush has acknowledged that he will be judged by history and embraced it. He did what he thought he should do at the time and hasn't tried to make excuses.

He was wrong, but I think it came from his bad choices for cabinet picks. When he won his second term, and things changed from every perspective in Iraq (how we conducted the war, et al) we saw the war turn around too. If he didn't pick Cheney and Rumsfeld to his cabinet we never end up in Iraq. But in the end, those bad choices is why he is one of the worst Presidents, but there is a difference in bad cabinet picks and willfully being destructive. Trump will do so willfully."

dcoaw04,cuginhamer,"Apparently. For people who legitimately feared a McCain or Romney or Jeb-led invasion of Iran/Syria/s. Lebanon, there's a figment of an upside of Trump's bromance with Putin. It seems like that alliance ought to make Trump less likely to attack the Ayatollah and Assad (Putin's other best buddies). Not much consolation, and I won't be surprised if Trump turns on Putin and goes that route (some of his cabinet favored that path before). Trump wants to appear strong and attack some baddies, we'll just see whether that's continuing to hit the targets Obama was already blasting but making a bigger PR show out of it (we can trust Trump to gloat where Obama was silent) or picks new targets (hopefully small ones, please dear god)."

dco9853,cuginhamer,"No, I don't believe so. I'm curious for your evidence that he killed way more people, since Bush gets the blame for starting the Iraq war and most of the deaths came before Obama got into office. Furthermore, the wars that Obama got involved with (never started from scratch) were not nearly as horrible--I don't think if McCain or Romney had been elected there would have been fewer deaths. But I do think if Gore had been elected there would have been fewer deaths. As for debt, my comment above was about wasteful spending not about debt. I am concerned about debt increases and support a middle class tax increase (I am happy to pay my part). But debt fits together with a lot of different things and not all debt is a bad thing, so for me to consider a president bad, wasted money hurts more than borrowing per se."

dcoae3j,cuginhamer,"Sorry, I'm actually having trouble finding that.

dcodmac,PuddingInferno,"I don't think it's so much ""liberal purists"" as a bunch of Americans looked at an obviously unqualified con man and a vaguely shady former Senator and Secretary of State and said ""...but I just don't *like her.*"""
dcobw3a,,"I got downvoted yesterday and called racist for saying the same thing. I even pointed out that I wasn't blaming voters, I was blaming the party and the Clinton campaign. But apparently the fact that African Americans turned out in lower numbers in *all* states (not just ones with increased voter suppression) and voted for Trump in higher rates than they voted for McCain or Romney, makes *me* racist. Clearly Trump's win was solely the fault of Bernie supporters (who they assume were 100% white men). I don't blame black voters, unlike people who blame Bernie supporters. It seems obvious that the AA community will come out in greater numbers to vote for the first African American president, and won't show up in as great of numbers for the first white woman president. There's nothing wrong with that--I would expect more atheists to show up to vote for an atheist, or may gay people to vote for a gay candidate, or possibly more Latinos to vote for a Latino president (though Latinx identity is a bit more complicated). The problem wasn't lower black turnout, the problem was the Clinton campaign's assumption that the Obama coalition would show up in the same numbers as 2012, and that they couldn't possibly lose any voters to the Republicans in the last four years. So many black voters stayed home or were denied the right to vote, a bunch of white middle class people shifted hard to the right, ten percent of the Bernie people voted third party or write-in, and the Republicans fell in line.But apparently I'm racist for saying that. Like jesus, fuck the alt-reich six ways to Sunday, but I can see what they mean about overzealous use of the term racist."
dcoc9vf,EarthAllAlong,"And why can't we blame trump voters for being brain dead and easily manipulated? There were like 15 other candidates on their side. Granted some of them were other morons like Ben Carson and Carly fiorina, but there were maybe a couple that would have known what they were doing. Or, if they really wanted to stick it to elites and take back the country for the working man, there was a candidate for that... Too bad so many places make you already be a registered democrat like six months in advance, give me a break"

dcob3g0,Sptsjunkie,Also funny how moderates who berate Republicans for lack of critical thinking and voting blindly for and candidate with a R next to their name will be so critical of Dems for not doing the same.
dco7v8s,Her0_0f_time,Or maybe if the Democrats didnt push hard for Hillary and let Bernie run a fair campaign we could have had the most popular candidate in years go up against Trump. Instead we got the two worst candidates in a race to the bottom because it was her turn.
dcobow8,,"there was no evidience of vote tampering in primaries, hillary won her respective primary wins by large margins. bernies' wave was just a little too late and a llittle too short. if he'd started campaigning earlier things might have been different."
dcodpkl,Her0_0f_time,"I didnt say anything of vote tampering. I was talking about how early on the DNC worked with the mainstream media to minimize coverage of Bernie to make it seem like he wasnt a legitimate contender even though polls had them very close. This had a major impact in the early southern states as Bernie wasnt getting enough coverage. He did much better down the line when the media coverage became more balanced. Though they still covered Clinton moreOr that time Hilary had debate questions leaked to her so that she could better prepare for debates against Bernie since she needed that to look better than him. Which would make Bernie look less prepared in front of the public.Or how about the mainstream media using super delegate counts to show how much of a disadvantage Bernie has even before the first states voted. Because undecided people generally tend to cast their vote for whoever has the greater chance of winning.Similarly, just before some of the biggest states held their election the media announced that Hillary had won because of the pledged super delegates. Which would have made many Bernie supporters in the later states not show up because their vote no longer mattered, even though that was completely untrue.Or that leaked email talking about ways the DNC can try and push Bernie out to make Hilary look good even though the DNC is supposed to remain a neutral party.Finally, the biggest issue of them all, the piss poor debate schedule that was designed to keep Bernie from being shown to the public. Most of the debates were held during off hours or when another event was going on and fewer people would be watching. Not only that, but they made it so that candidates could not show up at non DNC debates if they wanted as that would bar them from participating in the main stage debates that most of the country watched. This significantly cut down on the exposure that Bernie and many of the other early candidates recieved further supporting Hillary as she had everything to gain from fewer debates seeing as she was a historically bad candidate with historically low raitings. And the only reason she isnt the lowest rated candidate in history is because of Trump.There are more legitimate reasons for why the primaries were rigged in Clinton's favor than vote tampering. If Bernie and Hillary were allowed to run with no interference and with equal coverage then the race would have been a hell of a lot closer."
dcoiac5,,So you want a more 'fair' media?how do we do that? any regulation of media would be anti-free speech.
dcoiw7v,Her0_0f_time,"Thats the only thing you got from that? Way to completely disregard all my other points about the corruption that Clinton needed to even stand a chance of winning the primary over Sanders. Or maybe you are just too good at ignoring the glaring truth just like the DNC did when it nominated their weakest candidate in decades to become the president. And surprise surprise, she failed. Dont forget I still have 5 more paragraphs of talking points there for you to see that Clinton was not a strong candidate and needed every advantage she could possibly get to even keep a close victory over Sanders."
dcoj0cr,,> corruptionIs that why she's in jail?Trump will surely lock her up any day now... But please continue your rambling.
dcok240,Her0_0f_time,"Corruption does not necessarily mean she is going to jail. Stop putting words into my mouth. No one ever said anything about jail time in this conversation until you brought it up. Stop acting like a child and avoiding the harsh truth that she was a horrible candidate to go against Trump and that she had no chance of winning against him.And dont go saying the Russians handed Trump the election. There is no proof that they did anything other than release propaganda which the media you are so fond of having free speech decided to cover. Just like Clinton did to Bernie, Trump and the Russians did to Clinton. You cannot cry foul over one and wave away the other. They are either both bad or both completely fine. There is no in between."
dcokkdo,,"Russian interference influenced the election by selectively releasing true information (though none of it illegal) for Trump to use against his opposition. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Operations_(United_States)Since, corruption isn't legally defined you get to skate along with your accusations without being liable. But none of what Hillary did was illegal just part of playing hardball and doing what it takes to win. Hillary is literally the toughest broad on the planet. You don't get through the kind of shit she wen't through and still show up to the inauguration like it's walk in the park. Bernie looked like he was wearing a Sears suit from the 80s. Stay salty."
dco9yru,CH_GOROG,"Oh, stop. I voted for Clinton, but I will be the first to voice the opinions that she was a terrible candidate and more corrupt than Nixon who sold weapons to extremist groups, made Libya a worse place, and is either a liar or dangerously incompetent.I'd easily take Bush or Obama at their worst over Hillary."
dcoay3c,TastyBrainMeats,Bush the younger over Hillary? Not in a million years. How much do you remember of the Bush presidency?
dcocff5,CH_GOROG,"All of it. Guantanomo, the Patriot act, Katrina, regulatory cuts, all of it. But in comparison to Clinton, I'd much rather get Bush again. Hillary's pay for play with foreign interests, her saber rattling with Russia, secret collusion with the DNC while feigning innocence and crying wolf against Sanders' ""unfair"" campaign, her near habitual problem with lying and 'misremembering', her support of the TPP, Benghazi where she got Americans killed and she had then lied about it, made problems worse with Libya, the e-mails where she had CONSTANTLY lied about through every stage of the process, indiscriminately supported drone attacks in which the administration she worked for hid the real number of civilians killed in these attacks (some of which justify the classification of war crimes), and thought of the Supreme Court as an extension of morality-pushing lawmakers (with dangerous precedence) rather than oversight for laws' constitutionality."
dco7jw1,mnmkdc,"I think if Bush was elected in 2016 Wed be much happier than we are now. Bush was in a worse time to be President (9/11, katrina, etc ), and he handled them poorly, in my opinion. Switch trump and bush and I think Wed be in a much worse spot today because I dont think trump is ready for disasters like Bush was. And that's saying something"
dcoa4la,CH_GOROG,"I think it's also a problem in terms of being President during the rise of 24/7 news channels staking their claims in particular political parties and ideologies, and turning to hyperbole to send its messages, which has inextricably changed political discourse."
dco7wys,MrSquicky,"Bush's upper potential, the best he could have done, was to be a mediocre president. He didn't reach that and ended up being a bad one.

dco90p8,tomdarch,"The day after the election, I tried to imagine where this might be positive. Trump is a Manhattanite so he's not rooted in a lot of the social conservatism, plus he personally has met and worked with people from all over the world. Maybe sure, he'd push tax cuts for the rich and some anti-consumer ""free market"" stuff, and that might actually stimulate the economy in the short term... Maybe he'll block the Republican social conservatives from pushing anti-gay stuff... Basically, maybe he'd position himself as neither a Republican nor a Democrat and play against both sides from the middle...But no. The White House staff and cabinet picks show that he is surrounded by people who are off the deep end of Republican politics. He hasn't made any statements during the transition that would show him to be balancing any of that. Simply the *quality* (which is to say embarrassingly low) of the cabinet picks is a problem. A guy who got a D in his college ""meat science"" class to run the Department of Energy? A Secretary of Education who literally doesn't know the difference between looking for growth vs. meeting fixed achievement goals in student testing? This stuff is absurd. On top of that, there are huge numbers of posts below the cabinet level that the incoming administration simply don't have anyone lined up to fill. Most crucial are the National Security posts that will be empty later today. Terrorists around the world are constantly trying to attack the US, and we need the best people to be continuously monitoring and countering that, but the incoming administration is fucking up that continuity. A likely part of how the 9/11/2001 attacks happened 8 months into the incoming W Bush administration is that they didn't staff up and get on top of what the previous administration was telling them about Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda group. The incoming Bush administration was forming a committee to bring major people up to speed on the threat, but the committee never met prior to September 11th. It very much looks like the Trump folks literally don't know what they are doing, and that is very scary.(There's also the fact that as badly as the Bush folks and the neo-cons abused the aftermath of 9/11/2001, Trump and his people would go much, much further beyond the Patriot Act and rounding up random Muslims. They would wildly exploit a major terrorist attack within the US for their political aims. In fact, it might be the only thing that could politically save Trump from being booted before the end of his term.)"

dco81lp,djm19,"Just below actually having someone of Trump's total incapability for the job, when America saw that tape (and they all did) and still said ""thats our guy"" I lost a lot of faith in the nation. I just cannot help but judge a father that voted that way and can still look his wife, daughter or mother in the eye and say they made the right choice. It said so much about our society and I really, really hope the media does not relent in reminding people that this is the groper in chief. EDIT: I do have to remind myself that most Americans voted against him. But that just makes me judge the states that pushed him through all the more harshly. They thought he would make America better? He as a person already made America worse by his own admission with his groping."
dco9y2c,luminousbeing9,"I'm the son of someone who bought into the cult of Trump hook line and sinker. I can't look at my dad with any measure of respect, especially since he believes Trump acts the way ""real men"" should behave.I read a blog post my dad wrote where he repeated the ""locker room talk"" defense, and that this election was decided by *Men*. (The post was from October) It goes on that ""real men"" support Trump, otherwise they're ""pussies or homosexuals."" Or had their balls removed. It was utterly disgusting, especially since I'd never heard him talk like that. I don't know when my father stopped being the man I knew growing up, or if he ever was that person. I think he got sucked in hard by the right wing echo chamber. During a lawn care job I used to work, I'd ride in trucks with guys who would play conservative talk radio for hours every day. After enough time, it started getting into my head. It was only after I changed jobs and stopped being bombarded by it that I moved away from it. It's scary how easily that shit can manipulate you after a while. Edit: changed the wording to make it clear I'm talking about my own father and his support of Trump"
dcohe6m,ZDAXOPDR,"Thank you for this post. I'm experiencing the same mix of disappointment, shame, and bewilderment with regards to my own father. It's hard to reconcile the values that I thought he had helped instilled in me with this naked display of foolishness. I can't imagine how much worse it would be to see it written out in black and white.And I too blame right-wing talk radio for much of this. Not once in my life have I seen my father discuss politics with anyone, but he's listened to that echo chamber for literally decades now. It's absolutely insidious."
dcohxan,RedS5,"I genuinely think that a lot of our parents raised us with the goal of having us be better than they were. That's a *good thing*, but the inevitable realization is that if they did a good enough job of it - you're going to find out that you have a better set of morals than they do."

dcogd2g,Animalmother172,"Hope you were honest with him and told him what you think of his words, otherwise he has no hope of changing."
dcoim25,luminousbeing9,I haven't confronted him yet. Not sure when I'll be ready to have that conversation.
dcoiuxw,thefatshoe,Your dad sounds like a fruit
dcpm2kq,meglet,"So what is your interaction with your father like now? If he's not the man you knew, what do you share? What are your feelings towards him? Forgive me if too personal; I'm truly curious, wondering what I'd do. My experience doesn't come close.My grandfather, a WW2 vet with a Purple Heart (he's 92), and I love each other very much, but we avoid all talk of politics. The one time we got into it, when I asked him to change the radio station on a road trip because it was ultraconservative and making me uncomfortable, it escalated into a SCREAMING match. But we forgave within an hour.He just recently was in hospital. I surreptitiously changed his tv from Fox News because I know he plays it all day long. I made eye contact with a nurse, and she whispered ""thank you."" Best not insult the people saving your life, PapPap. We didn't argue over that one.If I felt *betrayed* by my own *father*, unable to recognize the man who raised me, I think I might slowly distance myself, and if I had kids, definitely limit contact. Otherwise I'd explain exactly why I was upset, and hope he would step up as a father and at least show me respect and maybe even listen to my feelings. It'd be hard to hear him out, but fairs fair. Then I have more material to reason with, too.Reason works, rarely, but enough that it'd be sad not to try./rambling"
dcpr0n9,luminousbeing9,"Well, I haven't confronted him about it. My brother sat down and talked with him just before the election, figuring he would vote for Trump. The position my dad held at that time (I wasn't there for the conversation) was that he supported him as the disruptive candidate, and that he would just as likely turn on him if he didn't fulfill is promises.The thing is, just after the election he got into a rant about healthcare costs during Thanksgiving dinner. It was a pitched spiel about how Medicaid and Medicare make costs more expensive, and things would be better if they were eliminated, and he remembers the time when his father used to directly pay the doctor after a house call, etc. I don't know where he's getting his information, but it has completely infected his take on things.A few weeks later, after my brother discovered the blog and Twitter account, it was clear that the whole ""change candidate"" thing was a deflection, smokescreen. He's part of the Trump worship group. He's much more far gone than I had feared. We want to confront him about it, but don't know how to bring ourselves to do it. I think it's harder for my brother, since he's still trying to maintain a relationship with him. I've had my own falling out with him years back (different circumstances and reasons), and was taking small steps to rebuild since then. This revelation essentially undid all the good faith he'd built up.It's harder and harder to talk about neutral things. My brother noticed that it doesn't matter the situation, my dad and stepmom will bring up inflammatory stances at the most random and inopportune times. Like if a waiter offhandedly mentions taxes or something. And it gets really uncomfortable really fast. As much as we try to avoid these uncomfortable situations, eventually it's going to have to come to a head.When we're prepared, we'll confront him. It probably can't be an accusation, because he'll close off and shut down (I imagine). The hope is that if we express just how disappointed we are, it might trigger some reflection. I'm certainly prepared to distance myself from him if it comes to that, and if I eventually have kids they'll be kept away as well. I'll make that clear to him, and hopefully the prospect of being cut off from the future will get through to him. If that's not enough, then I'll know that I reached out and he made his choice."

dcog1nc,aimitis,"I grew up in BFE in the Midwest, and in my opinion I don't think things got worse. Where I lived things got worse before then when a lot of our big factories closed down which happened before Obama. The ones that had money growing up still have it, and the ones that were poor are still poor. The biggest harm I see that has come to them is their wages not keeping pace with inflation. In that sense things have gotten worse. However, I didn't consider that as being worse under Obama because I think that would have happened regardless."

After those tapes came out, she told me that she was going to vote for Clinton because ""how can I tell my daughter to respect herself and tell my son to respect women, if I vote for a man who talks like this about women?"". She still defends a lot of the things that Trump says and does, but I was happy to hear that someone actually heard what he said and that it altered their viewpoint on him."

dcp4476,djm19,"Well, yes I am judging them. Definitely. Its an innate human quality. Everyone is judgmental in their own way. Mine is at least based on the qualities of the man they voted for.

Some things aren't forgivable, and to the excited and boasting GOP, I say to them: two years goes by quickly. Four years goes by almost as quickly. Every massive ""wave"" election has been followed by a counter-election (especially mid-terms) in which checks to power are brought forth. The bigger the wave, the bigger the counter-wave. If you thought Obama's election invited a political backlash of epic proportions, you ain't seen nothing yet. He took office with an 70% approval rating; Trump has less than 40% and he hasn't even been sworn in. These numbers only ever go down.Republicans would be wise not to feel too comfortable right now."

There are more than 300 million Americans, and if ""only"" 20 million donate ""only"" $50 a year, that's a billion dollars to use to promote positive political positions and counter the crazy Trump situation.

He's clearly a terrible human being for doing it, but I'm alright with voting for terrible human beings. What I do hold against him is being stupid enough to not just brag about it, but to brag about it on mic."
dcofdb2,-LetterToTheRedditor,You truly think Bill Clinton has never bragged about his womanizing or worse? There is a difference between bragging about it and being recorded bragging about it. One is not morally better than the other.
dcoge9g,pingieking,I think Bill wasn't dumb enough to brag about it in a way that was guaranteed to get him in trouble.If you think that I consider Bill Clinton to be a morally superior man to Donald Trump then you are mistaken. Perhaps rereading my previous posts may help you.
dcoh6hf,-LetterToTheRedditor,"Ah. So I assume you must have meant he had the intelligence not to brag about it while possibly being recorded (not *just* the bragging)? Talking about it while mic'd up (even if he thought the mic was off but especially if not) was indeed rather stupid. As for getting Trump in trouble, it would not have gotten him in trouble had it not been recorded, had the recording been destroyed/lost/unreleased, or frankly if he hadn't run for president. He lived 11 consequence-less years for his remarks that day. He was stupid and his views are pretty indefensible. But even with that stupidity, his bragging had no consequences for over a decade. There was no guarantee of any price to pay for his comments."
dcok2i7,pingieking,Basically yes. The stupidity of admitting it without being forced to is what separates the two men for me.In my opinion bragging about such things is a stupid thing to do in general. I have no knowledge in terms of whether Bill Clinton has ever bragged about it but since we haven't heard anything about it I'll assume he didn't go shoot in his mouth off.The fact that Trump didn't have to deal with the consequences of his stupidity for over a decade points to a much bigger problem with society. But this is straying much too far off topic.
dcolttk,-LetterToTheRedditor,"I would be absolutely shocked if Clinton never bragged about his womanizing. Consequences are hard to come by when people are in position of power. Clinton may have been smarter, Clinton may have been luckier, but I doubt he is any less guilty of bragging about his ""conquests""."

His lack of respect for any politician but the media was eating it up. Everyday I'd walk into work and watching the TV and Trump plastered everywhere. But here we are.

dco7xuw,cuckingfomputer,"Gerrymandering by an opposing party creates for partisan districts. If you gerrymander the majority of voting districts so that people in support of your ideology have a disproportionate say in congressional and presidential elections, then gerrymandering has *very much* to do with presidential elections. I challenge you to illustrate how it doesn't."
dcod93w,,It goes based on the state popular vote. Gerrymandering literally has nothing to do with the state vote.
dcoh45o,kvaks,"No, just no. Gerrymandering is a really bad thing, but it doesn't affect Senate and Presidental elections, just Congress (and possibly some state level positions)."
dco877k,Octogenarian,"The burden of proof is on you if you make a positive assertion. The electoral college vote goes to either a) a winner-take-all state-wide election or b) a system where votes are split based on populate vote percentages, depending on the state.The districting has nothing to do with how people who show up to the polls in a given state vote."
dcochsc,foofly,> electoral college systemWasn't this invented to prevent this exact thing?
dcocy6k,Octogenarian,"Yes. Same with the delegate systems of the DNC and RNC. Of course if the electoral college had voted against Trump it would have caused an absolute shit storm. If it's never going to do anything, might as well go to a popular vote."

dcok2j0,Octogenarian,Are you joking? Al Gore?
dco7hji,b17722,How does gerrymandering come into play here? It's not like the state boundaries are remade every decade.
dco7nwm,cuckingfomputer,Gerrymandering doesn't involve state boundaries. It is involves voting districts within a state's boundaries. Representatives for your area aren't just based off of whatever county you reside in.
dco7se8,peon47,"But Electoral College votes are based on states, not districts. Gerrymandering can't cause (say) Ohio to go red because gerrymandering only happens within Ohio state borders, and their electoral college votes are decided on a state-wide vote."
dco9of9,f_d,"The real way the Electoral College resembles gerrymandering is that it gives up to 3 times the voting power to highly conservative, low-density states. Swing states are so important in part because the vastly over-powered low-density states add up to a considerable number of electoral votes before swing states come into play.Gerrymandering is used to break up or marginalize concentrations of opposing support so that even if they possess more votes, the votes are all tied up in inconsequential places. The Electoral College has the same effect and has gotten worse since the size of the House of Representatives was capped decades ago. But it hasn't been recently revised to favor Republicans like state electoral districts have been."
dcobjnq,Dennovin,"Well arguably if you gerrymander a state and take control of the legislature, you can push through some restrictive voter ID laws. But yeah, not directly."
dco83bo,RemoveTheTop,"It's the literal only use of gerrymandering. I mean, how can you not get it?"
dco810o,cuckingfomputer,"Let's say Party A gerrymanders districts in State X so that people in support of Party A have more voting power than people in support of Party B. Party A then gets more delegates and representatives than Party B does, which then influences national/presidential elections. Thus, gerrymandering impacts President elections."
dco8tl8,MartyVanB,Yeah that isnt how it works. Even if you gerrymandered an entire state it still doesnt affect how the people vote in a presidential election.
dco870x,Valkonn,Having more representatives doesn't change the outcome of the presidential election in any way. Districts don't matter in the presidential election.

Each state has more Delegates that districts, so can't be a 1:1 correlation.A few states may allow their delegates to vote proportionally, but the vast majority of them have all their delegates vote the way the state voted. And the state vote is a state-wide tally that ignores congressional or local districts."
dco8nce,b17722,No they're suppose to follow how their whole state votes...
dcod16f,JMT97,"No, it's state by state unless you are in Nebraska or Maine."
dco884n,Icecube3343,"But the state total isn't a total of districts, it's a popular vote for the whole state. So no matter how the individual districts are divided, they won't impact the state total, it's delegates, or the national election"
dco80b2,thedastardlyone,"I just wanted to help you out here.You are wrong, gerrymandering and the electoral college do not have anything to do with each other.You are welcome."

dcod9hh,,Thank you.
dcobbo8,parka19,It has effects on the districts within a state though. Leading to a grossly different outcome had there been no gerrymandering
dco7z1a,Chrisixx,You can't gerrymander nation wide elections that are decided by states.
dco7yjc,honestly-tbh,The majority of Americans didn't vote at all.
dco8myh,Osuwrestler,Were the republicans redrawing state lines?
dcob26b,InvadedByMoops,"Gerrymandering only affects house elections. The fault lies with the hubris of the Clinton campaign for assuming they had MI, PA, and WI in the bag."
dcocmiq,Saephon,"Well, actually.... given how few people voted, a majority of Americans didn't vote for the non-Trump candidate. So if we count everyone who stayed home, yeah. Most of America chose this, through action or inaction."
dcod7sh,,Or you could thank Clinton for not campaigning in the Rust Belt. **Trump took Penn.** The fuck dude? California does not count for the country. Everyone knew the game. The Electoral College was the Dems to lose; most votes were already in safe Dem states. Trump flipped em. *That's* democracy.

dco7oav,CivilDiscussions,"If by most you mean slightly more than voted for Clinton, you would be right. But that isn't the definition of most."
dco7u9u,cuckingfomputer,"Most is a superlative of many and much. When 3 million more people voted for Clinton and just didn't have their votes mean as much as 80,000 other people (for effect, that's an ratio of .8:30), I'm pretty sure ""most"" is accurate. Look up the definition of most, many, much and superlative. You will see that your assertion is grossly incorrect."
dco8j3t,CivilDiscussions,"You are really stretching your logic here. It's a big deal that Clinton lost with more votes -- but it was only 2%If you had 50 grapes, with 24 red and 26 green you wouldn't say that they were mostly green. You would say that it was roughly half and half."
dco9271,cuckingfomputer,"When you are looking at how many more votes Clinton got in the popular vote, and how many votes the popular vote actually boiled down to, it's not a stretch of logic in the least bit."
dco9hn7,CivilDiscussions,"But the thing is that 2% is a small number, a small percentage of all voters. I don't get how people can honestly say most people didn't vote for trump. Damn near half of the country voted for trump. I agree that it's crazy to win by and still not win the election. Unless you are in serious denial I don't understand how people keep saying most didn't vote for trump."
dco9mc8,cuckingfomputer,"Most eligible voters didn't vote for *anybody*. So, by the logic your going by, no one even got a slim majority of votes. If we're actually looking at the ratio of popular votes that decided the election and were actually cast, though, the gap is about the size of the Grand Canyon."
dco86d9,The_Correctionist,No. You can thank Hillary and the democrats for running a poor campaign.

But in America, someone like King could dedicate his life to making the nation better *and actually make a difference*. Russia has a shit ton of racism, but do you think that someone like King could actually improve things before he or she was killed? Probably not. That's a big difference with America, and something I am proud of. The cancer of racism is still alive and shooting black people in the back, but overall things are clearly better than they were two generations ago. We didn't need a bloody revolution. We didn't flip from one ethnic/racial group exploiting another to reversing the situation. For the most part, we just simply got better. We have a constitution that embodies a lot of ideals, and what we did was get closer to enacting those ideals.That same constitution gave us the framework to overcome social bigotry and have our government treat same-sex couples with the same respect as mixed-sex couples. Just as *Loving v Virginia* (which threw out laws against mixed-race marriages) was overdue, but in the end the right call, *Obergefell v. Hodges* was clearly overdue, but still the right thing to do, and we actually did it. That's another thing to be proud of.America is a nation with serious problems of fear, ignorance, hate and bigotry among large parts of the population. But we aren't completely controlled by that. We actually can and do overcome it. We are improving, despite setbacks. I am genuinely proud of that."

dcp4drc,IHeartFraccing,"That's one way of looking at it. The financial crisis was years in the making before Bush took over. Could easily have happened a year or 2 later under Obama's leadership. I also have different feelings than most on the conflicts in the Middle East but I know I'm in the minority and I 100% understand why people don't agree with me. My big thing right now (not that you did this, but since we're having a dialogue why not) is the ""Not My President"" and ""I hope he fails/gets embarrassed"". At this point, he IS the president of all Americans. I respect going out and campaigning or volunteering, donating, running for office etc. but to just say ""I hope he fails"" at this point is really to say ""I hope we fail"" in my opinion. Interested to see your thoughts on that."
dcp4yht,,"It's not that I want Trump to fail, it's that I'm positive he's going to fail. Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he does not have the temperament to be president. He can't stop himself from lashing out against Alec Baldwin on Twitter. How is he going to conduct himself on diplomatic visits to countries like Mexico or China? Even assuming the Russia allegations are not true, which are troubling in their own right, his naked corruption and cronyism have not been reassuring. His senior advisers are going to be his daughter and his son-in-law, both of whom have zero experience in international relations. As if that wasn't bad enough, the Trump administration appears hellbent on rolling back environmental regulations even as the rest of the world is coming to terms with how to combat climate change. Really there's too many things for me to elaborate on in one comment, but the overarching narrative of Trump's inauguration is not one of hope and optimism.

All of these fifty-something gray-haired white dudes on Facebook were fucking *middle aged* when the Iraq War was going on and they were all voting for Bush in 2004 and talking about how he was a great President. For the most part, the same hosts and pundits yelling about how anyone who disagreed with the war was an unpatriotic traitor are still on the air championing Trump now.Somehow it's widely accepted that Bush was horrible and the Iraq War was a huge mistake, even among Trumpists, yet somehow all of these pieces of human garbage that continuously empowered the Bush Administration just get a pass, as if it happened 100 years ago."

To admire those actions. But a role model, someon you want to immulste? It makes sense that that shouldBe someone you know and can get to know. Not someone who you ""know"" through marketing and PR and public perception."

dco8unq,Sasq2222,"On the other hand, up until yesterday, there were kids who had never had a white president. Kinda cool to think about. Despite what you think about Obama now, I think he'll be well thought of through the lens of history."
dco93ci,jacquedsouza,"It's real cool when the fact that he's white somehow absolves him of all of the shit he's done.And my esteem for Obama has never been higher. It's has certainly always been high when compared to Bush or Clinton, the only other Presidents in my lifetime. And my regard for him will not fade no matter how old I get."
dco9rvt,Sasq2222,"I dunno if Trump's whiteness matters so much, as it is his near zealous conviction to be an ignorant/arrogant asshole. It's insane how many people find that trait in him to be appealing, almost enduring even.I have mixed feelings on Obama, but I realize that being the president of the worlds foremost superpower isn't an easy job, and he certainly could have done much worse, especially the current political climate. I think his name will go down in history with the likes of JFK, FDR and Lincoln after enough time has passed."
dcoe4re,,I think Bush is a big part of why millennials are so liberal. 9/11 and the subsequent erosion of American values was a very formative time in for me and a lot of people I grew up with.
dcofkr3,TheMarkHasBeenMade,"I was in my first year of high school when the beginning of the Iraq war was declared.Even then, when I had just turned 13, I could tell it was a bullshit call to a bullshit march of death, destruction, and fear-mongering. Even then it was obvious that we were giving the terrorists what they wanted--trillions of dollars of our money taken away from children, families, and disabled veterans to feed a war machine rolled out by some trigger happy cowboy eager to claim victory even though all it did was make one giant mess.I remember going through high school hearing about recently graduated seniors joining the military and dying in unnamed conflicts. Tallies of the dead American soldiers kept fresh in the windows of the history and political science classes. I remember going in to high school with dreams of the Air Force which quickly gave way to avoiding a military career so I wouldn't be shipped overseas to fight in a war that still seemed like a farce, a power grab with no consideration of my future, of the futures of my peers around me.Whatever comes of these next four years, the reverberations will be felt by all, especially those we wish were too young to really understand what's going on."
dcodfhu,,Clinton was terrifying for me.
dcoikaq,Emorio,Just out of curiosity. How old were you when Bus 43 was elected? I remember being in 2nd grade and telling my mother not to vote for Bush because I didn't like the way he talked.
dcoyrdc,jacquedsouza,I was 7. I actually have zero memory of him before 9/11. It's really weird.
dcoiy8e,Zoo_Snooze,"This is where you can see the genesis of the incredibly divisive political landscape we have today.Kids are going to be taught from day one that Trump's behavior is either perfectly acceptable or unconscionable and atrocious, and that will be a part of their core values as a person. Its no wonder that we, as a nation, cannot even begin to understand each other's political beliefs."
dcorbzg,Radagar,"I was raised to be racist and somewhat religious. The first time I voted was for bush and against gay rights in our state. It wasn't long after leaving that household that my ideas changed however. The next time I voted was the polar opposite of the first. I honestly couldn't give you reasoning for the first time, because there wasn't any logical reasoning behind it.Also yes, my parents/grandparents voted for trump."
dcoyw0z,aManPerson,"i do think it's embarrassing that this guy will be in charge of the federal government, and the republicans control all branches. but here's the thing, the fed literally doesn't do everything. climate change doesn't stop happening because it's not on a government website, LGBT people aren't less human either. on the one hand, fuck them for no longer wanting to help. on the other hand WE can still work on these things and make sure LGBT people we know are fine/safe."
dco7nvs,ethertrace,"They're in all likelihood not too young to pick up on it.

dco9zt8,karadan100,In what way?Just curious.
dcoahj2,solaris79,"Sure, and thanks for your curiosity!It's an interesting conversation, because at his age, it can be a little hard to understand where his concerns are rooted, whether it's a self-formed thought, or if it's effectively parroting back a concern. In this case, I think he had seen a lot of the political ads on TV where the focus was on bullying and kids. This seemed to resonate with him, because he also saw Trump as a bully based on those ads. This, paired with being in elementary school where the students are taught that bullying is bad caused a real emotional stir in him when Trump was elected. Like, inconsolably crying when he found out.As a parent, I had a lot of takeaway lessons from this, but I also had some good conversations with him about politics, respect, control, and bullying. I don't want to completely shelter him from the world, but I also want to be sensitive to him being a victim of hyperbole & propaganda.It's a lot to take in for a child, but it's really just another day in this world. Parents are responsible for their children, and part of that responsibility is to make sure they have a good understanding of how the world works and how it's not always a shiny, happy place. Regardless, no matter what happens, I am there for him, I love him very much, and I love having him open up to me about his thoughts and concerns."
dcodkce,,"I think that's more a condemnation of the state of politics and political advertising than it is on reality. The problem is, your son wasn't reacting to reality, he was reacting to political ads (and let's be honest, those can be pretty harsh no matter WHO is running)."
dcodsvh,solaris79,"Yep, and it's my responsibility to do my best to either completely shield him from that content or expose him and provide explanation/context. It's all dependent on your personal beliefs and the child.I decided not to shield him, but I should have had more conversation with him when it happened so it didn't bother him so much. Parenting is not a perfect science, and we both learn along the way."

dco8qsz,sbhikes,A protest is not always a dangerous event. The march in my town doesn't even require a permit. We had weekly protests during the Iraq war. They were never violent.

dcocl0h,Viol33,How do you know? They don't report the peaceful and uneventful protests.
dcodf4n,ImMufasa,"Just because it can be called a ""peaceful"" protest doesn't make it child friendly."

dco7t6c,whochoosessquirtle,"Nice hyperbole. The only protesting you agree with is right-wing protests. Which rarely, if ever happen as the right wing HATES protesting of any kind and protesters. Always complaining about how other people protest. The right wing seems chock full of cowards."

dco99a0,UGoBooMBooM,"Agreed.Additionally, I'd like to point out that children react so strongly to the vibes and opinions that their parents give off, that you can actually be causing negative associations even when you have the best of intentions.For example, I have a friend that was SO upset by the Clinton loss that her kids cried (7 and 5 years old), and the next day she took them out of school because they were ""sick"". Talk about anti-intellectual, that you would allow your kids to skip out on a day of their education because you couldn't control your feelings. She also LOVED that her kids were so passionate that they cried, and doesn't even consider that they might just be sad because mommy is sad. Last little cherry on top, this woman is a clinical psychology professor. You'd think she'd know better.Discuss politics with your children, but try to remain calm and balanced or it can set them off. And certainly don't be proud when you do cause them to have extreme reactions."
dcob2q7,deltora,"I'm sorry but it's a stretch to say having a 7 and 5 year old miss a day is anti intellectual. schools don't teach shit at those ages, I doubt those are now children left behind because they missed pajama day."
dcoiate,UGoBooMBooM,"You've picked at one part of my example and missed the larger point.No, it's not anti-intellectual to miss a single day of school. The point is that it is ironic that we talk about anti-intellectualism from the right, while our side tends to have overreactions and overemotional responses that lead us to individual situations where we're doing things that are just as wrong.It's wrong to bring young children to a heated political protests, it's wrong to pull your kids out of school because your political candidate didn't win, and it's wrong to make your children cry because you're acting like the world is ending because Trump won. They can't understand that the world isn't REALLY ending. In their minds, it just might actually be, all based upon the parent's response to the situation."
dcolubz,deltora,"if we're going to talk about overreacting and letting emotions make our decisions, I'll point to the man that made a scarecrow Obama when he first one the presidency, took it on church grounds, and then set it on fire.what message do you think HIS kids got?"

dco75st,ghostfox1_gfaqs,And I imagine Republicans say the same thing. Morality is highly subjective.
dco7j4g,Bobzer,Let's just hope they're not raising their kids with their morals.
dco7ipx,,"At least I am not a fascist. If that's the moral high ground, send me to hell.In 1995, Italian novelist and philosopher Umberto Eco wrote a piece for The New York Review of Books on fascism. As part of the article, Eco listed 14 features of what he called Ur-Fascism or Eternal Fascism. He began the list with this caveat:These features cannot be organized into a system; many of them contradict each other, and are also typical of other kinds of despotism or fanaticism. But it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it.Here's an abbreviated version of Eco's list:1. The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”2. The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”3. The cult of action for action's sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”4. Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”5. Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”6. Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”7. The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”8. The humiliation by the wealth and force of their enemies. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”10. Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”12. Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”13. Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”"
dco86ql,ghostfox1_gfaqs,"I'm not disagreeing with anything here. I'm just saying morality is subjective, when we need objective facts. I don't think we should ever teach kids that (x) is always good. We should teach kids how to think, not what to think."
dco8fhc,zaccus,"Your opinion of what we should teach kids is subjective too, my man."
dco7s8z,edible_funk,Not really. It's pretty universal.
dco88e6,andinuad,"May be ""universal"" in the sense that most of the current living people agree with it. Even if that's the case it doesn't make it inherently right.Here is a good page about ethics:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative_ethics"
dcocj9b,,>Implying Trump is a facist
dco9344,NoGuide,"Parents get to make a lot of decisions for kids that shape how they think. Even if they're not going to a protest, kids hear things at home and live by certain rules. One of the theoretical benefits of an education is that you learn how to process what you know and make decisions. Everyone is influenced by their upbringing."
dcocpfl,,There is reaching your kids and then there is bringing them to a goddamn protest.
dco6jk9,bakein,Gotta brainwash them early!
dco84ky,Killdozer0000,"It's true. You should start teaching your kids empathy early so they don't end up a self-centered narcissist like the current President. One silver-lining of a Trump presidency is that there will always be a prominent example of how decent people shouldn't behave. ""Don't Do What Donny Don't Does"""
dcocl9m,,I think Don did everything right. Took no shit.
dco8x1g,bakein,"As opposed to saying your for peace and continually bombing innocent civilians and hospitals for 8 years? Plus, at these marches there are many agitators that will provoke the police which would result in tear gas and pepper spray, might as well teach the kids what it feels like to experience both. It might produce a future marine."
dco9h0x,Killdozer0000,"Well, if somehow Trump avoids bombing anyone innocent during his presidency then I guess I'll have to scrap that 'Donny Don't' lesson. In any case, I'm currently focusing more on teaching my kids not to be racist and serial sexual assaulters. I won't be giving them the 'don't bomb people' talk until they're a little older...I'd be very surprised if a protest march in Madison, WI ended up with tear gas and pepper spray, but I appreciate the concern."
dcob0kn,bakein,"Making mistakes is normal and human. Hopefully all the violent idiots are not around to ruin the march. But propping up donnie t as an antithesis to proper morals due to dubious claims that mysteriously disappear as fast as they came into being is a sham, and should not be heeded as a reason for outrage. Especially when you have people killing others over global pissing contests. Best of luck to you."
dcolt3k,Killdozer0000,Of course making mistakes is human. It's what a person does after making that mistake that's the most telling. And my judgement of Donnie is due to his actual words and actions. And don't mistake my overwhelming dislike for Trump as a sign that I agree with all the actions of our now previous president.
dcon5ck,bakein,"I agree. But 8 continual years of bombing and drone strikes cannot be written off as just a mistake. Continually increasing national debt by the trillions year after year is not a mistake. These are calculated positions that elites and the govt have enacted on purpose. I would like to rescind my brainwashing remark, it was foolish and not justifiable. I agree that some things DJT has said concerns me. His relationship with Putin and the ignoring of the annexation of Crimea worries me. However, i do not believe that he is half the boogieman every major network and aggregate minus Fox and Drudge make him out to be. If he is, he will be one of the most impeachable presidents in the history of the nation, and all the GOP elite that dislike him will rally behind that cause. So i think anyway..."

dco8l95,Elprede007,"Not that I don't support your idea, but remember that you're saying no to it. Not your kids, they're just going to an event you're taking them to, you basically said it yourself, they're too young to pick up on this stuff"

dcohe8a,Heemoglobin,Maybe your kids will learn something when you get hit in the back of the head with a rock. What idiot brings a child to a fucking riot?
dco6oqe,,"I really like the message his election sends to children overall. For years, the school system has been indoctrinating young people with leftist ideas.""be inclusive and tolerant towards everyone! all beliefs deserve equal respect, and we're *all* americans! consciously fight against the part of your brain that subconsciously statistically analyzes groups.""Trump being elected is more likely to make children ask, ""why tho."" And when they start to ask ""why"", they start to become angry when they put 2 and 2 together and realize which political parties benefit from globalism and specifically immigration."

dco8e0k,andinuad,"If they haven't chosen the behavior through rational reasoning and just learnt to do it because of mimicking and/or just because their parents says so, then yes that's either direct or indirect indoctrination.Edit: That said, indoctrination is very practical when they are young, but I believe it is important that the school gives them the tools to break it when they become teenagers."
dco8ije,DsquariusGreen,Yes that is the definition of indoctrination. I'm confused why you said that though. Are you implying that people are incapable of being tolerant through rational reasoning?
dco8n60,andinuad,"> Yes that is the definition of indoctrination. I'm confused why you said that though.Since this chain of comments is about children and you stated ""TIL learning basic respect and kindness means you've been indoctrinated."", I was arguing against your implication that children are not being indoctrinated when they learn basic respect and kindness."
dco9d3d,DsquariusGreen,"I was definitely not arguing that children are NEVER being indoctrinated when they learn that. The comment I replied to seemed to implY that children could ONLY learn these things through indoctrination. However, this is an internet thread with little room for nuance, so I can understand why you thought I meant that."
dco9hw0,andinuad,Would you agree with the belief that the grand majority of children learn it through indoctrination alone?
dcobs5c,DsquariusGreen,"Not at all. I have worked a lot with children, and the ideas of tolerance and equality seem much more natural to them. It's almost like they don't even have to learn them, you know? I would argue that intolerance, rather, is more often learned through indoctrination, whether directly or indirectly."
dcoc7jd,andinuad,"> It's almost like they don't even have to learn them, you know? Or they acquire it by mimicking their parents. You do bring up a good point: I can't be certain how they would act in a world where there was no parents or adults. It is also unethical to conduct such experiments so we may never know.That said, at best, even if it is not through indoctrination, it is certainly not through rational reasoning. Something being ""natural"" doesn't automatically make it ""right""."
dcocwtf,DsquariusGreen,"I suppose, but we aren't debating whether all natural things are right. Hopefully we are on the same page that tolerance and inclusiveness are objectively the right things for kids to be learning.I also don't think children at that age have the mental capacity to ""mimic"" their parents on such nuanced behaviors like tolerance."
dcof15k,andinuad,"> Hopefully we are on the same page that tolerance and inclusiveness are objectively the right things for kids to be learning.I disagree with the objectivity aspect: it can be subjectively be the right things for children to be learning. In my case, according to my personal subjective ideology, it is the right thing for them to learn.Mostly because it is the most pleasant for my wife and me and children cannot in my opinion in general reason sufficiently well rationally until they become at least teenagers.Likewise I think it is extremely important that in high school they learn about a vast amount of different ideologies, both political and philosophical ones so that they are able to forge their own path using rational thought."
dcofxtf,DsquariusGreen,"When I said ""right"", I wasn't talking about morality. I mean that tolerance and inclusiveness are ""skills"" in a sense that must be taught in order to function best in our society. No one wants to hire a racist, much less be friends with one.I agree completely with your last point though, although I would argue that learning about vast numbers of political and philosophical ideologies amounts to teaching tolerance and inclusiveness, at least in the eyes of some."
dcognhw,andinuad,"> I mean that tolerance and inclusiveness are ""skills"" in a sense that must be taught in order to function best in our society. No one wants to hire a racist, much less be friends with one.I think those are wrong reasons to teach someone to behave in a certain way. I would rather see that laws are introduced so that it is against the law to take consideration to the ideology of people (no matter if it is religious, political or philosophical) in a recruitment process and likewise that is is against the law to fire one for such reasons.Reason being: if you had to be racist in order to function best in a society, that would not in my eyes justify teaching someone to be racist. Edit: To be precise, I mean racism as in ""discrimination based on race or ethnicity""."

dco8e2e,,"I agree with you as a bisexual. I don't like conservative Christianity either. I'm glad pragmatism and respectability politics are less important now that we've achieved majority acceptance and legal equality in most aspects, and that we don't really have to hold our tongue and nod and politely ""debate"" when someone argues against our human rights and existence. Think of it this way-- would you agree that it's very, very hard to change someone's religious convictions when they've been passed down for generations, and when many live in echo chambers? Wouldn't you agree that it'd be a good idea to avoid importing more of that, instead of bringing hateful religious zealots into our home where they'll naturally gravitate to ethnic enclaves?"

And why would he then team up with a staunch critic of LGBT rights?
dco97nq,Doctor_Crunchwrap,"1 you said concentration camps, which is wrong and totally insensitive2 it says right in your link trump says the Supreme Court has ruled, and he won't do anything to overturn marriage equality. What are you even trying to say ?"
dco9j25,Reutermo,1. They are synonyms. They both mean the same thing.2. It also said in my link that he would appoint a Supreme Justice that would overturn the ruling.You didn't answer my question. In which way is Trump pro LGBT? How will he make their life easier?
dcoa5f6,Doctor_Crunchwrap,"Do you know anything about the Supreme Court? Marriage equality was passed with a conservative majority, replacing Scalia with another conservative keeps the vote the same. There's nothing to worry about except for the fear mongering you have bought into. Trump said when asked, trans people can use any bathroom they like when they visit his buildings. He held up the LGBT flag while campaigning, no previous president ever did that"
dcoagw9,Reutermo,"[He later backpedaled on that statement and now says that he agrees with the ban North Carolina issued](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/07/06/donald-trump-says-he-now-supports-anti-transgender-law-in-north-carolina/). This is the latest statement I can find, would love if you find if he also backpedaled on this.Also, fuck me sideways, because holding up a flag (upside down...) means nothing. He can't campaign on reducing their rights and then say anything is good because he hold up a flag at one rally.Look, I want you to be right and me wrong. I would love if Trump made a 360 and became a staunch defender for the downtrodden and the LGBT. That looks very unlikely though."

Trump is forming a key alliance against globalism with Putin.I fought for Brexit. I convinced some of my British friends on the fence to vote for it. Leave won. Nationalist parties are springing up across Europe and are doing quite well. Clinton failed to secure the millennial vote to the degree Obama did, and there's a new brand of conservatism emerging that's actually palatable to young people.

It's pretty influential when the front page of it is covered in pro-Trump posts."

It was clear as day that he is incompetent because every time he opens his mouth something stupid or unsubstantiated comes out.Trump supporters repeatedly claim he must be smart to have won while repeatedly ignoring the fact that all it takes to win is a bunch of dumb people to fall in love with you.

Furthermore, the idea that letter writing 100 years ago is any different, when it comes to the access that individuals have to their representatives, today is ridiculous. If anything, with the emphasis on raising funds for campaigns, the people have even less access today to their representatives than in the past despite the internet. Complaining about clickbait is acknowledging all people, myself included, are not free agents able to come to pure, objective, decisions that rise above the environments that we exist within.

Because we grossly underestimated him, and HRC and the Dems catastrophically misread the mood of the public.I kinda think that Trump managed to turn the election into a kind of referendum on 'political correctness', and a lot of the public has an energetic disdain for that stuff. The real politics/policies hardly mattered. I think a lot of factors 'lost Hillary the elction', but maybe the most preventable/predictable was her (and her proxies/supporters) overplaying stuff like her gender ('the first female President'/'the glass ceiling'/""I'm with her""), or Trumps 'racsim' (like it or not, exactly what constitutes 'racism' varies a lot from person to person. Repeatedly conflating opposition to illegal immigration, or concerns about Islamic terrorism, with racism just pushed many middle-ground voters -or even traditional Democrat voters- towards Trump. And made them more sympathetic towards overt, hardcore racists.)I really hope the Democrats, and Dem supporters, learn from their mistakes this time around, because just yelling ""Nazi!!"" at Trump and his supporters (ie the people we should be trying to win over; name-calling is unlikely to do that) won't go any better in 4 years time than it did in November. We need a *much, much* less divisive, demonizing approach to those issues if we want to win over middle-ground voters.[whoops, I guess that *wasn't* the ""short answer""...]"

The fact that one of them invested in a business & then introduced laws to help that business is a clue. The fact that one of them was the ""foreclosure king"" is another.

dcqa7iq,moxthebox,"No reason to doubt? You can't just state that like we're all supposed to assume. Why are you so against him proving his wealth if that's what people like you are so hooked on? According to you he has nothing to hide, so why is he the first to break this tradition?"
dcqb777,Maidstone183,"You're assuming he's not with no evidence, I assume he is with plenty. There's a difference. I don't even think it matters really. He's a successful businessman and always has. His business would have collapsed by now if he wasn't.I don't care if he does or doesn't show them. I don't get why it's so important to people. If you think tax returns are going to take him down you're delusional."
dcqbqkt,moxthebox,"I'm just saying that if he's so sensitive about them and refuses to do the one thing that would get a lot of people off his back (especially as someone who cares so much about what people think of him).... then goddamn there must be some scandalous shit in there. And people like you just cast a blind eye on that major red flag. Again, if he has nothing to hide then why not continue the tradition that would continue to help serve his ego?"
dcqbyis,Maidstone183,"Was Obama sensitive when people were asking for his birth certificate yet didn't come out with it for years? It's the same principle.Trump isn't required to show them. He can do it if he wants. I'm more inclined to think he's just interested in keeping his smaller investments secret so people don't know to boycott them. If you think a scandal anything less than him firing a nuke will get rid of him you're sad.Honestly, if that's all you want I hope he waits 7 years after reelection and discloses everything and nothing is there just to troll people who thought it would be his downfall."
dcodgo7,,>he lies when it's convienant Like any other fucking politician?
dcof9dw,Tyr_Tyr,"Actually no. He lies in easily disproven ways, and inconsistently. All politicians (all people) lie, but most do not lie and contradict themselves within minutes."
dcog2jd,deadacclaim,Also the frequency. A quick look at Politifact should really tell you everything. 2/3 of the guys statements range from half truth to flat out falsehood.

dcoavjg,,"How is it sexual assault? He literally says: women let me grab them by the pussy.It is the EXACT opposite of what sexual asault is. You could LITERALLY put that in a pamphlet to teach people not to assault women, because that's what not assaulting is: a woman letting you touch her."
dcodljk,Glasscity419,> You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. **I don't even wait**.And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything…Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.
dcoblrk,EzekielCabal,"Yeah, old fat man with enough influence to crush your career grabs you by the pussy. Do you stop him, and possibly lose your career? Lots of people would just 'let' him do it at that point. And letting someone do that out of fear for what they'd do to you is not consent.And then there's the other key part of the quote to consider: > I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait.Gee, kissing women without waiting for consent sounds a lot like sexual assault to me.Look at yourself. You're justifying a star using his power and influence to grope women. How the fuck do you justify that to yourself? You don't have to defend Trump on fucking everything just because you're a supporter.I supported Hillary. Doesn't mean I defended her on everything, not even close. That's the fundamental difference here, you're acting like cultists."
dcobx6i,,"I don't defend him on everyting. For one thing, i believe in global warning.But that doesn't strike me as sexual assault: or i am a serial rapist, and i didn't know it? Quite often, if i'm in a bar, or something, talking to a girl late at night, i will try to push my luck and go for a kiss. I never , ever asked for permission, and i honestly would find it weird to do. If she's not into it, believe me, i won't even have time to get to the lips. But very very often i read the signs right and got the kiss.If she let you, where is the problem, man? Why can't there be love? That's what i like about Trump: he's a human, he's sexual, he's a man capable of desire and love.And when i see our fractured nation, i just want us to be able to love again, because we're all brothers, not enemies. Cheers to you."
dcocdtj,EzekielCabal,"I get what you're trying to say, so I'll try to explain my point a little better.Imagine you have a daughter, and she's just started at a new company. She's got a boss who's a little too handsy. But he knows people, he's a big guy in the industry. He could ruin her entire career for her if she pisses him off by refusing him. He grabs her by the pussy. She doesn't want to ruin her entire career so she doesn't say anything.Did she give consent? Was that sexual assault or not? Was that abuse of a position of power or not?I'd love to hear your answers to those questions.And yes, I would love for the nation to be less fractured - you can see that from my comment history, but let's not forget that Trump himself ran one of the most divisive campaigns in American history, and he is one of the mean architects of the current toxic political climate.EDIT: Added missing word: 'ruin'."
dcocu83,,"First of all: thank you for being open to dialogue. We're all so trapped in our bubbles, it's hard not to demonize the other side. I entered this debate expecting to be downvoted anyway, so i might have been more abrasive than i would have been in normal time: i'm not blaming others, i'm the first to do it. So thanks for proving me wrong.I understand what you say, but i think you're projecting a bit. All we can tell from the audio is that women let him touch him. Everything else ( the frightened women, the power hungry boss, the fear) those are images you bring from other, very prevalent, narratives: cliches from movies and tv show, so vivid that they naturally come to mind as soon as we talk about seduction. But they're nowhere in what Trump says. Sure, you can imagine that it happened to some women, just as i can imagine he's only talking about young, loving fangirls who would do anything to sleep with him.You're a cool dude, dude. In the next four years of shitty divide that wait us, find solace in the fact that you're among the last that still wants to build bridges in a country that burn them! Cheers!"
dcod9ck,EzekielCabal,"I think that's fair. I'd still argue his wording implies at least an abuse of a position of power, which is still not behaviour I'd expect from the President, but I'll acknowledge that the example I gave subscribed more to a narrative than any provable action from Trump. Glad we had this discussion, have a nice day!"
dcoe3l6,GeoM56,Great discussion folks. I am impressed.
dcoe99n,EzekielCabal,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. This time both of us were reasonable and willing to admit we might have been wrong. That's normally the barrier to open political discussion. I've had a fair few decent discussions with Trump supporters. Hell, I got my first and only reddit gold for a discussion with one about measures taken against Global Warming by the rest of the world."
dcoc9w4,capturedgooner,"lol mate what the hell are you even saying? Think about it from the woman's perspective. Donald fucking trump grabs you by the genitals in an elevator. What the fuck are you going to do? Are you familiar with Bill Cosby? He raped women for years, and guess what, not a single one said anything at the time, because they knew the risks facing them if they did."
dcodqh8,moxthebox,You'd never ever say that if you were sexually assaulted by someone in a power position compared to you. Horrible.
dcofag4,Tyr_Tyr,There are many women who came forward and explained how he sexually assaulted them.

It's not like those were isolated incidents and because we got through those we can get through this. This is a logical progression of anti-working class, pro arms industry, neoliberal policy that has been eroding our democratic institutions since the communist witch hunts.

For tax dodging:-Every presidential candidate in the last 3 decades has made his tax returns public, while he, also for no apparebt reason, decided he would not do it, even after multiple declarations where he said he would disclose his tax returns. (And no, the ""I am being audited"" is not a valid reason) For the russian conspiracy: -Even Trump himself has admitted that the hacking was most likely made by the Russians after being briefed by the inteligence agencies.

A lot of people are under the false premise that reality does not exist and there is no such thing as truth as long as you deny it. After all, who defines truth?Truth in this case, I would say, is what the written law would say in this context. Sexual assault it is. Period. There's nothing left here to talk about.

dcogovc,DANCEwhiteyDANCE,"Yeah I believe using skin color as any kind of reason or motivation for anything only promotes the ideology that there is a difference between otherwise equal Americans. I believe Obama openly and unapologeticly used this to his advatange. Example, he did not condemn the black lives matter movement, even after performing act after act of racist violence, and disrupting peaceful Americans. At the same time, he would speak out against a white police officer. Where is he when there are more blacks being murdered in his hometown (Chicago) than anywhere else in the USA? He did not stand stand for equality, he stood for himself. He used his skin color to establish his personal agenda, and allowed us to be divided in the process."

dcocu7g,DANCEwhiteyDANCE,"That's right, I don't like it. Many of my friends and their family members are now without health insurance because their rates rose too high.

He should not be president.But historical context is important. Trump will not be the first US president to have allegations of sexual violence against him. More recently, Bill Clinton had multiple allegations of sexual violence against him. Discussing sex and sexual violence openly is a relatively new phenomena in politics. The Kennedy presidency is the first presidency where we started to publicly acknowledge presidents do have sex with people who aren't their wives which means that we frequently forget and don't discuss the acts of sexual violence that predate Kennedy. Further, we don't even discuss Kennedy's sexual history which involves getting 18 year olds drunk and coercing them into sex."
dco68zg,OldTrafford25,"Didn't Bill Clinton's sex scandals surface once he'd already become president? Everyone knew about Trump's assault and rape allegations before voting for him.

Trump admitted to (at the VERY LEAST) wildly inappropriate sexual behavior and bragged about it on video, on national television. And bragged about other instances of sexual impropriety on Howard Stern's show multiple times.With Bill, it was a matter of judgment and bias whether or not you believed the accusations against him (before his election).

dcoebxl,godwings101,"No, no it's not."
dco8rcu,brianhaggis,"Did you even read what I wrote? There was no ""testimony"" from any accusers before Clinton was elected (in 1993). Juanita Broaddrick first spoke up in 1999. Kathleen Wiley came forward in 1998. Paula Jones was the first, but even she didn't go public with her accusations until 1994, AFTER Clinton took office. My point was that the people voting for Clinton didn't do so after hearing him say multiple times that he'd forced himself on women and/or acted sexually inappropriate.Oh yeah - and when that stuff DID come to light, the House impeached Clinton. I assume they'll do the same this time, right?_______________Edit: Just to be clear, I think it's very likely that Clinton DID do things that would constitute sexual assault, and I don't think he should be given a pass on that either. But if the Billy Bush tape had come out in 1993 and it was Clinton saying the things Trump said, he would never have been elected."
dcoa59v,apackofmonkeys,"My point is that Clinton still won an election after he was specifically accused of sexual assault, and it was brought into a court of law (where he settled, rather than risk having a judgement against him). You seem fixated on before his first election only, as if his second election doesn't count, and anyone who voted for him the second time is somehow magically absolved of their vote simply because it was the second time.The simple fact is that Paula Jones went to court before a Clinton election, Clinton still won the election, and her testimony does not deserve to be called an ""anecdote"".If we're lucky, hopefully any victims of Trump will come forward to testify in court and the outcome of his second election will be different than Clinton's."

dco9lsd,rileymanrr,> The goal is ensuring that the president's office is held to only the highest reasonable standard Does that include evidence of wrongdoing or just continuous allegations thereof?
dcob09s,bontesla,"First, allegations *are* evidence of wrongdoing. Second, the more allegations from multiple sources that arise, the more credible or weighted the narrative becomes. That doesn't mean it's the truth, it just means there's more weight."

If you want to use a different word then it will have a different meaning. Saying allegations are evidence invokes the definition of evidence:>the available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid.An allegation is only evidence if you believe it.

dcobkbz,bontesla,"> This is the definition of allegation: >a claim or assertion that someone has done something illegal or wrong, typically one made without proof.I prefer [this definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/allegation): a positive assertion especially of misconduct"
dcomhki,PacmanZ3ro,"But ""a positive assertion"" does not mean an assertion with evidence, it means an assertion of a positive nature, IE you *have done* something as opposed to a negative assertion which would be you *have not done* something. Allegations are accusations and have exactly 0 bearing on whether or not something has any factual basis. Given all the sexual assault allegations have been dismissed and a few ended up being demonstrably false, (or at least so devoid of evidence that they're not worth considering) I don't think this line of argument is worth pursuing."

But his sex life, while mentioned, wasn't a topic of regular discussion as was pretty standard when it comes to sex and rape."

dcoja8z,bontesla,"Journalists report on the US backed manmade famine in Yemen and the tsunami of antibiotic resistant infections poised to hit but we don't *openly discuss* these news reports. You seem intelligent and I'm sure you have a close circle who is well informed and *you* might discuss these things amongst them but are you really going to make the case that just because it's in a press report, the public openly discusses it?"
dcojlcf,Mouthtuom,"This discussion just entered weird territory because the public absolutely discusses all those things. By definition the press is the public discussion. What happens between two people is a private discussion, or a public discussion, depending on where the people are talking and how many people are around. Are you seriously making the argument that a press report isn't ""public discussion""?"
dcoieuh,Mouthtuom,"Here is a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_political_sex_scandals_in_the_United_States#1776.E2.80.931899) of early sex scandals in American politics. It goes back to basically the beginning. I'm not trying to be argumentative, honestly I had no idea it was so openly discussed until I looked into it based on your comment."
dcoj16z,bontesla,"Here's my original comment with added emphasis. > Discussing sex and sexual violence openly **is a relatively new phenomena in politics**. The Kennedy presidency is the first presidency where **we started to publicly acknowledge** presidents do have sex with people who aren't their wives which means that we frequently forget and don't discuss the acts of sexual violence that **predate Kennedy**. I already acknowledge sex scandals and sexual violence were discussed prior to Kennedy (I used the phrase ""predate Kennedy""). What they weren't was *openly* discussed. There's a difference between discussing in hushed tones behind closed doors in a room with adults and discussing sex and sexual violence openly in public spaces. There's a reason why Jefferson was able to make the public record reflect his denial."

dco8n5c,bontesla,"> Being accused doesn't mean you're guiltyWe're not talking about sending him to prison. We're talking about keeping the POTUS free of allegations of rape and sexual assault. Guilt is needed for prison. It's not needed to hold our presidents to a higher standard.> hence why nothing was ever made of these accusations,That's not how sexual allegations work. Nothing routinely happens against a lot of rapists. The more powerful you are, the less likely you'll have to answer for it."
dco97kx,rsyay,"I'm pretty sure if there was an inch of evidence then Donald Trump wouldn't be president right now, nothing but fake accusations."

And do you think Trump's new policies on taxes will help you?4. What social policies are you looking forward to?5. How do you feel about Trump's cabinet?6. What do you think about the proposed trade tariffs? 7. How do you feel about Mexico's involvement with the new supposed proposed border?8.

Do you feel that the strong national resistance will have any effect on his presidency?11. How do you feel about his twitter account?12. What do you feel will happen soonest as far as presidential goals?13. What are your thoughts on the Russian Scandal rumors?14. What is the feature you most admire about Trump?15.

dco9fmz,Glasscity419,And yet trump won the presidency while losing the popular vote by the largest margin in history. His electoral vote victory is equally pathetic ranking 47th out of 49.
dcoa869,SmokeWordsEveryDay,"Okay. Good thing that's not how we pick then, huh?"
dcodsqt,Glasscity419,"Don't pretend he has any kind of mandate. The American people didn't choose him, the system did. I wonder how much you would defend the electoral college if Trump got 3 million more votes but Clinton became president?"
dcomgch,Saculris,He has the same mandate that literally every president has had. Crying about popular vote is just petty when it's never been a factor before and when neither candidate campaigned for it. It's like getting checkmated in chess and complaining that you should win because you have more pieces on the board.We're called the United States for a reason.
dcomueo,Glasscity419,"You should learn more about the United States then. You don't seem to understand how it was set up. The house of Representatives is supposed to represent the population proportionately but they have failed to expand it the last hundred years. If they were true to the design, a Wyoming vote wouldn't equal 3 California votes. You are defending what you don't understand. Read up sometime. Interesting stuff. (You won't though)"
dcoeas2,SmokeWordsEveryDay,The system of the American people chose him. Get over it.
dcoef1d,Glasscity419,The American people chose Clinton at 22%. 19% voted for Trump. Even Trump's electoral victory is sad ranking near the bottom at 47th out of 49. He lost the popular vote by the largest margin in history. Get over it.
dcof4p7,SmokeWordsEveryDay,"And today he is President. You sound pretty bitter. Besides, your numbers are wrong so even your indignance is baseless."

dcovbnb,Glasscity419,Haha nope. Only person proclaiming someone else's victory as their own is you kiddo.
dcobjpl,uptotwentycharacters,"More voters voted for Hillary though. And I suspect that the ratio of Hillary vs Trump supporters is even greater than the popular vote indicates, since Hillary was the favorite and Trump was the underdog, it's likely Trump supporters actually felt more need to go out and vote. Though the atrocious voter turnout in this country is a problem either way."
dcobomh,SmokeWordsEveryDay,"Hypotheticals can always go in support of your position. Reality is better to go off of. The reality is nobody won more than 50%, plus that's not even how the game is played. Which makes Hillary's vote total less than irrelevant."
dcoc158,uptotwentycharacters,"Hillary still won more popular votes than Trump did, by a historically significant margin. While that means nothing as far as who actually *becomes* president, it does indicate that Hillary is more supported by the American people than Trump is."
dcoc3wz,SmokeWordsEveryDay,It means that more people who voted voted for Hillary. That's it. That's all it means.
dcoce41,uptotwentycharacters,"And until we have solid evidence that the voting population is NOT a representative sample of the overall population, it is reasonable to assume that it is approximately representative."
dcoeemk,SmokeWordsEveryDay,And therefore rejected both candidates while one became president. Hear hear.
dcog82o,uptotwentycharacters,"No, if they rejected BOTH candidates they would have voted for Stein or Johnson, or not voted at all, or voted Bernie or Harambe as a write-in. By voting for Hillary, they're saying that they would rather have Hillary than Trump; by voting for Trump, they're saying that they would rather have Trump than Hillary."
dcogah7,SmokeWordsEveryDay,"And by neither one receiving over 50%, they were both rejected by a majority of voters. Get it?"
dcogh0d,uptotwentycharacters,"Even if we're following that logic, going by a true majority rather than a plurality, the fact remains that more voters rejected Trump than rejected Hillary."
dcoh2kw,SmokeWordsEveryDay,Yup. And the most rejected both and one became president. Took you a while.
dcoh7d9,uptotwentycharacters,"So *if* we were a true democracy, who should have become president? No one?"

dcogi0c,,Oh dear! I am so shocked!Anything goes it not? So why do you have a problem with Mr Trump's sexuality?

dcour91,,Who is him? A Democrat?
dcow4ih,OMGWTFBBQUE,>Mr. TrumpRead your own comment before asking a pointless question.
dcov915,,"No, they consented. That is the point. And anything goes, absolutely anything, as long as it is between consenting adults. No-one can judge anyone for character anymore based on sexual behaviour. There is no bad sexual behaviour left, and no-one can be blamed for bad behaviour anymore, as long as it is consented. OK OK, high profile Democrats and Leftists do not need consent, as many example have shown."
dcow5yl,OMGWTFBBQUE,That is almost incoherent.
dcobxlr,TORFdot0,"Hillary thought she was breaking the glass ceiling and proving to little children that they can do anything. But actually Trump was the one who proved anybody can president.

dcoa167,pbrunts,You're probably seeing the other side of what most in favor of President Obama saw for the past eight years. Fox (Entertainment) News Net would blow everything done during the Obama Administration way out of proportion. Remember?Except now these media sites have valid points and concerns and are granting these issues an appropriate amount of publication.
dcom2km,Dinkir9,The only reason that this time they have valid points is because they're supporting your world view.

Nobody interfered with the actual electoral process.
dcof6g0,Damen_aka_Ron_Ron,"Love how you think that what the FBI and Wikileaks did is okay because they didn't outright hack into the voting system and give Trump votes. Both the FBI and Wikileaks spent months poisoning voters with nonsense, especially FBI deciding to open a investigation days before the election which turned out to be nothing."
dcopq7w,TheOriginalSkeeze,"The FBI had an investigation that they reopened due to new info it's not like it came out of the blue. But to your major point I think people have a responsibility to educate themselves on the issues and vote accordingly. We can't just silence people you don't agree with,that's the basis of free speech in this country. We don't silence controversial speech, we fight it with more speech. So yeah unless somebody is interfering with the votes then it's just a battle of rhetoric and ideas."
dcoi8mw,Yarthkins,"So actual journalism and a legitimate criminal investigation interfered with the election, is that what you're saying?"
dcoil59,Damen_aka_Ron_Ron,"If you think Wikileaks was actual journalism then I have a bridge to sell you in the North Pole. Wikileaks was obviously conspiring against Clinton and only releasing information on Clinton but sitting on information concerning Trump because they deemed it ""not important"", yet apparently recipes that John Podesta talked about were vital information we needed to know.I know it's hard for Trump supporters tocall out BS when it fits the narrative, but WL actions in this election was clearly biased. Now whether WL's actions were the orders of Russia to weaken USA, is something else entirely."
dcol83m,Yarthkins,"He's said that the information he was sitting on was already made public by other means. The unimportant shit like podesta's recipes were just part of bulk email dumps, which contained lots of important information. The podesta emails were news worthy, they contained information that wasn't public at the time, and they are verified by Google's cache, so what part of that isn't journalism?"
dcolyxg,Damen_aka_Ron_Ron,">He's said that the information he was sitting on was already made public by other means.And we have no way of knowing whether that's true considering nobody from WL is releasing any of WL's emails. Really ironic how Trump supproters/WL supporters eat up whatever WL say without the hint of skpeticism, but anything from the ""Left"" media is fake news.>so what part of that isn't journalism?Talking about WL's entire behavior and actions during the election, not a singular moment. Go read through the WLs AMA where people grill them on about how they handled releasing information and what got released."
dconmm8,Yarthkins,">Go read through the WLs AMAWhy? Assange hardly even addressed these accusations.. Do you want me to take the accusations themselves as proof of something? They can choose to withhold any information they want to for any reason they see fit, and it doesn't effect whether or not their leaks are genuine or not.>ironic how Trump supproters/WL supporters eat up whatever WL say without the hint of skpeticismShould we be skeptical of the Google verified content they release?I actually do think that wikileaks was biased this election, probably because it is expected that HRC would have continued the Obama administration's prosecution of whistleblowers which effects wikileaks' ability to operate. Every news outlet was blatantly biased this election, so why are people only calling for Assange's head?"
dcopoi9,Damen_aka_Ron_Ron,"> probably because it is expected that HRC would have continued the Obama administration's prosecution of whistleblowers which effects wikileaks' ability to operate.So we forgetting bout Trump saying Snowden is a traitor and implying he should be executed? Let's not act like Trump all for whistleblowers.>Every news outlet was blatantly biased this election, so why are people only calling for Assange's head?Same reason Trump supporters bitch about /r/politics. WL is suppose to be neutral and not take any sides when it comes to politics, yet they went showed all throughout this election which candidate they favored."
dcos5gd,Yarthkins,"It's pretty naive for anyone to believe they wouldn't take sides considering the neolibs' war on whistleblowers. The organization basically exists to protect whistleblowers and give them a voice. Also, all news outlets should be bias free, but none of them are.. not a single one I can think of."
dcoa6o8,isrly_eder,"cause those pollsters (formerly delivering wrong election predictions, biasing the polls for their own political ends) are so reliable! the media truly proved itself to be unbiased and neutral during the campaign, they would *neeever* seek to mislead the american public by choosing poor samples that reflected badly on Trump, right!"
dcoac62,jonesyjonesy,Oh right! All polls are wrong now. I forgot.
dco9uif,instanteggrolls,"That's because this isn't about ""a republican"". Pick almost any of the other republican candidates as the winner and you would not be seeing a reaction this strong."
dcofbnn,zaphod_beeble_bro,"for the love of god don't tell me you actually like trump and think he's competent, i thought us Canadians were better then that. Hell we booted Harper for a lot less then Trump has done this week alone."
dcocrlf,instantrobotwar,"I don't give a fuck that he's a republican. It's not daily trump trashing. It's ""trump has done or announced that he will do something shitty today."" Seriously. I give a fuck about the things he and his administration are doing and are aiming to do, things like:- pretending climate change doesn't exist and keep pushing coal/oil when the people want renewables and clean energy and clean air/water and to start curb climate change now. Choosing oil barons and his own pockets over the american people and the long-term future of our kids and planet. - defunding nasa's climate research- deregulation is fucking scary, especially when it's concerning environmental laws- 'opening up' federal land for resources (logging, drilling, fracking, etc)- defunding pp (birth control lessens the amount of abortions) but also making abortions illegal?- having a labor sec that shits on worker's rights- having a sec ed that wants to severely defund public schools and wants to use the US school system to make the US into ""God's kingdom""...- having a very anti-lgbt guy as VP, 'policy-maker'- having a bunch of cabinet appointees who literally have not the first idea of their jobs, but are put in for being 'loyal' or donating a shitton of money, especially since trump's campaign was to 'drain the swamp'. - legitimizing bullying, rape culture, and generally being a dick as a tactic- privatizing our national parks. ""yosemite, brought to you by coke""Fuck and I can list a bunch more but I have to get back to work."
dcoa13f,plasmagrenade11,It very well may turn out to be the end of the world. People who are acting like this is no big deal are fucking delusional

dcog935,SaladTim,"I like how you say it's not the end of the world. That can apply to a lot of things, and I'm not saying it's likely, but when the president of the united states is the topic, it could be."
dcoom84,ranchojasper,"You obviously have no idea what Trump actually stands for then. He's not a Republican. He's a fascist. Democrats aren't upset that our candidate lost. We are upset that millions of Americans have actually been duped into believing an elite coastal billionaire born with a silver spoon in his mouth is actually going to attempt to fix the system that made him a billionaire. We are upset that a man who wants to take our autonomy away when it comes to our medical decisions has been elected.We are upset that a man who wants to literally remove American citizens from their homes because of their religious beliefs has been elected.We are upset that millions of our gay brothers and sisters will have their marriage rights repealed.We are upset that our country has taken an enormous, disgustingly regressive step backwards.So you can take your total ignorance about what's going on and shove it, Canada.

dcocy5f,instantrobotwar,"> you don't always get what you want.Ah yes, things like clean air and water, renewable energy, a healthy environment, worker's rights, affordable health care, affordable birth control, assurance of equality, assurance of our first, fourth and ninth amendment rights..."

They've already taken away climate change mentions from the whitehouse website.

dcopr4h,I_like_code,Actually there will be a replacement to the ACA it's what they said. Healthcare with ACA wasn't that affordable if you were middle class anyway. I know from personal experience. The climate change thing suck. But you can't win them all I guess. Not sure what I could have done to prevent Donald if I wanted to. He is the President. Wining won't make that change.

dcpbzlk,BlacknOrangeZ,"I don't need to worry about the what ifs. America voted not to sell itself out to the lies of globalism, corporatism, corruption, multiculturalism, etc. Be glad for this reality.If leftists weren't so outrageously hypocritical, violent, emotional, hysterical, illogical, irrational, immature and authoritarian then I could respect their difference of opinion. If they presented valid arguments rather than crying over their made-up identity politics and parroting mindless slander, then I would be glad to debate with them.

dcocw6w,,"That's not what he means. Less than half the country even voted, and a slim majority of those that did vote voted for Hillary. So it stands to reason half the country (probably rightly) doesn't give a shit who's running the country, with less than a quarter wanting hillary or trump.And let's not forget that Hillarys narrow margin of popular vote victory isn't really the resounding bastion of support hardcore Hillary supporters think it is. Plenty of people like myself live in states where our vote doesn't matter, so just voted her in based off the knowledge we won't make a difference either way."
dcodie3,treeharp2,"And plenty of people in those states which are predetermined didn't vote either way. One anecdote about yourself doesn't negate a 3 million vote difference, and a 2.1% difference is not a narrow margin.

dcogcyf,philosarapter,"What a weird way to state the statistics though. Saying ""only 20% of people voted against him"", leads one to believe that the other 80% voted FOR him.

dconv9p,ColinOnReddit,"> high standardsI think they're just too short sighted to see the future. We're loosing Obama Care because a lot of dems know its shit right now. Obama got it passed with tons of caveats that he obviously didn't like, but he also know that if Democrats held the presidency for 12 or 16 years, we could have expansive healthcare reform. If every Obama voter understood that the Democrats would build on Obamacare and knew that was his plan, that single issue alone would've gotten their voter base active. They lost 20 million votes from Obama's 1st term. Republicans lost 10 million votes from Romney. The Democrats have the numbers but just can't electrify their base."
dco8a61,Banshee90,"Well its hard to get a good viewpoint, she was super secretive. Her failure was addressing the public. Think back to august when people start noticing her showing illness and weakness (coughing, being helped out of cars, using the hand rail like it was a crutch, etc, etc) she chose to ignore those critiques then in September she collapses during a 911 memorial. Now who is america going to believe the woman who appears to be severely ill who has brushed off any critique of illness or the critiques who appear to be proven correct in questioning her health."

It is possible that I have the wrong definition for that particular colloquialism though. Anyhoo, when I say that Trump wears it on his sleeve I don't mean he came out and had a press conference to say that he was a misogynist, but that he constantly rates women on a number scale and lots more stuff just like that.

dcoale6,Shit___Taco,"What, when he says ""they let you do it"". Or the fact that he never actually did the actions he was speaking about. In this same conversation he even said ""she shut me down"" and that he accepted it and never went on to commit any actual sexual assault? I should stop having sex with my wife, because according to this rationale, even though she likes it and let's me do it, I sexual assault her multiple times a week.Then in the same form, even though Bill Clinton used his fame and power to actually have consensual sexual relations with women because they let him do it, all Deemocrats agree it is not sexual assault? This seems a bit hypocritical to me. We have an action that actually occurred, and it is agreed not to be sexual assault. Then we have the same action that did not actually occur, but you all agree Trump is guilty of actual sexual assault, because...well...""le Drumpf"". What he said was disgusting and terrible, but he didn't actually commit any sexual assault. If he is found guilty of sexual assault, then we can say he is a sexual predator who ""bragged about sexual assault"", but in the USA you are considered innocent until proven guilty. So Trump is actually innocent, despite his disgusting conversation.If you consider what his hypothetical conversation was to be sexual assault, then Bill Clinton definetly committed sexual assault and Hillary was guilty of victim blaming and shaming. We have to be consistent with our definitions and facts, and if you want to say Trump is guilty of sexual assault, you have to agree that Bill Clinton is 100% guilty of sexual assault. But Bill Clinton was found to be not guilty of sexual assault by a court. If using fame and power to have consensual sex is considered sexual assualt, Trump has only committed a thought crime and yet the left still considers him guilty. However, Bill Clinton's actual actions, even though they use the same rationale that was enough to make Trump guilty, are absolved of any crime or wrong doing. Now lets talk facts. Bill Clinton was tried and found to be not guilty by a court. Trump was never tried because he never did anything, yet you are convinced he is 100% guilty. You say conservatives disregard facts, but the facts are that your claim that Trump is guilty of sexual assault is 100% bullshit.When you register as a Democrat or a Republican, do they make you sign something saying that you will throw all rationale out the window in order to defend your party?"
dco9sz8,Shit___Taco,Has he been convicted of sexual assault?
dcodme0,Huntswomen,Bragging about something that is sexual assault even without a conviction is stil bragging about sexual assault. If you are bragging that you killed your wife and you haven't been convicted you are still bragging about a murder.
dcoe6yq,Shit___Taco,"""They let you do it"" means he was implying consent. Using this same rationale, you claim I brag about murdering my wife, but I never even actually bragged about murdering my wife, therefore I am guilty of bragging about murdering my wife."
dcp3kgg,Thin-White-Duke,"Letting someone do something does not mean there was consent. Take a lot of rape cases for example, many times women don't put up a fight, because they don't want to get murdered. Many freeze up and don't say anything out of fear."

dco8mg9,Furbush,So the presumption of innonce doesnt matter if it's someone you dont like? Weird how we all heard all these stories about how he was a sexual predator until he won. It's almost as if they were lying to try and make him look bad
dcoa0j8,tehdelicatepuma,"Dude, he fucking said that he grabs women's genitals without fear of reprisal with his own fat orange lips. And as for the charges, it's already an immense risk to sue someone who's so wealthy regardless of how strong your case is. They can just throw more money at the problem while you will have most of your entire savings wrapped up in legal costs. Then on top of that, who the fuck would try to sue the president? Nobody. He got away with sexual assault because he's an affluent trust fund baby who lied his obese orange body into the white house."
dcoausc,Furbush,"Right, a billionaire saying women let him do whatever he wants to them means he is a rapist, obviously. No liberal has ever said anything in private that would sound extreme out of context, right?It's just strange how someone could sexually assault all these women and not one went to the police. Every ""victim"" just waited 20 years until the perpetrator just so happened to be running for president. It's also pretty interesting how they were willing to speak to the media but not one case ever even went to court. It's almost as if they were making up these stories to push a narrative about Trump. But that's just as prosperous, we all know the mainstream media are some of the most honest people in the world"

Next election will probably have better candidates and more people involved in politics. So as much doom saying as there is, there's probably a silver lining."
dcoceqs,ameya2693,"I think the opposite, if anything this election has shown the complete lack of apathy on part of everyone concerned and the resignation from many, many others. See what annoyed me was that nobody was actually ever talking about their policies. For Hilary, it was always about....aaah look a woman is running for power, we should vote for her etc etc, which is a bullshit argument. I saw that from some people I know and it gravely disappointed me. Same went for Trump. Nobody ever discussed their policies or agendas. Everyone talked about their personalities, their style or shit like that. And whenever policy discussion came up, it was their foreign policy because they knew they could hammer Trump on that. And that's all they did. Nobody pulled him up on how he was going to continue funding programs by cutting taxes for the rich or how he was going to repeal Obamacare whilst trying to provide healthcare for millions of citizens affected by that move. It was such an absolute shame to watch elections turn into cat fights."
dcoczw0,blarg-honk,"That much I can certainly agree on. It should be about policies not ""oh they have the same genitals as me"" or "" i like his personality"". My expectations are probably to high."

dcohyux,_Mellex_,How is it in anyway like a Free Market when Reddit admins and CEOs literally had to step in and alter the site's algorithms to suppress The Donald?
dcokd69,depthandbloom,I'll answer that question when there's a factual explanation how posts with 3-4k+ up votes have 30-60 comments.
dcokwb0,_Mellex_,"Let me know when you figure it out because this post had approximately 70 comments, was an hour old, and it shot to the stop of this subreddit. I guess we're forced to conclude that /r/politics is full of bots too."
dconb1f,BGT456,Look at rising posts at any time. Almost every single one will be the Donald posts.before the changes more than 95% of them were from that sub. Now it is usually closer to 50%. Please explain how anything but bots can do that?
dcowq96,Nanderson423,"Nope, just the_donald. You can't honestly tell me you dont think there are bots in there when there are currently 3 consecutive posts whose only function is to make a picture of Trump with their thumbnails AND they are in the correct order. The only way that gets accomplished is with bots running a script to keep them in order."
dcoj7r3,Fjordheksa,Because they brigade and use bots/scripts.
dconq7u,BPFortyEight,Evidence?And people that support Trump coming to a fucking Political subreddit to discuss politics isn't brigading. Go enjoy ETS
dcownek,Nanderson423,"He is talking about how the_donald used to post links to other subreddits to get their users to go downvote en masse.And yes, the reason algorithms were altered was because before hand if you went to /all 45 out of the top 50 would be from the_donald. No, they werent that popular. It was 95% bots. Even now, EVERY SINGLE POST has 5k+ votes. Even post with <50 comments. Just look at the the_donald right now. There are three consecutive posts whose only purpose are to create a picture of trump from their thumbnails. You think that just happened naturally?"
dcox4lm,BPFortyEight,"oh like SRD does?The Donald is that popular. At the moment there are 16k people in the sub. Politics pulls between 10 to 25k depending on current events. Is it really that unusual for a third of their posters to upvote? Consider it is a fan subreddit, that's not surprising at all.I have yet to see any ACTUAL evidence of bot usage."
dcoz6ag,Nanderson423,"Take a look at the subreddit compare to any other subreddit. Lets take /r/pics as an example. Lets look at the top 5 posts from each subreddit and compare their upvote/comment ratio (for non-stickied posts). Post # | /r/pics | /r/the_donald---|---|----1 | 14.75 | 10.022 | 15.96 | 24.773 | 31.42 | 90.884 | 5.69 | 19.35 | 6.01 | 120Average | 14.76 | 52.81 So the average upvote/commet ratio for the very large subreddit of /r/pics is ~15 while the the_donald is 52. That wasnt even getting to the posts on the_donald that have 12K upvotes and only 12 comments. You wont find a ratio like this on any other subreddit because it comes from using bots to upvote everything.Other comparisons you can make are subscribers to upvotes. the_donald has 340K compared to /r/pics 14.9 million, but the average number of votes in the_donald is significantly higher. It is very easy to see that votes are heavily inflated in the_donald from bots."

dcpigtf,Nanderson423,"Which doesnt answer how they have 3 consecutive posts whole only purpose is to have the thumbnails create a picture. That doesnt happen naturally. Especially when reddits algorithm is calculated with votes ""decaying"" over time. Last I checked they had 2 of those in the top 30 posts. The one with the most comments had ~30. The only way for those posts to stay in order is to have bots running to ensure they stay in order."

dcoistf,RagnorGreyjoy,IT does not. I've heard people say worse. I bet your own father has said worse thing he thought was in private to people.
dcoj2h9,mycatisawhore,No he hasn't. Not all men see women as objects to be fucked and discarded. You're trash if you think this is acceptable.
dcojd57,RagnorGreyjoy,"Really couldnt care less what he said years ago in a bus to some younger dude he was probably just trying to impress, probably wasnt even true, Trump is a lier right? I dont like the guy and think hes a whack job but people treating what he said in that audio like its the worst thing thesy have ever fucking heard out of a persons mouth and a reason for him not to be pres and use that as ""ohhhh he fucking hates all fucking women"" are just fucking idiots. Clinton literally had admitted to an affair and has rape allegations against him, but he is loved. Stop watching so much news and SJW posts on facebook."

dcoaurh,tomdarch,"If this was an article 4 1/2 years ago of someone making an exaggerated claim like ""Mitt Romney's 'binders full of women' comment encourages rape!!!"" then you'd have a point.But the reality is that Trump is not in the realm of the normal, where you can have differing pro/anti reasonable disagreements about his policies and personality. The simple reality is that Trump is a horrible person who has done horrible things and promotes horrible positions. He has jammed his fingers up into the crotches of unwilling women. He has simply refused to pay contractors who have done work for him. He constantly, blatantly lies. The ""unbiased, objective"" position is to oppose Trump. The ""unbiased"" thing is to condemn what he said about assaulting women, and to condemn him for having done exactly what he said he did.Equivocating or excusing or downplaying simple reality is what would be ""biased."" Clearly calling out the bad things accurately is what is ""fair"" and ""accurate"" and ""unbiased."""

I didn't vote for Obama, but when he won I said that's what the country wanted and accepted it, I didn't look.for scapegoats and I didn't try to blame the system that has served our country so well."

Popular vote.If we stayed with the way things are just because they haven't caused an apocalypse yet, we'd still be a British colony."
dcoiveu,last_callout,"Not one presidential election has been decided by popular vote, only by the EC. Also the majority of states voted for President Trump, and that's how our system is set up. It won't be changing any time soon either."
dcoixgv,Shifter25,"Except for, as I have pointed out, the times when it has changed. To make it more unequal in representation, and to take away more people's voice."
dcoj7zg,last_callout,"So the people of a state vote in the majority for that person, the state then cast it's vote by the will of the people, and that somehow depletes choice? Would you like a plurality voting method instead? Are you arguing for increased choice and the diminishing of the 2 party system? That would lend credence to a popular vote method. But once again smaller states will become marginalized in such a system."
dcojhkt,Shifter25,"> So the people of a state vote in the majority for that person, the state then cast it's vote by the will of the people, and that somehow depletes choice?When the amount of votes that state has is uneven compared to other states, yes. 1 Wyoming voter is worth 3 Californian voters.> Would you like a plurality voting method instead?Like ranked voting? Yes, that'd be awesome. That and the popular vote. As long it gives a voice to *people*, not artificial collections of people."
dcom60o,last_callout,"Then we would have to fundamentally change most of our election system and how we view the states role in larger government. So I appreciate your input and while I disagree, I compel you to lobby your representatives for the change and if that's what our country decides than I will once again abide by that."
dcpbxyi,QualityShitpostOP,"If we're gonna argue proportional representation than those big blue states like California and New York should have a shit load of more representatives and electoral votes, but the law was changed."
dcod3dy,Tibbitts,This is bullshit. Our current system exists as a way to concentrate power under two parties. If what you were saying was true CA wouldn't have more electoral votes than other states. The equalizing effect of the ec is small. Its main substantial effect is that a few swing states get all the attention.Removing the ec would make it harder for both parties. Which is why it stays. If it was removed Democrats couldn't count on the coasts being a solid blue block anymore and the Republicans couldn't count on the south being solid red. The reality is the USA is far more diverse in its politics than the ec gives voice to.
dcogj7k,last_callout,"Because CA has a higher population they get more electoral votes proportional to thier population. So they get more of a say than let's say, Maine. But they don't get enough EC votes to actually pull the whole election. So this way individual states are still important and have a say in government."
dcojhcg,Tibbitts,"The reason CA doesn't get attention is because it is solid blue. If CA became a swing state they would get more attention than FL, MI, or any other swing state. Remember too, the swing states are not small. FL has 29 electors vs maine's 4.The EC exists because some wanted popular vote for the president, others wanted the president elected by congress and feared the incompetence of the public. The compromise was the EC, as it would allow for the electors, in the cases where the public chose a popular but unqualified individual, to overrule the popular opinion.Since then we have had 2 major changes that have left us where we are now. First was states switching to winner-take-all as a way to concentrate party power.Second was the elimination of electors being free agents which eliminates the original intent of the compromise. The effect of all of this is that we focus on swing states, small states still get swept aside, and people's voices in solid blue or red states is rendered meaningless."
dcomcmz,last_callout,"That same argument could be used for TX or NY as well. I'm not saying the EC is a perfect system at all, saying that it is preferential to a popular vote system. The EC has served us well and I believe it will continue to do so, and when and if it doesn't than we as a people and our representatives will have to decide together the system that we wish to replace it."
dconhet,Tibbitts,"The reason I responded to your comment is because it is incorrect on both the history of the EC as well as the effect - not your personal preference. As to your personal preference on it, whether or not it has served us well depends upon what one believes is the intent.If the intent is to make smaller states have equal voice to larger states, the ec is a failure. If it's intent is to serve as a safety valve against the populace voting in unqualified candidates, again, it is a failure there as well. If it's intent is to polarize the country, concentrating power in the hands of two rival parties, it's a resounding success."

dcofmvv,pjc_nxnw,Trump was saying it until the day it gave him the W.
dcod6j7,Gustacho,"If the roles were reversed, I would still hate it. The electoral college doesn't reflect the will of the people, but is decided by the swing states. Candidates don't go to dark blue or dark red states, and I think that's a problem."
dcoll4w,Gezeni,"im not a fan fo the electroal system by any means. But there are issues with popular vote as well. For starters campaigning would move from swing states to major cities. LA, NYC, Houston, Chicago, Philadelphia would be the swing *cities*. Recounts would be a motherbitch to perform."
dcoi4o6,craig80,Then please link to a comment were you said it before the election.
dcoirnc,Gustacho,"My high school History class (in Belgium) had a special unit about how the American elections, the parties, the issues and the electoral college. This was in 2012, and everybody in my class, including me, hated the electoral college. We watched this video: https://youtu.be/OUS9mM8Xbbw.I searched my reddit comments, but did not find anything."
dcoj8ao,StuporMundi18,Ah so you're a maybe 20 year old from not America sounds like you sure know so much about it here. Your opinion on another country's electoral process is useless because I highly doubt you know enough about it to have an actual informed opinion on it. You took one class in high school about it that's not enough knowledge to speak as an expert on it
dcojhjr,Gustacho,I read American newspapers. I watch American television. I watch American YouTubers. I read laws in English for my law degree. How do you inform yourself?
dcokqxx,StuporMundi18,By reading American laws and the papers written by the founders who may know a thing or two about why it was set up the way it was. And just studying it throughout university.
dcoktl1,Gustacho,"We studied the American Constitution during the subject History, fyi"
dcol1w9,StuporMundi18,That's cool and all but I highly doubt you go into as much detail on it as I did in my classes that were specifically about the creation of the U.S. and the constitution.
dcol63g,Gustacho,"So how were your classes? What school did you go to? Can you teach me something about the Constitution that I don't know of, and that would change my view on the Electoral College?"
dcolifu,StuporMundi18,What do you mean by how were my classes? They were like normal college history courses where you have to read primary sources and do your own research and write papers on your research. And why does what school I went to matter? And I highly doubt it because you seem pretty set on your opinion of why it is bad. But why it's not a terrible system is that instead of winning just a majority of votes the winner has to win the majority of votes in the majority of states with America being so large land wise and population wise and with such diversity it helps keep it that the winner has a more diverse supprt group. In a just popular vote the winner would just have to appeal to the large population centers but in the current system they have to appeal to the rural areas as well to win so then their voice doesn't get drown out.
dcomcn3,Gustacho,"The biggest 100 cities in America (the 100th being San Bernardino with 216 000) together only have 20% of the population. Even if hopped between those cities alone, you wouldn't win an election. Just look at France, a country with a popular vote system. All the candidates are travelling all around the country. I looked up the last city visited by Mélenchon, Le Pen, Fillon and Macron on their social media. The cities are respectively: [Florange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florange), [Forbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbach), [Oyonnax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyonnax) and [Quimper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quimper). Not exactly the big cities, and spread out all over France."
dcon66j,StuporMundi18,France is the size of Texas in land area. One state. America is much larger than France so a tad harder to get around but the candidates still visit places with very small populations like 1000 people small because they need those votes in those states to win. In popular vote like how governors are chosen one major city can literally pick who runs the state even if the rest of the state doesn't want that. It's possible to do that in America too because what you don't really understand with your top 100 cities is that they have surrounding metro areas that pretty much are the same thing. Chicago has 3 million people in it while the metro area has 9 million people most of these cities also have areas like that. Those areas would have even more say in how the country is run than they do which is already more so than the rural areas.
dconsfn,Gustacho,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't the states red or blue depending on the popular vote? So the winner of the state gets the most votes in that state?"
dconzly,StuporMundi18,Unless there are 3 candidates but yes each state election is popular vote and so is the presidential one partially because each state votes for their electors by popular vote. The way to look at it is that there are 50 or so separate elections and they are all popular votes. One way to change it would be to separate electoral votes by percentage of votes instead of winner take all then it has both the electoral college and is more popular vote
dcoo5g4,Gustacho,"But doesn't that mean that the presidential election is just like the gubernatorial election, where the big city decides the state? The example you gave to show how bad popular vote systems are?"
dcojtzt,craig80,"By being american. I learn about our culture, our elections, and our laws just by being me everyday."

dcot8ql,,[deleted]
dcoucb7,craig80,"Trump isn't conservative and I didn't vote for him. I do however support the EC, and dind democrats hypocritical for not complaining about before the election...just...like...you."
dcokusz,StuporMundi18,No it's not affirmative action for rural whites it's there so the major population centers can't just run roughshod over the less populous areas. The less populous areas can't win elections without some population center but the populous areas could win without the rural areas especially if it was just straight popular vote.
dcolg5p,,[deleted]
dcolmqh,StuporMundi18,They literally can't do that without some of the more populous states to join in like Texas the 2nd most populous state or Florida the 4th or Ohio and so on. They can't just win with places like Wyoming and their 3 electoral votes. California has 55 of them that's still the most by a long shot. It is literally impossible for just the rural areas to do that.
dcokegi,Gustacho,"These Americans hate it:https://youtu.be/W9H3gvnN468https://youtu.be/OUS9mM8Xbbwhttps://youtu.be/90RajY2nrgkThey are Americans, they too know about their culture, elections and laws by just being themselves everyday, and yet they hate it!"
dcol03l,StuporMundi18,And then there's the majority of Americans who still like it
dcol2go,Gustacho,Source?
dcopz14,craig80,The lack of any real political capital to have it changed. Having it changed has never been an issue prior to an election.
dcotgaq,Gustacho,"That's because the electoral college, combined with the winner takes it all system, maintains the two party system. Don't expect change from Democrats or Republicans. The change has to come from an independant movement, which is nearly impossible."
dcol9al,Irctoaun,"But every trump supporter who suddenly became the electoral college's biggest fan after the election is an expert in electoral systems? Being part of a system doesn't make you an expert in it. In fact, I'd argue in this case, having an outside view of the electoral college means you can evaluate it more fairly since you can look at it for what it actually is, rather than being caught up in it and and seeing certain bits"
dcolq2z,StuporMundi18,Well then you are wrong because being from another country means that you can't understand how large and diverse America is which is one of the reasons it exists in the first place still. Because now you have to win the majority of votes in the majority of states instead of just the population centers
dcomf41,Irctoaun,">Well then you are wrong because being from another country means that you can't understand how large and diverse America isThat's just not true. Not even close. That's like saying if you're not from france you can't speak French >Because now you have to win the majority of votes in the majority of states instead of just the population centers Now you've just proved my point that being part of the system doesn't make you an expert in it. You could win the minority of the votes (you don't need a majority to win a state) in a minority of states and still get a landslide victory overall. For example, you could win the election by winning only the 11 biggest states and you wouldn't need a majority in any of them"
dcomryh,StuporMundi18,That isn't similar at all. Knowing a language isn't the same as knowing a culture and country throughout. I know German but wouldn't say I'm a German culture expert just like they may have studied U.S. government classes but without living here you truly can't understand how large and diverse America is. And if there was a candidate who could win all 11 of the largest states they easily would win the majority of the rest because if Texas and California agree on a candidate they have to be pretty damn popular.
dcontzw,Irctoaun,"Perhaps this is a lack of empathy thing. Just because you can't understand something you're not part of, it doesn't mean other people also can't. Yes, in reality that scenario is improbable but you're missing the point. Despite apparently being an expert in the American political system by living there, you've demonstrated you don't really know how it works. That was simply an example of where your explanation is obviously wrong. If you want a more realistic example of the system not working, look at the votes in Marland vs Wisconsin. Both are worth 10 points but in Marland, Clinton won with way more votes than Trump did is wisconsin but they both got the same number of points for it."
dcoob1i,StuporMundi18,No I do know how it works and you clearly don't understand what I'm saying if you think that. You compared knowing a language to knowing a country's culture and diversity while not living in the country. That's not a good comparison because you can study a language but without living in a country you will never truly know how it is to live there.

dcofzon,Shifter25,"You realize that the electoral college, as it currently is, does nothing to stop the ""tyranny"" of a popular vote, right? It's still a mob rule, it's just that certain areas are decided to count more than others."
dcoj90t,Kieranwritessoccer,what areas count more than others?
dcojiyz,Shifter25,"Wyoming has 1/69 the population of California, but 1/19 the representation. That means that 1 Wyoming voter is worth 3 Californian voters."
dcojsjm,Kieranwritessoccer,"and 1 dc voter is worth 5 texan voters. what is your point? should DC voters or Wyoming votes not count? or should we have a system that counts votes proportionally, but ensures the proportion does not destroy lesser populated states?"
dcokdsc,Shifter25,"They should count equally. 1 DC voter should count the same as 1 Texan voter which should count the same as 1 Californian voter.Originally, the proportional representation was more fair. There was 1 representative per 30,000 people. Then in the early 1900's the House was arbitrarily capped at 435, and now California has a fraction of the representation it should have.A popularly voted President wouldn't ""destroy"" less populated states. Do you believe that cities should have less of a vote in gubernatorial races to give a voice to smaller towns?"
dcokp7z,Kieranwritessoccer,"i live in NYC, and personally I do believe smaller towns should have a bigger say in who their governor is."
dcol5r7,Shifter25,Why? Why should they get a bigger voice just because they live farther away from other people?

dcomoe5,JaxxedUp,"OF COURSE THEY ARE, they have that many more people in them, but if you look at the population to electoral college representation ratio, states with lower population still have greater representation than their population is representative of compared to states like California or New York."
dcopvg2,Z00T_Allures,"So there isn't a single state other than California or New York who's population is under-represented? I don't think we should measure the importance of a cultures values or beliefs over others simply due to the size of the cultures population. If the world elected a global president would you think it would be fair if China and India's representation counted for almost a 1/3 of the votes needed? Would you not think that politicians would be biased towards the values of those cultures because they need them to keep their jobs? That's exactly what Clinton did, she only catered to the cultures of population centers and that's why she lost. There are many people in America with different cultures and values. Don't you care about the farmer in Iowa and Nebraska who help feed the 1000's of people living in places that don't have the same values as him? The electoral college makes it to where that guys vote isn't totally irrelevant compared to the guy living in Cali."
dcoqu2s,JaxxedUp,"1 person's vote in california should equal 1 person's vote in Wyoming not have less representation. Just because you live in the boonies, your interests should lie ahead of the vast majority of the American population especially when urban centers are the money makers for our country. And yes she did and yes she lost according to a system that has long needed to be done away with. It's the same reason the majority of Americans do not like Trump nor do they want him to be president. Of course I care about the farmer in Iowa in Nebraska but not more than the Techie in LA or the Lawyer in New York which is how the system is currently skewed. Here have a source to put it in perspective: http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/map_of_the_week/2012/11/presidential_election_a_map_showing_the_vote_power_of_all_50_states.html"
dcotvu1,Z00T_Allures,Lol its never equaled one to one in california favor. It's represented by the state and california is single handedly a huge player in who gets elected and the ones you are talking about are not. They have fair representation not greater you numbnut.
dcoqe4z,Z00T_Allures,"Trump won 3,084 counties out of 3,141. I would say the outcome of the election reflected what was asked of the American people. Clinton only won 57..... out of over 3,000. Try to think critically about this I'm tired of seeing this un-American argument"
dcoqkmc,JaxxedUp,"What??? People vote, counties don't. Stop fucking cherry picking what determines a plurality. He lost by 3 million PEOPLE. End of story, just because the vast majority of people live in a few select counties don't mean the rest of a LAND MASS should have greater representation."
dcorftb,Z00T_Allures,"you sir. are ignorant. I don't care if she won by 20 million if they all came from the same area. Which they did in this case all being from California. The point of the electoral college was to protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority and its working. It was meant to give them fair not greater representation, which they don't have because your states votes are still worth waaayyyy more than theirs are. This is the American Way have some pride in that and try to be more compassionate towards our minorities"

dcorq7x,m3k1l13,Ignorant assumptions get you nowhere. And a vote can not be valued at any more or less than it's absolute value. 1 vote = 1 vote. The amount of electors and their aggregate votes doesn't change the value of votes. Basic math. Electors are established to keep voting fair so that the minority of the country doesn't overpower the majority.
dcouva3,TastyBrainMeats,">Ignorant assumptions get you nowhere. What>And a vote can not be valued at any more or less than it's absolute value. 1 vote = 1 vote. *What*.>The amount of electors and their aggregate votes doesn't change the value of votes.

At the end of the day you are trading one popular vote, of the people, with another popular vote of the state's electoral college. You can't have it both ways buddy."

dconut2,m3k1l13,"Smart guy, pleading for the popular vote IS establishing that 30% of the country would control 100% of the people. The only votes that would count, at all, would be NY and CA. It makes voting obsolete for the other 70% of the country."
dcooidj,KomradeKareBear,"That implies that ALL of California and ALL of New York vote democrat. Which simply isn't true. And while i can't speak for the latter i know the former quite well. And if you were to look at a map of how certain counties in California voted you'd see pockets of blue and large swaths of red. See, not only is this state diverse on the basis of ethnicity, but also on the basis of lifestyle. You drive about an hour away from the SF Bay Area and you'll find yourself in rural farm land much more reminiscent of Nebraska than the conservative vision of 'Commiefornia'."
dcoozh1,m3k1l13,"And your point is? You're merely pointing out how all of those red counties were not represented because of they were overwhelmed by the population heavy city vote. Good job. Why the popular vote doesn't work. Fairly, however, California had more counties that voted blue despite the ""large swathes"" of red. Better to concede political defeat by the fair accumulation the entire state than the unfair accumulation of just a few cities."
dcolapa,topestofkeks,So when 70000 votes decide the election in swing states that's called due process?
dcotbrq,DonkeyRider99,Yeah because the other 60 million people who voted for him didn't help him win
dcolnx4,Sonicmansuperb,"Well considering it makes the votes of every state count for the whole of its population and is also exactly as representative as the house and senate, it's equally as democratic as the legislature."
dcom4dr,topestofkeks,The flaw here is you have it based on a states whole population but you have a growing bracket (0-18) who can't even vote. Why are people who cannot vote being counted for electoral votes?
dcoo2xq,dang1010,"Because they still represent a portion of each states population, and are ultimately represented by the votes of their parents or gaurdians."
dcotv61,DonkeyRider99,What you want them to count as 3/5 of a person?
dcqzvut,topestofkeks,If they can't vote they shouldn't count at all
dconzbf,Sonicmansuperb,"Because they still have influence with their families, and will become voters at the same time as every other individual. What you're suggesting is we completely ignore that they exist and are part of a states population. But I do agree we should be appropriating electoral votes based upon the voting eligible population, but the implementation of that is too vulnerable to manipulation."

dcodch1,Tibbitts,If you really believe that then you should be against the electoral voters being bound to the popular vote and should applaud when they choose another president because the public chose unwisely.
dconlyu,Nosrac88,Why is that?
dcop08n,Tibbitts,"Because that is why the electors exist. They are supposed to, as was it was initially designed, be free agents who would vote their conscience so that a popular but unqualified person would not be elected president."
dcop7l9,Nosrac88,I am against bound electors legally. However they they have a moral obligation to vote as their state's populous did.

dcoolcv,Nosrac88,If she did she would still have one legitimately.
dcopeic,BGT456,There's a big difference between what's legitimate and what's right. Employers in the US for example can force you to make phone calls on behalf of the political party regardless of what your actual job is in fire you if you refuse to cooperate. Yet at the same time very few people would agree that's right but it's technically a completely legitimate reason to fire you.
dcobg3u,,"That's fine, that's a position that is reasonable, and one that I'm sure you would find supporters for on both sides of the aisle. The problem is, those were the rules before the election, and those have been the rules that every candidate has campaigned on. So, even though the position of removing the electoral college is reasonable, the position that Trump didn't win the presidency is not. It's like if you are playing a game of monopoly, and at the start agree to put money on free parking, then when the person you're playing against wins, you say ""actually, the rules state we shouldn't have had that money there, and since that's the only reason you won, I really won"". No, you can't change the rules AFTER the game is done (even if the rule was stupid in the first place)."
dconq3y,m3k1l13,"This guy has no idea how the election system works, does he? Didn't think so."
dcopy92,TheOriginalSkeeze,"Okay so popular vote now is law,campaigns adjust to fit the new system which means they campaign in the top 10 or so most populous cities because they can now ignore the rural states which often have widely different policy priorities due to circumstances around them.

dcohdha,jaywalker32,Well she didn't campaign at all in Wisconsin. Her lack of campaigning in swing states and her side's repeated reference to the 'popular vote' leads one to believe that they didn't know what the fuck they were doing.
dcohquk,Gustacho,"She did campaign in swing states. Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio. She underestimated Trump's support in the states I mentioned before, plus Wisconsin indeed. It's a matter of data she didn't have or misinterpreted. The popular vote is how most presidents are elected. Austria last year, France this year. Every vote counts as one. And big cities aren't enough to secure a victory. The biggest 100 cities in America (the 100th with a population of 200 000) only account for less than 20% of the population."
dcoi9iu,jaywalker32,"> The popular vote is how most presidents are elected Doesn't matter if that's how literally every other president is elected. It's not the way the US President is elected. And if you're running for president, you are supposed to know this."
dcoispb,Gustacho,"The debate is not how it is, but how it should be."

How is that fair?> I feel you were grossly misinformed about what kind of country this is, it isn't a pure democracy for a reason.Yes, for two reasons in particular:1. The founding fathers were not convinced that the voters could always vote in their own best interest. That is why the electors were supposed to be able to counteract the popular vote if they thought it was wrong. What of that remains today?2. Slave owners in Virginia argued that there should be proportional representation instead of a popular vote, so that they could have the weight of their slaves behind their votes."

It forces candidates to pursue votes in all different areas."

The electoral college exists for a reason. It is doing exactly what it is supposed to. But the people who were fairly voted into the electoral college by each state didn't vote the person you want in, so let's just scrap something that has worked for hundreds of years and is still working because it didn't work for you. Let's just change the laws so you and people who think like you always win, and there can never be a dissenting viewpoint. I'm sure that's what you'd prefer."
dcoeru2,Gustacho,"The philosophical ideals of the constitution are timeless, the electoral college is not. It was purely practical: Electors were people who noted the votes of the people, and then went to Washington to come together and announce the votes. The biggest 100 cities (the 100th biggest having a population of 200 000) of America account for less than 20% of the vote. Candidates have to visit more than just the cities. And this system encourages candidates to campaign in swing states! I haven't seen a lot of campaign rallies in Oregon, Massachusetts, Louisiana or Kansas.

It's not that the election results were a fluke and he defied the odds--there's a reason the immediate discussion after the election was that the polls were wrong.What I'm trying to say is the 10% odds that some pundits assigned to Trump were just wrong, and you can't just use the argument that a non zero number makes it OK because statistically he has some chance. Even 538's 25% or whatever they gave him was likely wrong--the reason being the local polls were wrong.

[Here](https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2415) is the poll you're all riding off of.The ""34%"" approval rating you speak of is the percent of people that believe Trump will be a better president than Obama. 45% say he will be worse, and another 15% say he will be the same. The polls don't account for that 15%. In fact, they completely disregard it and claim Trump's approval rating is 34%.Comparably, this is [Obama's approval rating.](https://qz.com/889644/obamas-approval-rating-from-his-first-day-to-his-last-in-charts/) You notice how it hits 40% several times? Low ratings are inevitable, especially for someone like Trump that doesn't have Obama's charisma, an undeserved nobel peace prize, guaranteed support from +80% of African-Americans, and fair media representation in the months leading up to his inauguration. In addition, these approval ratings are more personality and appearance than policies, so many people's ""I think he'll be a poor president"" is less a reflection of how they think he'll do and more what 'alleged' Trump scandal they're spoon fed.That is the reality of it."

dcoib03,shh_as_i_eat_ur_food,"Trump's approval rating is still pretty poor. Incoming presidents tend to have higher approval rating that then decay over time. Of course, some things will raise a president's approval rating above their initial rating (like the Iraq War in W Bush's case), but it is a general trend to stick to. Comparing it to Obama's mid-term approval rating is misleading, as most presidencies tend to lose approval rating over time.Fox, a more conservative outlet, states his approval rating at 42%, released yesterday: (http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/01/19/fox-news-poll-divided-yet-optimistic-country-awaits-trump.html) ""Modern"" president initial approval ratings that show Trump as being unpopular compared to other new presidents (admittedly a week or two after inauguration):(http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/initial_approval.php)Fun polls from Gallup to show how approval ratings change over the duration of a presidency: (http://www.gallup.com/poll/116677/presidential-approval-ratings-gallup-historical-statistics-trends.aspx)"

So when the official polls say it 50-40 for Clinton (most were significantly closer than this) it means Clinton has a 50% chance of winning, and Trump has a 40% chance of winning.

dcoamwe,JimmyMac80,The definition of plurality is the number of votes cast for a candidate who receives more than any other but does not receive an **absolute majority.**
dcoaoea,SmokeWordsEveryDay,So we should use plurality. Unless the intent is to be misleading.
dcoau6v,JimmyMac80,"Why? Clinton got the majority of votes, it doesn't matter that she didn't take an absolute majority."
dcoavbp,SmokeWordsEveryDay,It absolutely matters. Therefore: plurality.
dcob2vv,JimmyMac80,Why does it matter?
dcobbqj,SmokeWordsEveryDay,Because the first is an attempt to make it seem like an absolute majority of Americans who vote didn't vote against Hillary Clinton. Which is a lie. An ABSOLUTE majority of Americans rejected both candidates. Who cares who got more votes after that?
dcocpx4,JimmyMac80,">An ABSOLUTE majority of Americans rejected both candidates.This is an assumption, you're assuming that the roughly 40% of people who didn't vote rejected both candidates. There's plenty of reasons besides rejecting both major candidates that could have stopped them from voting.As for why it matters that Trump didn't even take a simple majority of people who voted? It's quite simple, Trump and his supporters are acting like the entire nation is behind Trump and his agenda and that's not even close to true. So it needs to be repeatedly pointed out, in the hopes that those who are in the government don't forget that they serve the entire country. A country where the **majority** of people who voted chose Clinton, not Trump."
dcoepl7,Mouthtuom,"This is a ridiculous false measure. Since when does an ""absolute majority"" have any meaning in a Presidential election? She objectively won a majority of the votes, that can't be argued. If he won a ""plurality"" of the votes, by definition he has no mandate. At the end of the day, his presidency is the result of one of the weakest wins in American history."
dcof7mq,SmokeWordsEveryDay,"So absolute majority has no meaning, but a weaker plurality DOES have meaning? Do you even read what you type between froth-wipings?"
dcoi4ho,Mouthtuom,When was absolute majority a measure of the Presidency? I never said plurality has no meaning. Leave the pathetic bullshit out of the discussion if you want to be taken seriously.
dcoidqo,SmokeWordsEveryDay,"If absolute majority isn't a measure, then plurality is by definition even less of a measure. Therefore, discussions of Hillary getting more votes are meaningless. And they ARE meaningless. Did you see who just got inaugurated?"
dcoinsw,Mouthtuom,"Wait, wasn't it you that said plurality initially anyway? At this point it appears that you are more interested in winning an argument than the actual content of the discussion. All these things can be true at the same time. He won the election, she won the majority of votes and they effectively gained a plurality of the votes. At the end of the day he is the President, but has no mandate. That is the root of this discussion. He claims he won in a ""landslide"" that is objectively false. He has no mandate and actually won with one of the weakest wins in history. None of these facts take away from the fact that he is now the President."

dcozft3,,http://www.dictionary.com/browse/electionNowhere in the definition do I see that an election has to be by popular vote. Yes there are popular vote elections but there are also other types of elections. In this case there are many historical and political reasons we do not use the popular vote to decide the president of the United States. One of these reasons in that we're a union of smaller semi-independent states and not only have a shared federal governing body but also smaller independent state governing bodies.
dconchg,ggyujjhi,"No, he won the goddamn election. Period. If Hillary wanted to win she could have went to one of the swing states once and grabbed a few thousand more votes and she would have won.

It simply shifts the target of discrimination, formerly they were discriminating against homophobes, now they're discriminating against LGBT people. And homophobes are not an oppressed group. People aren't denied housing or medical care for thinking marriage should be between a man and a woman. Furthermore, being LGBT is not imposing on anyone else, being homophobic is.

dcoib1k,ithoughtsobitch,"Woman bragged about getting rapist off the hook, married to a actual rapist - later runs for President while under multiple FBI investigations. **HAHA**"
dcoigrk,00Chubby,"It's not entirely unprecedented, the 42nd president lied under oath about that kind of thing."
dcoiqcj,lord_balathustrius,So is this an excuse for shitty behavior? Cause it isn't a good one.
dcoj4ul,00Chubby,"It's not, Trump is an asshole.But the other candidate defended a rapist and then laughed at and mocked the victim, and her husband (a former presidnet) is *known for disrespecting women*. The post is pointing out how hypocritical you guys are, given that **LITERALLY JESUS** Bill and Hillary are accused of and have been proven of doing things much, much worse than Trump, yet it's ignored."
dcojpud,lord_balathustrius,"It's not being hypocritical, at all. Hillary never bragged about sexual assault. Hillary Clinton never mocked a victim. These are all allegations that have zero evidence behind them. Literally none of these people could make a case. Not one. And AGAIN none of this goes to the false equivocation between defending a husband who may or may not have sexual assaulted people to a man who literally bragged about it."
dcommr5,00Chubby,"And all of the allegations against Trump are with the same amount of merit as the ones against Bill. And Bill has a history of women saying he made them feel extremely uncomfortable. Hillary, after describing how her client (accused of raping a 12 year old) passed a lie detector, was recorded saying that it destroyed her faith in lie detectors and laughed about it, and also has been understood as trying to shut down Bill Clinton's accusers.And if you don't remember, Bill lied under oath about demeaning sexual conduct. Replace ""Clinton"" with ""Trump"" and I guarantee all of this would be on the front page every day."

dco8x0f,bschott007,"Depends. Most assassinations of Presidents have been by the left. You may not get 4 years of him.More attempts (successful or not) have been made by 'the left' than 'the right'. That is just a fact.Edit: this isnt a threat. This is pointing out facts. The most I'll do is break open a really expensive whiskey, shoot off fireworks and leave my flag flying full staff."
dco7t7j,SmokeWordsEveryDay,The tantrum continues
dco82m3,HealthyDebtlover,"140 characters at a time, the first @POTUS tantrum will probably be the most depressing"
dco881y,SmokeWordsEveryDay,"Yeah I meant the tantrum of ""r/politics"" (i.e. r/butthurt)"
dco8gow,HealthyDebtlover,"Sure, while certainly getting carried away, people are just concerned for the future. The lack of ability to give citizens of this country any confidence in him is very concerning."
dco8mhg,SmokeWordsEveryDay,If they were concerned they would do something more productive than spamming biased articles on a forum that's *supposed* to not be one-sided. They are emotionally angsty and hive-minding. I have no sympathy.
dco9jih,Beelzebot44,"It isn't supposed h to be anything. It's supposed to reflect the views of the members, which it does. All it means is that more people oppose Trump than support him, and that is reflected in the content of the sub as well as the popular vote totals of the election."
dcoaavr,SmokeWordsEveryDay,"No, because this sub is specifically moderated to support one opinion over others. The fact is he became president. If this sub was indicative of anything that wouldn't have happened. Period."
dcobwvw,Beelzebot44,If you look at the demographic that regularly uses reddit you would see that group was overwhelmingly against Trump. His support came mainly from groups that don't use the internet as much as the groups that oppose him.
dcoc1wi,SmokeWordsEveryDay,Trump got a larger portion of young voters than any republican in recent elections. Reddit is intentionally skewed.

dco8xmz,,[deleted]
dco93wr,oscarleesersmom,Look at his post history. His having a tantrum over us having a tantrum.
dco91ff,SmokeWordsEveryDay,"Every single post every single day for the last 4 months has been anti Donald trump. What has been achieved by that? Can you point to a substantive result of that one-sidedness? Can you make an argument for that being time well spent, or even an argument as to it being fair to have a ""politics"" subreddit singlemindedly devoted to tearing down the President? Can you do any of that?"
dco9ek1,HealthyDebtlover,"I would love for the ""politics"" subreddit to have an even distribution of articles for and against, or just unbiased at all. This has come up a few times, but the resulting answer is usually that there just aren't any positive articles. Then the response is that the ""media"" is against him. Sure, a lot are, but there are also plenty of pro-trump publications, you post them and i'll read them. The ones I have read seem to lack and substance behind what he is promising. The proposals he promises that I like (increase manufacturing jobs and reduce my taxes), I don't know how he is going to do it because there is no plan to accomplish it. The things I disagree with (a damn wall, repeal aca), he also doesn't seem to have much of a plan for. It just seems like he is selling all day, but then once everyone has agreed to buy his crap we'll realize it isn't worth the price."
dcohrcw,SmellyPeen,"I wonder how r/The_Meltdown is doing? Seems like they should be on r/all today, just screencap this thread lol."
dcohu1a,SmokeWordsEveryDay,"Unfortunately the Reddit admins are big babies who can't handle anything than liberal opinions on their website. It's okay though, President Trump will do his work regardless."
dcogexi,prkrrlz,"This is the most polluted, hate-filled, bias subreddit I have ever been on."
dcoiwzh,,/r/politics is shit
dcoj5ax,Kodyak77,Has r/politics always been this biased?Yikes.
dcojdg6,Agentwise,"Yeah they've been like this forever, this is just the first time they've lost in a way that's visible to a larger part of the sub."
dcokmw4,Kodyak77,"I'm not a political person and don't really care who won the presidency. But you'd think a subreddit called ""r/politics"" would be a little more distinguishable from ""r/EnoughTrumpSpam"""
dcokvfa,Agentwise,Well Reddit as a whole is largely left-leaning. So expecting a place that is essentially run by liberals (the mods and user base) to not lean politically in that direction isn't very realistic.
dcojved,lamlime,"it was fun when bernie sanders was running and every article was just bashing hillary clinton and Trump was totally ignoredthen it quickly shifted to hillary is our queen, and donald trump is responsible for all bad things ever"
dcon2vg,CreeperCrafter63,So directly stating what Trump said is biased?
dco7hb4,bhlowe,That's how bad the other candidate was.
dco83aq,Discflame,"Correction: That's how bad the news media messed up in coverage of important events, carefully selecting news pieces to boost ratings instead of choosing pieces to inform, influencing voters instead of staying unbiased."
dco8p0r,WooTs_67,"> That's how bad the news media messed up in coverage What?The media did everything they could to get her elected, and still failed. That is how bad of a candidate she was."
dco87e8,uptotwentycharacters,So bad that they came in first place by the popular vote?
dcoao77,kernelsaunders,"Do you not understand the rules of the game here? Popular vote was never the goal, that's how the election works. The goal was to get the most electoral votes, popular vote means nothing.When you play a certain card game, you can't use rules from another card game to justify your win. So it is completely irrelevant that she got popular vote."
dcoat1q,uptotwentycharacters,"I'm not saying here that the popular vote should determine who becomes president. Trump won in accordance with our procedure for selecting presidents. However, the popular vote is still a useful measure of popularity/likability. So if Hillary coming in first place for popularity makes her a bad candidate, then Trump must be even worse, unless you define ""bad candidate"" in such a way that a bad candidate can be more popular/likable than a good one."
dcob5ay,kernelsaunders,"Neither one of them was likeable, which makes popular vote even more irrelevant. Very many people voted for one candidate just because they hated the other one more."
dcob8ep,uptotwentycharacters,"Which still means Trump is hated more than Hillary - so Hillary comes out ahead in popularity, even if it's more ""less unpopular"" than ""more popular""."
dcon96e,,A democrat winning California isn't a huge achievement.
dcp0nsu,uptotwentycharacters,"Who said anything about achievement? The idea of an election isn't supposed to be some game you try to win, it's supposed to see who the people support more. It doesn't really matter if some of Hillary's votes came from traditional democratic strongholds - she represents the Democratic party, and those regions have a reason for tending to support Democrats."

dcohxr4,dmizenopants,NBC is salty as fuck about the Inauguration of Trump

dcojwj8,lord_balathustrius,Find me one Trump Supporter who doesn't fit what I said. Literally one.
dcolayw,piraticalnerve,I dont think the people who voted for him realized he was such an asshole. Then again maybe since theyre assholes they wanted an asshole to represent them. Honestly I cant tell the idiots from the assholes so I lump them all together as trumpers
dcolv4g,dmizenopants,"closeminded much? Isn't that what the left accuses the right of being, yet here we are. So what about the protesters that are inciting violence right now? Are those guys assholes too?"
dcoo2vo,piraticalnerve,inciting violence? You must be confused.I see people exercising their right to assembly. Is that what you're referring to?
dcoo806,dmizenopants,"So you don't see the folks throwing bricks at the police, lighting trashcans on fire, breaking car windows, etc? Guess we have a different opinion of what it means to excercising ones right to assembly peacefully"
dcooclr,piraticalnerve,i'm not seeing any of that.Whats your source? Where are you seeing all of this? Are you making shit up and spreading lies again?
dcooqnt,dmizenopants,"Again? Please do tell what lies i spread the first time, because there would have to be a first time for me to be doing it again. Sounds to me like you've gotten a little butthurt. Watching it on NBC right now, which I'm pretty sure is salty as fuck about Trump, yet they are reporting it. But pretty sure you are adept enough to google it, Twitter it, or even Facebook it. Godspeed grasshopper, and keep your mind openEdit: GoogleFu shall be your friend. Take a second and use it and you'll get a plethora of articles. And I'm sure you'll return to offer an apology or a downvote. I'm betting on the silent downvote"
dcows1g,piraticalnerve,"did what you asked. Peaceful assemblies in every major city! No widespread looting or vandalism, violence, etc...You are a fucking liar."
dcoxtkp,dmizenopants,"I'm honestly dumbfounded by your ignorance. I figured anyone that has the internet savvy of an 8 yr old would be able to google ""protest in Washington DC"" and then read the result. Don't know how old your are, but I'll bet it's older than 8.

Also, never said widespread. Just said there were some protesters reacting violently. 95-100 arrested, property damaged, 2 officers hurt. That's just today, tomorrow the larger protest are planned. Hope you have a lovely evening"
dcoy60x,piraticalnerve,2 officers. So let me get this straight. Your whole carnage and mayhem take on these NATIONWIDE DEMONSTRATIONS is over two officers getting treated for minor injuries that they werent even admitted as inpatients for. You are fucking hilarious. Either that or you are the biggest drama queen on reddit.
dcoyo9o,dmizenopants,"Did I say there were folks violently protesting? YepWere they? YepDid you ask for a source? YepDid I provide? YepDid you say you saw nothing but people excercising their right to assembly and there were not violence? YepDid I provide relevant information that is being widely reported on by every major news source that contradicted you uninformed opinion? Sure didDid I say there was widespread carnage and mayhem running amok in the nations capital? Nope, that's just your poor reading comprehension. Again, hope you have a wonderful evening"
dcoyvlm,piraticalnerve,you know how far you stretched the truth (2 cops with minor injuries) just to paint a wildly inaccurate picture. Shame on you. Your bullshit got called. Peaceful assembly as is our constitutional right. Nobody being assholes just americans exercising their freedoms.
dcoz2vu,dmizenopants,[awww](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/R390EId)
dcp0qde,piraticalnerve,when you quote sources you have to check if one of the articles lists the other article ( associated press wire) as its author. You literally just took three different publications of the same article from the a.p. wire and (i'm sure unknowingly) tried to pass them on to me as three different sources.
dcoutkj,piraticalnerve,i never downvote. Its childish and lame.
dcoxz65,dmizenopants,"Yes but accusing someone of lying when you failed to do the appropriate research, that's no where near childish and lame. Amirite?"
dcoye7c,piraticalnerve,you are lying. You are trying to paint a wildly inaccurate picture of todays peaceful assemblies. If you had any morals at all or any fucking pride you wouldnt be spreading your bullshit But here you are on reddit trying to make the world believe your bullshit. get fucked you asshole.
dcoyvzw,dmizenopants,"Feel free to check my sources, or you know, watch the news. My my, I must have struck a nerve. Such colorful language from an internet savvy person that's older than 8. Hope your evening is lovely my friend"
dcoz1og,piraticalnerve,"I did check your sources (actually it was one source). Hundreds of thousands of protesters, thousands of protests and all youve got is two cops with minor injuries.\"
dcoz9mv,dmizenopants,"I guess you missed the whole rest of every major news agency that was covering the inauguration reported the same thing as I relayed to you. Multiple sources...multiplePssttt...I linked 4, not 1. But hey, let's not facts get into the way of this riveting conversation Edit: whoops, i stopped at 3"
dcp0s2r,piraticalnerve,you linked four articles from the same a.p wire post. one article with multiple publishers is still one source.
dcp0zhs,piraticalnerve,i just realized you must have thought 6 officers were hurt. (2+2+2 =6 not knowing all publications were about the same two officers). Did you not notice how all of your sources were the same exact fucking story? Youre the funniest fucking guy ever.
dcp53dx,dmizenopants,"Actually 6 officers were hurt (I originally said 2), but thanks for the correction. 200 something protesters were arrested. Doesn't sound like those 200 were peacefully excercising their right to assembly. I only linked 3 (something tells me you didn't even bother to click any of them) not 4. 3 different news publications, 6 different reporters, 3 different sources, 3 different stories, none of them credit A.P. as their source. There are plenty more news agencies reporting on the same thing, but it seems you care nothing for the facts. Are you still denying that some protesters decided to show their anger by turning violent? Because that's what you originally denied, while calling me a liar. Actually the original question was, do you consider those that decided to protest violently today, asshole or just the people that voted for Trump? Cheers mate"

dcoerix,bucket935,"Exactly, everyone's a prostitute at some point"

dcoegw7,Beelzebot44,"You can't have consent through coercion. If someone is afraid of the consequences of not going along, that isn't consent."
dcoekp9,CrustyGrundle,"Yea and there is absolutely no reason to believe that they were coerced. And no, the other person being rich and famous is not valid evidence."
dcoeqpp,Beelzebot44,No evidence outside the women who came forward and said as much.
dcofwys,CrustyGrundle,"Exactly, which doesn't mean anything."
dcofzlv,Beelzebot44,So testimony from victims of sexual assault doesn't mean anything?

dcogogf,mrfabi,Good luck winning against a billionarie.
dcojfft,ShitOutTheBooze,This is the real reason Trump won. It isn't because liberals hurt their feelings...It's because basic human decency and empathy is something Trump supporters are incapable of experience.
dcoom3r,CrustyGrundle,Or because we don't automatically believe someone who suddenly claims they were sexually assaulted at an incredibly opportune time?

Replacing ""a guy/girl"" with ""someone"" as /u/R3DSMiLE would seem to be the best option.Also, grammatical gender like Spanish has is really only tangentially related to gender-neutral language. Grammatical gender has to do with assigning every noun a ""gender"" (typically masculine, feminine, or neuter) and changing word/sentence forms based on that. Gender-neutral language on the other hand refers to using non-gender specific language when referring to entities that actually do have a gender (like people or animals)."

Bury your head in the sand and trust in your god-emperor all you want, but when you realize you've been duped we'll be ready to talk."
dcoit88,StanTheRebel,You hope America will fail because it will make you feel better.
dcoj7ea,SITB,"Not at all. I want America to succeed and be the best it can be. Unfortunately, our government has a long history of serving the interests of the wealthy elite rather than the majority of citizens, and I'm fairly confident that under Trump with all his hate, greed, bigotry, anti intellectualism, and gross ineptitude we will see this pattern on steroids. I want a strong healthy democracy that provides tangible benefits for all its people and not just a wealthy few."
dconzy0,phukka,"Conservatives have been warning the world for five years that they wouldn't keep rolling over and letting America run wild with socialist SJW policies, but Dems didn't listen or waver, and now you're paying the price for the next four years, minimum. Liberals have been smug for years about their progressivism and now have to deal with that."
dcoomh3,SITB,"And which socialist, SJW policies are you talking about? Inequality has gotten worse, not better in recent years. The majority of the country supports equality and tolerance, action on climate change, strong support for education, and more equitable distribution of wealth. Whether you are liberal or conservative, we all need to recognize that this Republican vs Democrat fight isn't the real fight. The real fight is 1% vs 99%. Never in history does this level of inequality sustain itself. Trump's kleptocracy will wreak havoc on all of us. He will throw working conservatives and liberals alike under the bus to enrich himself and his allies. The sooner we realize we are all really on the same side, the sooner we can find common ground and work together on the things we agree on. Trump does not care about you. I don't think Clinton did much either. Our government is indebted to the wealthy elite, and Trump is the absolute worst of this condition we have seen so far."
dcop8z0,phukka,"I agree with literally everything you said, and I'm sure many other Conservatives do as well, but if nothing more than a symbolic movement away from the left and their push towards more socialist policies or merely SJW/intersectional feminist stances, Conservatives needed to fight back. People were tired of being considered the enemy, or racist, or sexist, or fascist when they didn't do anything but hold different values. Do those people exist? Of course, but many Republicans are just typical middle class Americans trying to do right by their families, and I for one will absolutely not tolerate some 19 year old call me a monster because of my fiscal policy beliefs, or social stances (especially when many of my social stances are fairly liberal)."
dcp6rxp,SITB,"Well which policies do you mean? I'm admittedly probably more open to socialist ideas than you might be, but I still don't think of we've gone very far left recently. With the Republican Congress and Senate blocking Obama at every turn, not much has gotten done. I don't mean to demonize you or the average Republican voter, but the Republicans in office have shown themselves to not care about this country time and time again. Both sides are far too indebted to corporatist influences, but the Republican officials are far more openly hostile to the working class, the majority of the people, and basic scientific evidence. I realize that people on the left can go too far, and that it's easy to alienate people, but from my point of view anyone who voted for Trump is at least passively accepting of racism, fascism, bigotry or willful ignorance. I also believe Trump himself is a fascist, and that anyone who supports him to spite the left is only hurting themselves."

They have no comprehension of the fact that he's a part of the 1% (allegedly... tax returns) and has spent his entire career. Some Trump supporters will come around once they realize they've been duped, but many of them will go to the grave believing he was their savior.I'm just waiting until he gets us into a war. People somehow believe him when he says he's antiwar, but he will trip over himself to invade or bomb the shit out of some poorer country just so he and his fellow fascists can obtain more money."
dcom2a4,GeekofFury,"Can we please not make this about identity politics, please? I'm a guy with health insurance through work, and I pass for white. It isn't going to be a good 4 years for me, because:- I care about folks having insurance and not dying because they couldn't get covered.- Facts are important to me, like the science that proves climate change is real and is being dangerously accelerated by human activity. Like how ""clean coal"" may be cleaner than traditional coal, but it's not clean.- I care about women not being grabbed at the pussy.- I care about wealth inequality, and realize that after 40 years of trickle down economics, that shit doesn't work and only serves to make the rich even richer, and the rest of us even poorer.- I care about public education not being gutted in favor of private education. Students getting the best education possible should always be more important than the ""bottom line"" at a school.- While I think we should be more vigilant about illegal immigration, the system for legal immigration should be overhauled, made to be much shorter and easier to navigate FIRST. The wall is a stupid idea that will be too expensive, and as soon as it's tunneled under, will be ineffective.- I care about us NOT persecuting people out of fear. Japanese internment happened. McCarthyism happened. Let's not return to that by persecuting muslims (though we do need to talk about how to find and keep out potential terrorists).- I care about having executive cabinet that knows what they are doing and aren't out to plunder / pummel the world to make themselves richer.- I care about having a President that has enough maturity NOT to get into schoolyard fights on Twitter about shit that shouldn't matter to the POTUS.- I care about NOT having a government that very well may be a puppet for the Russians. Holy shit.I could go on, but I suppose I've gone on too long. Divisive attitudes about people is part of why Trump won. Let's work together and try to elect better leaders and organize grass roots efforts to make sure the government represents the people as a whole, instead of select groups."

Can you please elaborate on that argument?I'm a veteran who only recently became extremely involved with politics thanks to Jim Webb first, then ultimately Sanders. During the primaries, I was a total BernieBro; I donated, spread the word, everything. Simultaneously, I learned more and more about the scandals surrounding the Clintons, as well as dealing with the constant BS that came with the DNC. Trust me friend, I learned to absolutely despise the DNC and Clinton. And although she's more or less a fart in the wind now, I still feel the same way about her/DNC.Yet, even with this being the case, I positively could not rationalize voting Trump over Clinton. For me, they both were bad for America—and they both talked the big talk during their campaigning, but I didn't believe any of it. With this in mind, it makes sense to me to make a pros and cons list of the two and sadly, vote for the lesser of two evils. Looking at their credentials, credibility, past history, those they are involved with, and ultimately their qualifications (because being President is a serious job, not just a TV spot or popularity contest)—she came out on top every time. It pained me to do so, but the only logical person to vote for was Clinton.Now I'm not judging you or trying to attack you in any way, I was just giving my quick two-cents.

If you actually heard the whole conversation, rather than the cherry picked sound bite, you would understand this us just banter amongst friends. Let's not forget this happened over 11 YEARS AGO? It was pure locker room banter. This was only shit they could bring up? No wonder he beat a crooked old woman, with a rapist for husband."
dcqyx9l,CannedBread5eva,"Did I touch a nerve? So from what you're telling me, bragging about sexually assaulting women is fine as long at it was fine before? Did he do some maturing between the ages of 60 and 70? Him talking like that I hasn't been ok in any locker room I've been in. I like how you easily believe Bill Clinton is a rapist, yet you vehemently defend Trump who's faced similar accusations."

dcotwxq,EdwardRMeow,Locker room? That was a bus. SAD!
dcpj3pe,demoraliza,"It's called locker room talk, or banter. Let me guess, you didn't read the rest of the transcripts? It's actually pretty funny, but liberals don't have a sense of humour, and just lap up what the media say. Ignorant morons."
dcq5iml,MescalPascal,It wasn't in a locker room. It was during taping for a national TV show. Everyone was wearing mics and being followed by cameras. They knew they were being taped. Stop lying.

dcoal35,austofferson,"Here's the difference, we have proof that trump is a sexist and a racist. While it's not fair to judge someone based on who they support, it's at least based in reason. Trump is a sexist and a racist, so why support him if you aren't one? While it's obviously true that most of his supporters simply voted for him because Clinton was a dogshit candidate, it still stands to reason that voting for someone who is on tape and on record as being massively misogynistic and racist at the very least makes you sympathetic to those ideas."
dcoogbp,Mohammed_Christ,> a racistYou don't.
dcop689,austofferson,You mean the court cases he lost for discriminating against black people at his real estate properties? Uhhh yeah I fuckin do.
dcoby4o,topmemeladdy,"Not at the least. I know that this argument is quite controversial but I truly do believe that what he said regarding women was indeed 'locker room banter.' We've all done it. We've all at some point thought about women in such a way and may have even jokingly talked with friends about it. It makes Trump more human and relatable to the common man. One major flaw in your argument on racism and sexism. It is simply insensitive. Sure he's said things that were biased in some ways but they do not constitute sexism nor racism. To say it does undermines true acts of racism such as the Holocaust or any other genocidal act that sought to systematically end a race. On a colloquial level we may call it 'racism' and 'sexism' but in an intellectual and political discourse, Trump's words were simply biased and bias is found within all of us. Whether it's to a certain race or to women, our human instincts have made bias innate and an unavoidable fact of life. Once again, this makes Trump seem more human and not a Politically Correct puppet."

dcoo0yx,Irctoaun,Did you even read what you quoted? That suggest Trump is the most racist person because he has the greatest ability of anyone on earth to 'carry out systematic discriminatory practices through the major institutions of our society.' That's literally the definition mental sjw people use to say it's impossible to be racist against white people
dcow5ps,topmemeladdy,Today is his first day in office. He hasn't established any racist institutions thus far. It's unjust to not give him a chance and make unfair claims of racism against him.
dcoxveb,Irctoaun,"He's racist because he's said racist things. Your definition doesn't change anything. When he gets into office doesn't change anything. Him saying the things he has said on the platform he had has already caused a paradigm shift in the way some people behave around Muslims and other immigrants. By saying these racist things, he has normalised a way of thinking and behaving which is inherently racist. The same thing happened in the UK after the brexit vote. Hate crimes against immigrants spiked very sharply after the vote because the rhetoric during the debate was all anti immigrant so people thought it was ok nowIf he comes into office and eases racial tensions then great. I'll take everything back and admit I was wrong but until then..."
dcomdhh,Sirwootalot,"I have never once ever *thought*, much less said, anything even 1/10th as rapey as Trump's ""locker room talk"". You may have done it, and perhaps some of your friends and male relatives may have too, but I sure as fuck haven't."
dcoc6ue,austofferson,"No, ""real racism"" isn't just genocide, that's absurd. And he is a documented racist because he has lost court cases based on racial discrimination. Is he a changed man? Maybe. Has he done fuckin anything to make me think he is? Absolutely not.And no, that's not just locker room banter, idk what fuckin locker room you're in. Locker room banter might be talking about how much you want a fuck a woman or how attractive she is, and the specific language used is irrelevant. You can say ""I wanna grab her by the pussy"" and I'm fine, I'll defend that as normal guy talk all day. But saying ""when you're a celebrity you can just do it, you can do anything, you can just grab em by the pussy"" means that he has actually done it. He has actually sexually assaulted women, and in order to sexually assault a woman, you have to view them as less than yourself, as a man."

dcoi0qk,philosarapter,"So your argument is that he has bragged about doing something that he has never actually done? I mean if you read his quote in context, he was telling a story about making moves on a married woman. So either he's lying and making up a story to 'sound cool', or he actually did what he said and has sexually assaulted women. So which is it? Is he a liar or a sexual predator?"
dcogilc,mrfabi,"It's actually a pretty reasonable conclusion, there must be a reason that he knows that, he probably has abused his power on women for a long time."

dcon19c,Al-Shakir,"And he also says...""they let you do it.""The whole point of his story is to say how women are more willing to assent to powerful and famous men becoming sexual with them.For that to *ipso facto* amount to sexual assault requires an assumption that a power imbalance automatically results in compulsion. Not everyone shares that view, but most feminists do.Grabbing a woman ""by the pussy"" isn't assault if the woman consents to it. There's no evidence the women did not consent. There's only his story...where he says they did indeed let him do it. Whether that amounts to consent or not is an open question."
dconbs5,my_knee_grows,"He literally says that he ""just starts kissing them without waiting"" which implies that there is no discussion of consent, he just does it without asking. ""They let you do it"" in context of the full statement reads more like ""They don't stop me"" which is absolutely **not** consent. If you rape someone who's unconscious they're not going to stop you, that doesn't mean they consented to it."
dconwpm,Al-Shakir,">If you rape someone who's unconscious they're not going to stop you, that doesn't mean they consented to it.Of course if you rape someone that doesn't mean they consented, that's obvious. In fact, if you rape someone, they did not consent.There doesn't have to be a discussion of consent or an asking for there to be consent. Some feminists and others think that all consent must be affirmative and explicit. That is not the standard view in most jurisdictions nor among many people.I agree that ""they let you do it"" does not mean there was consent. It also doesn't mean there wasn't consent, just as ""they don't stop you"". You could apply that phrase to people who do not consent and to people who do consent. Whether there was consent or not is an open question."
dcojkw1,topmemeladdy,There's no doubt he said that. But there is no proof that it actually happened. I can say that I'm a multi trillionaire and I secretly own Honduras. There's hard evidence showing I said that but absolutely no evidence showing that what I said is true.

dcolvom,bowies_dead,But he said that it happened.
dcomsuu,my_knee_grows,"What proof do you want? He said himself that he did it. That's a confession. Confessions get you convicted in court (in other words, a confession *is* proof). To rebut that would be to call him a liar, in which case my question still stands"
dcow315,topmemeladdy,He wasn't in court when he made those statements.
dcoz4ca,my_knee_grows,"I'm aware of that, my point was just that a confession of guilt in our system is considered ""proof"" so the only way to say there is no ""proof"" is to say that he is a liar and you don't believe what he said"
dcowdz2,ariagrayx,Wow. I feel sad for any women in your life.
dcol69g,BlckMrkt,So he's either a sexual predator or a liar?Did you bother to look at the corner you were backing yourself in to?
dcoj252,mrfabi,"Look, there are nuances, abuse on women is not always the use of physical force to make her do something that she does not want to.

dcoiagq,austofferson,"And I'm not saying he did, but when you hear the shit that he has said and you see him accused multiple times, to still defend him is disgusting. I do. Thane a problem with people that just don't want to jump to conclusions with the cases, that makes perfect sense, but to not take a step back and say ""wait a second, let's figure all this out before I keep relentlessly defending him on every single issue"" is ridiculous.And to respond to your edit, [yes it does](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+racism). Discriminating against someone because of their race is literally the definition of racism. You don't get to rewrite definitions to fit your narrative."
dcoj7bg,topmemeladdy,"It's not disgusting at all. What your arguing essentially is that if enough people blame someone of something, they are under the presumption of guilt. This puts the accused in a position in which they must prove their innocence whereas in the United States, individuals are granted the presumption of innocence. ""Innocent until proven guilty."""
dcojhw8,austofferson,"No, that's absolutely not what I'm arguing. I said not to condemn them, but I said to continue mercilessly defending someone who is *on recorded video* saying that he has sexually assaulted women is disgusting. I'm not saying he is guilty, so don't take your strawman to me. I'm saying that there is proof that he has done it from his own mouth, and then charges are brought against him. What the fuck would anyone say in that situation, of course he will say he's been joking. And it's possible that he was.

It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country.

The only way to not have innocents killed is to not be in a war, just like the only way not to get wet is to not jump in the pool.

dcoekc7,pat_the_bat_316,"Who said anything about ""reds""? Putin is just as scary by himself as any ""reds"" were during the Cold War. And, yes, most the Trump-Russia evidence is circumstantial at this point, but you have to admit that there is a whole heck of a lot of it. You also have to admit: no other sitting US President has had this many personal ties to Russia in his inner circle/cabinet. That, in and of itself, seems fishy. Whether or not it amounts to anything... we shall see."
dcr6n7d,haha764,"> Putin is just as scary by himself as any ""reds"" were during the Cold War. Why?"
dcrdppc,pat_the_bat_316,"Because his goals for world domination (and thus our fear of him) don't involve nuclear war, which is less scary when you realize the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the resulting concept of mutually assured destruction make it a much less feasible strategy to succeed at, as opposed to Putin's politic-based plan for Russia to regain it's ""rightful"" place atop the world hierarchy."
dcoenif,Benjewlici0us97,"Not that I particularly give a shit, but hey I got time before my next class starts.>Born in Saint Petersburg, Putin studied German at Saint Petersburg High School 281, and speaks the language fluently.[4][5] He then studied law at the Saint Petersburg State University, graduating in 1975.[6] Putin was a KGB foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel before retiring in 1991 to enter politics in Saint Petersburg.Literally a former KGB agent. That's like saying there are no democrats in Massachusetts. Edit: Just in case you want me to source it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin"
dcr6m18,haha764,"He worked for his government before communism fell, how is that evidence that Putin is currently a communist? By that logic, Pope Benedict is still a nazi because he lived in Germany and joined the Hitler youth during WWII."
dcr7acg,Benjewlici0us97,"Working off your nazi connection if someone had been a high ranking SS officer prior to the fall of nazi Germany, many people would still refer to them as a nazi. I doubt put in was ever truly a communist at all but he did work for the kgb for almost two decades. To say that there are none left from the ""red"" days is untruthful at best."
dcr8diy,haha764,It depends on what they did and how ideological they were really. Plenty of high ranking officials in Nazi Germany moved to the US and other countries after the war and weren't treated like enemies for the rest of their lives. I think this concern about connection to communism is disingenuous at best because I didn't see anyone on the left concerned about Bernie Sanders having a Soviet Union flag hanging in his office in the 80s.
dcr99xz,Benjewlici0us97,Well we do know what he did. He was a lieutenant colonel in the KGB which is altogether different from hanging a hammer and sickle in your window. The KGB were not exactly angels...
dcr9fav,haha764,My argument wasn't against him being in the KGB though. I don't dispute that. I'm talking about personal ideologies ITT
dcr9pgx,Benjewlici0us97,"The problem with that is that neither of the two of us can really know how he thinks, meaning that we don't know what his ideologies really are. We only truly know that he was a high ranking member of the KGB. If bernie sanders had been in the KGB then I'm sure people on both sides of the aisle would have issues with it as well, and furthermore I believe a comparison between Putin and Sanders in pretty much any way is a little bit of a stretch."
dcoieyj,nostalgichero,"Its not a red scare idiot. Russia isnt a communist nation. It is just one aggressive nation trying to establish an influence of power and tear down old treaties.

dcp702q,penpointaccuracy,"So what happens if you're wrong? At what point will you accept conclusions Donald collaborated with foreign interests to get elected? In order to have a solid foundation for an argument, it's important to know what your threshold will be to throw your hands up and say ""Welp! My opinion wasn't right here."" Would it be a smoking gun scenario like Trump on video taking a briefcase full of money from a Russian operative while strippers pee on him? Or could it theoretically be a smaller burden of proof to dissuade you from allegiance to Trump?I'm not suggesting any of the allegations are true mind you. That's what investigations are for: to see if any wrongdoing was committed and collect evidence to support or deny allegations. But I'm growing concerned about the inability for citizens of the US to discern information and accept conclusions that run counter to their biases.tl;dr: What would it take to make you lose faith in Trump?"
dcr6fua,haha764,"A more important question would be ""what would it take for you to care if Trump collaborated with Russia"". If he did, I don't care. I'd prefer them to be a US ally over our military shooting down their planes like Hillary promised. I'd rather not get drafted to fight in WWIII. I might be more bothered with the weak allegations of Trump collaborating with Russia if anyone on the other side gave a shit about Hillary taking multi million dollar donations from the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Even if Trump is a full blown Russian agent paid by the Kremlin he's still better than the alternative. He's still better than 8 more years of nobody on the left criticizing the president because of her gender, just like they did for Obama because of his race."

James Mitchel, a terrorist interrogator has spoken with many terrorists from Al Qaeda and ISIS and their plan is to infiltrate our countries, out bread us, make the mainstream media and political correctness work in their favor, and slaughter us (when the time is right). Look whats happening in Europe right now, its strikingly similar. Trump wants to keep Islam out due to this, Hillary wanted to raise the refugee importation 550% when ISIS already brags about infiltrating the refugees and using them to get in our countries. Trump may be a tool to recruite, but NOBODY is going to kill because of Trump, they need to be hardcore brainwashed from the start. Your argument sucks and so do liberals.http://adamcarolla.com/grant-imahara-and-james-mitchell/But i suppose YOU know better than an expert on what ISIS master plan is, because you are all knowing and anything else is racist"

When you've got a whole bunch of money, or you're in a position of influence, a lot of women in the real world interpret what ""sexual assault"" is a lot differently. The same action that famous musicians, athletes, and rich people like trump would brag about doing is something that would get a layperson accused of sexual assault. Take trump and your feelings for him out of this. This is definitely something you could imagine a famous actor, athlete, or musician saying (because they do). Because it's true. Women throw themselves at rich and famous people. Not all women, of course - but a **lot** of them.

dcoj1i7,Garbungy,"Sexual assault or that women LET him grab them by the pussy. If your girlfriend/boyfriend let you have sex with them, is that sexual assault or is that compliance? Just wondering where you draw the line. Because he's someone you don't like or because you legitimately believe that?"
dcok1ot,lord_balathustrius,"1. ""Grabbing any woman by the pussy"" without explicit or implied prior consent is sexual assault. Full stop. 2. Do you have any actual response to how people are upset that our new President advocated for such actions or not?"
dcoknpw,Garbungy,If it was not consensual then why have they not pressed charges. That a chargeable offense. You don't know whether or not there was consent. I would say there was since nobody has come forward about the event.
dcoldzb,lord_balathustrius,By his own admission what he said is non-consensual. Sexual assault victims are often reluctant to press charges. I imagine that is compounded when the guy is in a powerful. I doubt a victim would want to go through that.

I persuaded the Plaintiff to attend a series of parties of Mr. Epstein that took place during the summer of 1994. I told her that, if she would join me at the parties, she would be introduced to people who could get her into the modeling profession and she would be paid for attending. 7. It was at these series of parties that I personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were advised that she was 13 years old. 8. I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop."

dcoxmqm,npor,No one said rape. No one's talking about rape. Were talking about sexual assault. And I can prove it. There's audio of him fucking admitting it. Unbelievable how stupid you are.
dcozfy6,Zepplin01,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. This is how incompetent the American left is. Unbelievable. If you actually listened to the Trump tape and/or it's transcript. There is **NO WHERE** in the tape where Trump even talks about Sexual assault. When talking about the woman mentioned in the tape, Trump actually talked about consent. And how he was making moves on the woman but unable to get sex.> I moved on her, actually. You know, she was down on Palm Beach. I moved on her, and I failed. I'll admit it.Where is any sexual assault there? He clearly said he was trying to move on her, and he failed. Nothing abnormal. I've done the same with women at times where I moved on them and failed. You probably have, assuming you're a straight male. And in regards to the grab em by the pussy part, If you look at the full context, Trump was talking about how women *allowed* him to grab them by the pussy *as an example* because he was rich and famous (not that he actually did it, but he used grab em by the pussy as an example). Here's the full context.> Trump: Yeah, that's her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.> Bush: Whatever you want.> Trump: Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.Now that you've seen the context, you can clearly see that this was *not* an admission to sexual assault, he was rather explaining how he can get women to do sexual acts with him/for him easily because he's rich and famous. Or just bragging. He might have been lying and not done any of that just to seem masculine. Guys do that a lot, too. ###GOOD DAY!No really, I mean it. Because you need to get un-brainwashed. You are listening to leftist talking points without any actual evidence. Take this as an important life lesson not to trust everything the MSM tells you. Do research and find the truth. Feel free to criticize Trump. But calling him someone who commits acts of sexual assault because he was bragging about women on a bus to another straight man, you are essentially making yourself someone not to take seriously because of how uneducated you are. I understand the humiliation in admitting that you're wrong, but hopefully, after reading this comment, whether you admit or not that you're wrong, you do more research into what people claim."
dcp0hcc,npor,> I just start kissing them. I don't even wait. This is consent? Your move.

There is [zero evidence](http://www.cnn.com/2016/12/12/opinions/russia-role-shocking-but-not-hacked-douglas/)The DNC wasn't even hacked by Russians.

We reported the case and went to court, and my rapist's three year sentence was brought down to three years of probation. This feeling sometimes just feels like a pebble sitting in my stomach, and sometimes I can taste the acid in the back of my throat when I think too much about this. Hearing the language that Trump used in that tape and in his remarks regarding it, and the way people jumped to his defense made me feel retraumatized. I started to have flashbacks, panic attacks, nightmares. I felt like all the work that I have done in five years was undone in minutes. My mother voted for Trump. A woman who swore she wanted to kill the man who raped me voted for one who is similar. It is one of the hardest betrayals I have had to deal with in my life. I felt unprotected, I felt backstabbed, I felt powerless, I felt worthless. I do not understand how people could listen to that and vote for him. It really, truly breaks my heart. My rapist didn't go to prison, and now someone similar to him is my President. I just don't know if I can do this. EDIT: a word"

From the outside view, however, people see this, and their judgement is: No, that women did not consent per my rules of consent, therefore she did not consent.But even if we take away that aspect of it, and we simply do not know the consent of the person involved in this interaction, all across the nation people hear the description of the encounter, and they still make up their minds for the woman involved about whether or not she consented.

dcoe80w,abstrarie,"I tried to post this on something else in response to a Trump supporter that wanted ""real"" anti Trump arguments but the comment section got locked before I could send it, so here seems like a good place to drop it so all that typing doesn't go to complete waste:Outside of all the obvious narcissistic tendencies and inability to control himself when he sees a target to belittle for his own gain (both qualities which will make negotiations with foreign powers more... interesting is the word I will go with) I have to say the thing about him that I dislike the most is his boast of being a great business man and how he will do wonders for our economy. Besides there being a large difference between those who are experts in constructing/maintaining economic systems and those who are experts at participating in them (or in his case, maybe the more accurate term would be exploiting them), if you look at his business record you will see that he is only capable of one thing: enriching himself. He accomplishes this mainly by vowing to enrich everyone around him and making lofty promises just to get in the door and make a sale. Once that is done he always falls short and makes sure to do little more then get his piece of the pie and then get out. The claim that his multiple bankruptcies were ""good business"" is completely false. It might have been good business for HIM but certainly not for the majority of people that were affected by his ventures. He is a sales man that will say whatever it takes to enrich himself, and I believe his presidency was the best sales pitch he ever threw together and we bought it. Hopefully he doesn't run the presidency the same way that he runs his businesses, but I feel historical precedent is not in our favor on that."
dcoh27q,JLR-,"If he does that for the USA (gets a piece of the pie and gets out) and enriches America and leaves other countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia...etc holding the bag I won't complain. As far as his bankruptcies not being good business goes, those who were affected should know business is ruthless."
dcoioxz,abstrarie,"What I meant in that comparison was that he would enrich himself and leave the rest of us holding the bag (which strikes me as the more likely scenario compared to what you are proposing). And even if your scenario did occur, that would leave those other countries angry with us which could lead to a variety of ill effects from refusing to work with us in the future to them funding operations against us. Also, the idea that ""business is ruthless"" should only be true against your competitors, not against your partners within your organization (and even that idea is a bit overplayed. Competitors should also be respectful of each other. I'm firmly against ""take it all"" style capitalism). While tough decisions certainly need to be made in business, you get nowhere without allies in both business and politics. I feel like Trumps only allies are his immediate family (including his wife until she starts visibly sagging in the wrong place) and people that can make some residuals by hanging out with him while he loots his next target."
dcoixqt,JLR-,I don't care if Iran or the Saudis are upset. I guess we disagree on competitors should be respectful. I don't see much common ground with our opinions.
dcolpu7,abstrarie,"I would say the common ground is that we both want what is best for America. The core of my beliefs on that front is that the best way to keep yourself safe is to make sure the people around you don't want to hurt you. Friends (or at least acquaintances kept at arms length) are more beneficial to you then enemies. I try to practice that in my day to day interactions and with my politics too. Obviously you gotta tell people to fuck off sometimes, but usually you can work to an understanding that is mutually beneficial. Anyway, sorry for another wall of text on this shit, but I do appreciate the opportunity to have a civil convo with people who have different beliefs then me (even though it was mostly me just typing too much ha)"
dcp4j1z,JLR-,I also appreciate the civility. I don't believe in this day and age that most friends/allies can be trusted. I'm tired of America being taken advantage of. I agree we both want what's best for America. I think your ideas have merit but won't be effective in principle.

Women play hard to get on purpose -- it's like survival of the fittest -- to make sure the fittest mate is the one who mates with them. They don't want a man who gives up easily.Also, all of this crap about ""rape culture"" makes me laugh.

You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anythingYou can pretty easily put the lack of charges down to a feeling of futility, these women thought it was normal and suing very, very rich people is bound to failure.You are right, no-one has any business commenting on what consenting adults do to each other, UNLESS IT IS A CRIME (aka not consent) of which donald himself explicitly admits committing."
dcohceh,Lballz,"""They **let** you do it""Pretty much shoots that down. You can't equate someone saying that to actual sexual abuse. In fact you are trivializing the word by using it incorrectly."
dcohky0,redwolfy70,"since when does not resisting constitute consent? and im not saying they are the same thing, stuff like rape is much worse. We dont ignore normal assault as ""doing so trivialise murder""."
dcohw7l,Lballz,"If I go to kiss my girlfriend and she doesn't resist what would you consider that? In my opinion it's consensual. But we can't pretend that this comment is ""sexual assault"" or anything remotely close to it. If you go on a date with someone, and you lean in to kiss them and they don't resist then logically that is consensual."
dcoi6b9,Vertur,"So by your logic holding a gun up to someone and telling them to give you their wallet is consensual so long as they dont resist. Lol, please listen to what you're saying."
dcoj25i,Lballz,"Except for that is completely wrong. Having the gun pointed at you automatically equals a crime. If I walk up to you and say ""Can I have your wallet"" and you give it to me, that would in fact be consensual. The same way that someone accepting a sexual act is consensual. If you are going to tell me to listen to what I am saying at least try to respond with some logic."
dcoqq13,Vertur,"So touching a sleeping girl is consesual because she didn't say anything, right? How is trump being in a position of vastly superior social standing with the ability to ruin your life so different for a mugger with a gun? Your logic is so flawed it boggles my mind. You're literally arguing silence equals consent."
dcosuum,Lballz,"No one is saying anything about sleeping girls. You are building a straw man now. That is not my argument at all. If Trump said ""I can grab the pussies of sleeping people because they can't say no"" then yes I would agree, but you are legit just making stuff up now for comparisons. There's no point in continuing the discussion with someone who can't use basic logic."
dcot45d,Vertur,"How am I not using basic logic? I finished my reply with you're arguing silence equals consent. Is that genuinely hard for you to grasp? You argued you going home and kissing your girlfriend is the same thing as Trump groping a random woman with whom he has no connection. You're the one that cant use basic logic, dude. LOL."
dcoi8u5,redwolfy70,"In those two situations, yes it would be consensual, however there is a difference between kissing someone you know on a date and walking up to someone you happen to find attractive and kissing and groping them, yes they may enjoy it but, you really dont know that and forcing yourself on someone you dont know without consent is seriously pushing it."

dco9q99,FreshHotTakes,I listened to trump's audio myself. He is a predator. There is no way around that. This has nothing to do with the MSM. He is just a guy who likes to assault women.

Why do you think the guy got elected? People were dead tired of that all the time, every day. You're protected under law. Like anyone else. If you think you're being discriminated against then present that. Not imaginary rants of ""white men do this and white women co-opt our anger, and only this person may express an opinion because they are part of this marginalized group etc etc.""People lashed back on that by putting Trump in.

Get out of campaign mode and start actually trying to defend the crazy shit this guy comes out with instead of endlessly droning on about Hillary and Obama. They're gone now, you won't be able to brush off every criticism of Trump by saying Hillary would be worse. It's boring and gives away how hopeless your candidate is"
dcoqfw3,,"no shes not but shes the person who ran against trump and has a long history of protecting her womanizing husband for the sole purpose of protecting their political careers. people always like to comment ""how could anyone vote for a man like this"" the answer is his opponent had been protecting her womanizing husband for decades. this is the narrative you guys chose so dont be surprised when people defend their choices by pointing out the only alternative wasnt any better in this regard. think about it Trump won because many were convinced Hilary was as bad or worse. It might annoy you to hear it but it doesnt make it any less true. you wanna discreedit one canadite for sexual assault but wont do the same thing for another. I am sure you were pointing the shit Hilary and Bill had pulled at the same time you were arguing Trump was a piece of shit too right? lets not act like you did. you didnt so lets not pretend anyone here has some moral high ground. both canadites were sexual deviants and have done questionable things."
dcot28r,TheDeadMagnet,"How on earth do you know whether or not I've been critical of Hillary's defense of her husband? I happen to think that the accusations of rape and sexual assault levied against Bill are most likely true and that Hillary's decision to ignore this for her own political gain is disgraceful, especially when she claimed to be running on behalf of all women.However, this in no way changes how I feel about the accusations brought forth against Trump, which I believe are equally likely to be true. You accuse me of accusing one side of sexual assault without giving equal time to the other. I hope that the first part of this comment will prove to you that that is not true (although I do realise there are far too many on the left who do ignore the Clinton's and their relationship to sexual assault whilst constantly haranguing Trump supporters over similar allegations made against him). It is you in fact who criticize one side without treating the other with the same scorn. Unless you prove me wrong by replying that the allegations made against Trump, if true, are equally as disgusting and unsettling as the ones made against Clinton, then I fear you'll continue to answer any questions about Trump's past with all the Clinton accusations while never admitting that Trump is accused of the same thing and therefore not better or worse, but the same.And once again, she lost, she's gone, he hasn't been president for 17 years. Hillary Clinton is irrelevant (finally) and you can't continue to use her as a shield to guard against any and all criticism of Trump. It just doesn't hold up."
dcop9xi,fourthandthrown,Hillary Clinton isn't President?
dcoslxx,McGnarb3r,She protected a child molester. That's the difference. Trump is a rich and powerful man who is acting like any other Rap artist with record label. And the allegations from the leaked emails suggest that she may be covering for others who commit the same criminal acts.
dcotdvz,fourthandthrown,"Trump is also good friends with Epstein, and has been to Lolita Island. He has also had lawsuits alleging that he has raped minors, and his own ex-wife said that he raped her. Plus attestations of walking in on unclad minors, various gropings, his own tapes boasting that he 'doesn't even wait'...your defense boils down to 'he's acting out the worst traits of humanity, according to his own power and control, even though he was using that as a talking point about how different he was from the elites and politicians in the first place'. You are telling me that people voted for the person who directly resembled the worst of their venal sins and carnal impulses, rather than being one step removed (yes, damning with faint praise; I personally voted Bernie in the primaries). Any mud you try to splash on Hillary sticks just as well to Trump, especially since he's decided not to prosecute her. If what you say is true, he's protecting her in turn, making him no better. And, most importantly, SHE DIDN'T MAKE PRESIDENT. SHE IS GONE. KAPUT. THIS IS AN EX-CANDIDATE. The person currently in office is an alleged rapist, covers for other criminals by his own rhetoric and your beliefs, and embodies the devils rather than angels of our natures. He won the race, he gets to reap the whirlwind. You want people to support him, how about you start talking about the good things he does rather than how someone else WHO LOST stacks up? AND not in terms of how other people suck, easy as that is; do the heavy lifting of painting his strengths and successes, if you can."

For example, you will leave out the fact that he was talking about gold-digging women, not ALL women, and also that he said ""they **LET** you do it"" not ""you do it by force"" like all of you wishful thinkers started claiming.This is the mass disinformation you try to do. Lie and mislead people. 100% fake news. And now, you come to me saying he ""Committed"" sexual assault. Jesus, you are surely living in your own dreamworld, aren't you? You like more to live in a LIE so you won't face reality, accept you were wrong and move on with your life..."

Not at all.As far as the accusations go, anyone can come out and make any accusation about anyone.

dco6kjg,totallyclips,"You're right, he just said that's what he did"
dco77fw,shrimpossible,"I grab my wife's pussy, and she likes it. The whole supposed sexual assault admission meme came about when Anderson Cooper mentioned elements of a sexual assault charge, then asked Trump, in a debate, whether he hasn't assaulted women, to which he said no. Some commentators further muddled the issues with discussions of implied consent.As a defense lawyer, I can tell you that I'd get Trump off 100% of the time on sexual assault charges, if the only evidence were that tape. The main reason is that he never said he engaged in sexual touching without consent (though he did say he kissed women without ""even wait[ing]"", keeping in mind that a kiss can also be a greeting).FWIW I didn't vote for him, but the facts are the facts."
dco7dxu,PuffPuff74,"> I grab my wife's pussy, and she likes itTry it with your coworkers, they'll love it :)That said, I know there's no ground for legal accusation here."

dco79my,swohio,"I made a similar comparison to a rock star saying groupies would let him do anything he wanted to them. The response was ""that's absurd, he isn't a rock star."" Oh yeah, wealth and fame don't mean anything. He's dated several supermodels just because they liked his hair..."
dco7bfq,NotFooledbyFools,"Since we're all about getting the actual quote right can you point out where he said ""groupies"" when he bragged about grabbing pussies and getting away with it?Thanks."
dcoal09,xatencio000,"I didn't put groupies in quotes. You did. I'm paraphrasing what he actually said for brevity. Here is what he actually said:>""And when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.""He's clearly describing textbook groupie behavior. If Chris Hemsworth had said this, everybody would be laughing at what he was obviously referring to."
dcocthz,NotFooledbyFools,"So you're *paraphrasing* an actual quote. Nice. FYI: Hemsworth didn't say it and no, everybody wouldn't be laughing, only sick fucks that justify sexual assault would."
dcoe2xu,xatencio000,"What do you think ""they let you do it"" means?"
dcoe6uj,NotFooledbyFools,I think it means Trump thinks he can do it because he's famous. Keep defending a rapist.
dcoh749,xatencio000,"So you don't think groupies are a thing that actually exists? And people on your side of the aisle should pull your rhetoric back in. Trump may well have an actual scandal someday but nobody's going to believe it because you've been making every accusation at him 24/7. If he's not a rapist, don't call him a rapist. He's never even been charged with rape let alone proven guilty to rape. You're doing an incredible disservice to the public by hurling these impotent accusations at him."
dcohr0e,NotFooledbyFools,I'm hurling accusations? Correct me if I'm wrong but over a dozen women (not groupies) claimed he sexually assaulted them to include one that had a lawsuit previous to the tape airing. Herr Trump can do no wrong in the eyes of his sheep.
dcoj2ad,xatencio000,">Correct me if I'm wrong but over a dozen women (not groupies) claimed he sexually assaulted them to include one that had a lawsuit previous to the tape airing.Correct me if I'm wrong, but when has Trump ever even been *charged* with rape let alone convicted. If you call somebody a rapist, shouldn't the burden of proof be on you? And where is your proof that Trump is a rapist? Do you have *any* facts to back up such an assertion?You calling Trump a rapist would be like me calling Bill Clinton a rapist. Would you ever call Clinton a rapist based on the numerous accusations of women who have accused him of rape?"
dcojmrp,NotFooledbyFools,> And where is your proof that Trump is a rapist? Access Hollywood video. Self admitted.
dcokqgx,xatencio000,Stop lying to yourself and to the public. It's beyond pathetic. Claiming that *some* women will actually let you grab their private parts isn't an admission of rape. You would be laughed out of court if you tried to present it as evidence.Do you have any other facts on your side? Because they seem to all be on my side. Weird.
dco78yf,PuffPuff74,I forgot that Donnie isn't a celebrity. He's probably said that from other people's experience. /s
dco864z,NeilOld,"And sweet and innocent (and humble!) as he is, Trump certainly doesn't consider himself a celebrity. Right?"
dco6im2,barakvesh,"Amazingly, people usually won't call themselves rapists. But if you phrase it another way, like asking if they kept going after getting a ""no"", they will admit to it"
dco787g,CapnSpazz,"Similar to when someone hits their partner. They didn't want to do it, the person made them. If that person didn't mess up, they wouldn't have to beat them. Or even recently with racism. They're not racist, their race realists or some shit.It's all just wording it differently to make it sound better."
dco7l1q,Inactivated,Trump is on video saying exactly that.
dco7tsg,,[deleted]
dco9bz9,Inactivated,At best he at least admitted to kissing women without their consent. He said I don't even ask I just start kissing. This too is sexual assault.
dcobcyr,,[deleted]
dcobldo,Inactivated,Think what you want but it's pretty obvious to me that Trump likes to grope women and expects them not to complain because they would be fired if they do so.

dcobn06,DTLAfacts,"look up the meaning of ""relevant"" in the dictionary.it's extremely relevant. His low approval rating is also relevant."
dcoca0d,cel_ad0r,"Maybe irrelevant is too loose of a term... I should have used 'inconsequential'.Its relevant in that it helps dems feel better about losing the presidency, the Senate, the house of representatives, the majority of state governorships, the majority of state legislatures, and soon the Supreme Court for a generation... 2018 not looking good for them either ;)"

Same with conversations with good friends before job interviews. People talk like that as a way to try to calm themselves down.Stop giving liberals a bad name by being baseless whiners.

We're on the brink of a revolution, and Hillary wasn't the person to bring that about."

In some jurisdictions simply putting a person in fear of bodily harm can be considered assault. You can be arrested, indicted, and lose in court by simply shoving a person or touching them when they tell you they do not want you to do so.

If you see uncivil comments, please report them and do not reply with incivility of your own.**I get it, it's a ""civilized"" world we live in. But you have to look at how power is acquired. Not given, not gifted, not awarded. Taken, Seized, Grabbed. These are not peaceful words. Power is not something that is granted to anyone, it's something that is taken via force. Through the imposition of ones will upon another.Sexual Assault. It's not a very intimidating phrase is it? Because you don't want oppressed people to have access to intimidating language. Rape got too complicated to use, and it started to include to many things. And it's such a hard word, and it makes it difficult to see the VIOLENT FUCKER who committed it as anything less than a VIOLENT FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT. So instead of that ugly word Rape, lets use Sexual Assault for all but the most heinous of actions. And instead of Rapist, lets use Offender. In fact lets label it as a SEXUAL OFFENSE, that's right up there with sounding as bad as a TRAFFIC VIOLATION. Shit, that language still might be too rough, maybe we can call it an UNWANTED SEXUAL ADVANCE.The problem is words don't exist that describe how bad it is. Because those who are willing to impose their will on others will work tirelessly to discredit and erode the meaning of any words used that may give power to those whom they oppress.So I propose a new vernacular. From now on when you would use any word to describe any kind of Sexual Assault, or Sexual Offense... use the phrase HATEFUCK instead. And when describing the person who would do such a thing, they should be called a HATEFUCKER. And under no circumstances, under no cloud of censorship should you be concede to anything less than using the most ugly, despicable language possible.Because you will be asked to ""Be Civil"". FUCK CIVILITY. Anyone who wants to see HATEFUCKING as civil is not an ALLY they are an ENEMY. They are not concerned with your best interests. They are not your friend. THEY ARE ASKING FOR YOUR SURRENDER.CIVILITY : 1.) Formal politeness and courtesy in behavior or speech2.) Polite remarks used in formal conversationAnyone who wants to talk about one person HATEFUCKING another person stripping away all of their DIGNITY and trying to destroy them in the most gruesome way possible in a CIVIL manner has no desire to change anything. They want to suppress, they want to avoid, they want to escape the problem.Do not let this happen. These people are trying to hold you down. They want you to remain weak. They want you to feel as if you CAN NOT FIGHT BACK. They use VIOLENCE against you, and seek to limit your ability to use it in return.GIVE NO QUARTER, MAKE NO CONCESSIONS, FIGHT NOW FOR YOUR LIFE. Don't trade your life for civility."

dcox2xr,chernoblechild,"Do You Know Someone Suffering From Trump Unacceptance & Resistance Disorder (TURD)?TURD is a pattern of pathologically dissociative and psychotic behavior, first observed in the late hours of November 8th 2016, and increasing in severity with passing time.Sufferers of TURD often exhibit pronounced cognitive dissonance, sudden bouts of rage, rioting, and uncontrollable crying.People with TURD are characterized by a persistent unwillingness to accept that Donald Trump is going to Make America Great Again.TURD Is caused by the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States of America. For many, both in America and worldwide, this was a shocking and unexpected outcome; their preferred news sources having failed to inform them that the alternative candidate was a criminal parasite.Research is ongoing, but TURD appears to correlate closely with some of the following environmental and behavioral factors:* Membership in the Democratic Party* Identifying as a Feminist* Currently enrolled in college, and/or Possession of a Liberal Arts college degree* Living in a densely populated metropolitan area* Massive student debt* Spotty or non-existent work historyPatients with TURD are very resistant to treatment, and dangerous in large groups. Any possibility of treatment requires that they be separated from their hive-mind support apparatus; they cannot begin the process of accepting reality in the presence of encouragement towards delusion and irrationality. Separation may require the assistance of law enforcement.If you have a friend or loved one suffering from TURD, urge them to seek treatment. Together we can beat this scourge, and Make America Great Again.I really don't think treatment is possible only time may heal. Of course if they exhibit violent tendencies report to the police as possible terrorists."

dco7qen,Gustacho,"It's an expression. It's pretty crude, but some people like to say it. I personally don't think it's tasteful, but whatever, First Amendment. But Trump *actually* grabbed someone by the genitals. Actions speak louder than words. Sexual harassment is not ok."

dco7q4t,FatMaul,"No question some people are but in this specific case, you don't think this woman's opinion is valid? Sure, he did apologize but candidates have been sunk by so much less in the past. People aren't bitter and petulant because a republican is going to be POTUS, they're bitter because they think he's a horrible man and a terrible example for someone who is going to represent the people of this country as the leader of the free world. It really isn't that political, it's his character. Anyone else who ran for the Republican candidacy would have been way more acceptable. Politically we may not like their conservative views but for him, it's who he is as a person."
dco83w1,sesquipedalienator,">People aren't bitter and petulant because a republican is going to be POTUS, they're bitter because they think he's a horrible man and a terrible example for someone who is going to represent the people of this country as the leader of the free world.This is an ad hominem attack which is unsubstantiated. If you're going to put the man's flaws up on a **projector**, you are REQUIRED to put his good deeds up as well. That is something you NEVER see from the left. Trump has done so many good things for so many people, all of which is well documented. You take the good with the bad, and you judge the policy, not the man proposing it.Another reason that ad hominem is fallacious is because none of you are fit to judge. I would love to see all of your worst moments put up on a **projector** for the world to see. Do you think, for one moment, that those moments define what kind of person you are? If not, step down off your high horse and STOP JUDGING THE MAN BEFORE HE'S EVEN LEFT THE STARTING GATE. It just makes you look as ignorant and bigoted as you're accusing Trump of being. Its called, ironically, **PROJECTION**."
dco8h4s,,So... Which good deeds are those?
dco93ln,sesquipedalienator,"There is such a thing as Google, and the will to look beyond your confirmation bias. Anyone who wants the nurse to put the red pill in their mouth and massage their throat until they swallow needs to seriously question their desire for the truth. But, I digress. Here's a list to help you get started. Even fake news Snopes can't debunk them, only spin the story and cry about it.http://regated.com/2016/05/great-things-trump-done/"
dco999x,,Its a shame he went off the rails in the mid 2000's then.
dcoe08n,FatMaul,"It wasn't an attack it was my opinion as to why people are so against him. I didn't say he was a horrible man. I said people think that and that's why there's so much turmoil. He won the election, while many are still in denial there isn't an overall belief that he didn't win or cheated or whatever. People will point fingers and blame fake news, Russian influence, sexism, racism or whatever as we saw after he won. The reason he won is he convinced more people in the right places that he was the better candidate. It's really that simple. I am just saying the people on the left feel he is the worst of all of the candidates by far and almost anyone else wouldn't have gotten this reaction."
dcoelbd,sesquipedalienator,"Then the charge of ad hominem and ignorance lays at their feet, and they should be duly ignored."
dcofzf2,FatMaul,"I think that we can agree there is plenty of ignorance going around on both sides and that there is so much that should be ignored but isn't. It's what happens in the world of 24 hours news channels, radio talk shows and endless blogs. People used to have to earn their voice but now there are endless small mountain tops to shout from."
dco85xd,Meg_Shark,"Why don't you leave? Sincere question. If I was somewhere I didn't enjoy--say, for example, an Adam Sandler movie (I don't like Adam Zandler)--I would leave. If I chose not to leave and it wasn't enjoyable for me then that would be my problem, right? Sometimes, I go over and read The_Donald. I don't comment or complain (well, mostly because no dissenting opinions are allowed). I just view the content *without downvoting*. Or, again, you could just leave and go somewhere else."
dco8lbd,sesquipedalienator,"**YOU JUST PROVED MY ORIGINAL POINT, AND CAN'T COMPREHEND IT BECAUSE IT IS TRUE.**Whats the matter? Am I sullying your echo chamber? Have I trampled on your confirmation bias? Free speech is *unpopular speech*. Leftists despise the very concept because they dare not hear anything outside their status quo. Leftists laud free speech, by defining it as speech which conforms to their narrative. Anything else they 'otherize' as hate speech. The Constitution is a 'living document' to leftists, so that they can interpret it to support their narrative. The idea of it being objective and absolute appalls them, because they are moral relativists. **Only intellectual cowards fear hearing dissent.** u/Spez has proved that beyond the shade of a doubt. He is the definition of an intellectual coward. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why r/all is one being giant leftist circlejerk."

See a psychologist, people. Your bitterness makes you so marginalized that by the midterms you're going to see a SUPERMAJORITY. Ignore that at your peril."
dco7uzz,ShiningConcepts,"Actually, I *want* them to be butthurt and in pain.

dco8q77,ShiningConcepts,"Perhaps there's some misunderstanding here. I am not a Trumpeteer. I think the next 4 years are going to be terrible; but given this, I believe that it is better than nothing to have some entertainment value to salvage it. And I don't care what our society thinks about me for this, but seeing people get and act so butthurt is very entertaining, reality show-esque drama to me.I'm not saying this out of malice or hatred."

She was married… I moved on her like a bitch"" If you actually read this quote I've just pasted directly from the transcript of the tape you will see it is a clear admission of him making a sexually motivated advance against a married woman. ""I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss.""Once again, here he is not saying that he could kiss random women if he wanted to, he is clearly stating that this is something he does, and apparently quite regularly since he says them, not her.""You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.” While this isn't him directly stating that he has grabbed a woman by her vagina, it still shows clearly how he thinks about women. To him, they are objects of sexual power that he has a right and privilege to fondle and abuse. You should also notice that at no point during the conversation does Trump clarify that these are hypothetical scenarios or that he had consent when he done them. I don't know for a fact whether or not Trump actually done the things he said, or if he was simply trying to boast in private to a z-list celebrity radio DJ about how he can do whatever he wants with women, but either way this seems to me a very frightening insight into the mentality of the president."

dcoj6ze,g-j-a,"Just as a reference, this was years ago.I seriously doubt since he has Melania to bang he will look elsewhere.Think about it. You have caviar and prime rib at home. Why would you bother trolling for an order of McDonalds?"
dcokiuf,,You're missing the point.It is a testament to his character or rather lack of character. It also shows what his prevailing attitude to towards women is.
dcolxlp,g-j-a,"I didn't miss the pointThat house you're throwing stones from seems to have a lot of glass, old boy. And there are a LOT of men and women living in it.Locker-room talk is rarely a ""testament to character"".If we punished everyone that has ever made comments like this it would be unreal."
dcohqp2,wwlink1,"No you're literally living in the past of something he said in the past. Can't handle your decanter then stop deflecting. Stop being a hypocrite bandwagon jumper. How about hope your new president has all the success in making your country better, like any sane person would."
dcok681,dogpotato32,"Every bad thing people say about Trump is true. And yet, despite outspending Trump 10 to 1, Hillary still lost in an electoral landslide. Thanks for conspiring against Bernie Sanders, DNC. Enjoy the fruits if your labor."
dcoloqb,___DAE___,...landslide? Really?
dcols7p,babysealstomper,What straight man hasn't said anything IikeThis at one point in their lives !?!?!?? Give me a break people!!!!
dcon3ay,,"Contrary to popular belief, there are not ""two kinds of people"" in the world. Fact: there are straight men who were raised by other straight men to understand body autonomy and why it's important for society to function."
dcoryrb,TheSawceBawss,"I'm not one to grab pussies but if you listen to what he said, he says that they allow him to grab their pussies. Just saying."
dcosax0,astro_eng,"Common sense doesnt go with this sub, just sayin"
dcotj5p,LordSinc,"Title need's more accurate description: Man says things men say, Later Inaugurated as 45th etc..."
dcp0qsd,fehMcxUP,TIL consensual sexual stories are literally sexual assaultunimpressive liberal tripe
dcp3d4n,Sumisumisumi,"Umm...Guy saying ""she wanted it, yo"" =/= consensual sex Just FYI and to hopefully keep you out of prison a bit longer."
dcp3x48,fehMcxUP,"sorry the truth trigs you (I'm not)that's exactly what consensual sex is, not my fault your brain is brokenunimpressive liberal tripe lolyou're disingenuous feigning disgust for e-points and trying to shut down the woke with idiotic ""third-party rape accusations"" like they mean something, like you somehow deserve the attention you're getting. BTW, any notice you get from this is from people wondering how stupid you are, they aren't falling for anything dumb cuntbag."
dcpbim0,Human_Captcha,"So in this dynamic, You think you're part of ""The woke""?"
dco82f6,Zukb6,Get over it.
dcob8t0,sublime1123,"Man rapes many women, wife covers it up, later innagurated 42nd president"
dcobw03,pee_pee_tape,Sheesh - what ever *did* happen to that guy?
dcobzke,sublime1123,"He started a charity with his wife to enrich himself and allow people to give them money for favors when his wife became president. Then his wife stunningly lost, the donations dried up, and the charity is on the verge of shutting down"
dcod54k,pee_pee_tape,"Yeah, yeah - whatever happened to Bill Clinton after that?"
dcodnn2,sublime1123,He hid cigars in vaginas all over the world
dcoer1u,zaturama016,Well deserved for the people that supported hillfuck
dcofjto,agent0731,"but we didn't *see* him do it, so we can ignore that. There's far more important issues than whether or not your president is a sexual offender, god!"
dcohdov,joedaddy707,"Yes because fucking groupies, that will let you do pretty much anything you want, equates to sexual assault. Maybe we should start talking about all of the musicians that have sexually assaulted people over the years. There's a big difference between saying someone will LET you grab them, as opposed to saying you just walk up and grab them. If only people were this upset about Hillary rigging the primaries against Bernie, who rightfully should be being inaugurated right now. Funny how all of a sudden her Global initiative is shutting down now that she has no more governmental powers to give favors for cash.Edit: you mean that somebody with money and that's well known was bragging about having groupies? Off With His Head."
dcoi40j,Sunbob_Jim,Blessed be to God that a RAPIST did not reenter the white house. Thank God a corrupt racist career criminal who wants WAR with a nuclear country is not the leader of the free world. Thank God America is STRONG today and will PROSPER.
dcoma8f,OriginZero,"Exactly, that's what I've been saying since this came out. But people want to jump over it and call it out as sexual assault. The problem is that isn't what he said, so you can say it until you're blue in your face (not you but people that say it I mean) and it only hurts your case. The only people that agree and pat you on your back are the ones in the same bubble. People need to stop that shit if they want to be taken seriously. If you go around like that, it just weakens your case for the people you're trying to point out actual issues with."
dcomkel,,Do you understand what body autonomy is and why it's important?
dcomq16,Ed98208,"They quote him exactly in the article, it was on tape. What do you mean ""that isn't what he said""?"
dcq56g7,OriginZero,Where in the quote does he say he did anything without consent?
dcotylt,qwertycash,"Written by a woman, no surprise"
dco7jyh,Gobhoblin47,"Get ready for a great 8 years, snowflakes!"
dco8758,HealthyDebtlover,"""8"""
dco85ee,theplatypusmaster,says a member of a sub that bans dissent
dco92mo,Gobhoblin47,"It's a fanboy sub, you would get banned by saying ""fuck Nintendo "" in a Nintendo subreddit"
dco9zdh,hashtagrealtroll,B.S. headline. He never actually sexually assaulted anybody.
dcohf6c,SpiffyMcAwesome,"May want to read the title again. There's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8U0IaMsRf4) of him boasting of it, whether he actually assaulted people or not is not contained in that headline."
dcoafb5,,"When was this, if it is the grab by pussy comment, then you guys seriously are delusional and don't understand why this is one of the very reasons why you guys lost. He never boasted about sexual assault, he never said he forces to grab them by the pussy against their will and without consent... He literally says ""they let"" him... You guys need to get a grip"
dcoamn1,Cragvis,"So saying that parents 'let him' grope little children, would that make it ok to do that, let alone say that?"
dcoeo8i,,"""Man eats dog, later inaugurated 44th President of U.S."""
dcom8c0,HingleMcCringle_,What?
dcoms6n,,"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/obama-as-a-boy-ate-dog-meat/Just thought that the headline's attempting to portray correlation as causation was magnificently stupid, so I thought I'd flip it and see how it was received. Now we know."
dcot0ou,HingleMcCringle_,"I love dogs (my 16 y/o golden Retriever has 3 paws in the grave) but I can understand dog meat as a delicacy. In fact, I'd like to try it someday when I'm over seas. Highlighting that Obama ate dog meat shows to me how few scandals he's had."
dcoh5na,Fobwalton,I'm just glad the White House is white again
dcom7tk,HingleMcCringle_,What does that even mean?
dcokr9o,Moleculartony,I was going to say Clinton but then I noticed the 45

dcoq50d,mutatron,"No, Hillary isn't worse than Donald. Some people believe that because of two decades of smear campaigns though. Repeat a lie often enough and people will eventually believe it."
dcotkhr,,[deleted]
dcouos5,mutatron,Because it's not? What does that even mean? Looks like your logic is suffering from false equivalence and unfounded assumption of balance.
dco81kg,osskjc,LOL stay salty my friends
dcoab6u,Daily_Fun_365,"Man STILL hasn't released Occidental college records, was president for eight years."
dcoaz2h,DTLAfacts,what the fuck? Where are Donald Trumps records? Where are his tax returns?
dcob4dn,Daily_Fun_365,Sure he should release tax records but they wouldn't show he isn't an American citizen. Not the same equivalence.
dcob67a,DTLAfacts,okay I cannot engage with crazy people on reddit.you need to get a reality check.
dco83e5,thepowerisyours,Hey fellas let's leave the salt for another day this is our day. MAGA
