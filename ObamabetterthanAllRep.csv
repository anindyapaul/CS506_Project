c5ucomq,souv,"What an insightful post. Thanks TexDen, you clearly know a lot about politics."
c5uj8ji,TexDen,"Just thought I would throw that out there, didn't know it would hit a nerve."
c5v36lz,PoliticalHivemind,SO BRAVE.
c5uccuz,HALLZY69,"Is this really what /r/politics is? Someone posts some idiotic statement, with no evidence, and gets front page? Really?"
c5ucen8,Outlulz,"As long as it's pro-Democrat and anti-Republican it usually makes the front page, yes."
c5udn5v,tregea,"I know right? i more of lefty myself but all this republican ""bashing"" is taking up way too much of reddit"
c5uflkg,Bake-me,both parties suck end of story
c5ulhtn,Duthos,"That's the end of their stories, but it might be the beginning of johnson's."
c5udzsz,Traithan,"Well, when one party has polarized itself so badly that they would sooner see us default on our debts, have its people die of preventable medical issues, and continually use a propaganda machine to lie to the many unfortunately uneducated citizens of the country (Note that they want to keep them uneducated, Republicans across the board continue to defund any meaningful education bills) then yes, they deserve all the bashing they can get.I like my country, and I want to stay in it. If the extremist conservatives take control of the Executive and Legislative branches again, I would be forced to leave."
c5ueffc,TonyCheeseSteak,"Let me start with this statement. > Note that they want to keep them uneducated, Republicans across the board continue to defund any meaningful education bills)So in your opinion we need to spend more money on education. That is a fair enough opinion but may I ask what you suggest we throw that money at? Give me some ideas because since the 1970s our education spending has drastically raised while test scores have not. [Here is a graph showing the increases](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_otfwl2zc6Qc/SqgYwPKlGCI/AAAAAAAALSA/XJI3BUM5Mn8/s400/cato.jpg) It certainly seems to me that throwing more and more money at education hasn't done much to help, but if you think it will please supply actual solutions rather then just bash another party. Furthermore, the last Republican president (the party you say cuts spending to education) increased student financial aid by 20$ billion. Funding for elementary and secondary education increased by $5.1 billion. funding for state special education grants under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act grew by $4.6 billion, all Bush's doing. Most of which I disagreed with but you should know your facts before you make false statements. > Well, when one party has polarized itself so badly that they would sooner see us default on our debtsAs far as default on our debts, please inform me on something EITHER party has done to attempt to prevent this? I would love to hear it since it seems all each party can do is spend more and cut nothing so I would certainly be interested how you think the left is fixing this problem. Edit: I am trying to get to as many replies as possible but I am not home nor will be for a few days so I've been trying to reply as much as I can with the little bit of time I'm getting on a computer. So it will take a few days probably but I will try to get to everyone with a good as a reply as I can. Appreciate the replies and always enjoy some nice civil discourse."
c5ufg3h,chono,"On that note, it has been pointed out that with ""everyone"" getting an education, of course the average will plummet. Individuals who simply can't function well in an academic atmosphere. Some are just meant for labor jobs, and that's great.Honestly if everyone went to school and got great scores to drive up averages, I don't know what would happen in the economy with so many prepared for service sector jobs and not skilled labor roles. It's just one of those unfortunate truths to a society."
c5uj48s,vvelox,"> Individuals who simply can't function well in an academic atmosphere. Some are just meant for labor jobs, and that's great.Not functioning well in a academic environment does not mean some one is going to be working a labor job. I personally hate all the pointless large and required homework that gets in the way of studying, so I said to fuckery with college and left to work in the unix field."
c5wms6b,chono,"Just getting to this now, but good on you for getting past it. The generality really is that those who don't excel in academics (structured uni, etc.) typically don't have the drive to pursue other avenues, and settle on where they land in those first years out of high school. Again, generalities."
c5uev6g,JoshuaFB,Its not always about the money. I don't know how but we need to reform the system so that it works better and doesn't just teach kids how to take standardized tests. Education also occurs at home. That is all.
c5uive2,juanchopancho,"Yes you do know how. Look at Finland, that is the model. For drugs look at Portugal."
c5v3p0r,BerateBirthers,Eliminate grades. Let students come to *learn* not *to be taught*
c5uhvj2,grande_hohner,Home schooling for everyone!!!!
c5uk719,Panzergrenadier,we're dumb enough thank you.
c5uk89m,Hijoshikina,"Frankly, it's not about the money being poured into education. Our way to teacher students sucks, especially when we think about how our country is ran. You could beat children with gold bricks that is the education fund, but we live a place where war is more important than anything else. > Funding for elementary and secondary education increased by $5.1 billion. funding for state special education grants under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act grew by $4.6 billion, all Bush's doing. Most of which I disagreed with but you should know your facts before you make false statements.I find this really silly since when we speak of one topic we seem to ignore the defense budget which has been reaching all time highs. Not just in our country, but still."
c5urfs8,lovethismfincountry,the defense budget has nothing to do with his point. he was talking about all the spending we pour in to education with no results. whats your next r/politics talking point to counter his **facts**?
c5ursb4,Hijoshikina,"All I ask for is all the facts bro, nothing more."
c5uk3qf,,Test scores would probably be a lot higher if the dropout rate was similar to what it was in the 1950s.
c5urexk,lovethismfincountry,but instead we dumb down the curriculum so the stupid kids dont get butt-hurt.
c5ueqns,gynoceros,"Make kids perform up to certain standards or get left back. Parents will get kids' asses off of the xbox if they know it means an extra year of having junior live at home or, worse yet, being seen in public by another soccer mom who knows your kid couldn't hack 4th grade.The education money goes to re-educating those kids until they can read and write at grade level, pass a math test without a calculator, and correctly label a map, for starters. Add specific science requirements later on."
c5ufigh,namefaceguy,This is a silly statement. Reeks of no child left behind. We don't need teachers to be tough on kids to pass the test. That's what got us in the mess. As someone who came out of high school 7 years ago I know whats happened. Kids aren't stupid they will rebel when they know something doesn't make sense. What we need to do it make kids want to learn. We need to make school a reasonable enjoyable experience where kids aren't forced to be silent and obedient and where questions aren't met with hostility. More test are not the answer.
c5ufnwi,teacherdrama,"Bingo:>More test are not the answer.How about NO tests? None. How about we leave education to the people who have STUDIED to become teachers? How about we TRUST teachers to make decisions about their students? Tests SUCK. Tests are KILLING education. (I'm saying this as an educator for the past decade). We keep talking about how to test the kids, the tests will tell us! No, they don't. At their best, they are inaccurate and RIDICULOUS assessments of what the kids are learning. I keep hearing we're going to increase testing - I feel so bad for these kids who simply aren't LEARNING. Education is publicly funded so gets put into talking points by politicians, but politicians should stay the hell away from something they literally know nothing about."
c5ugnct,Oscar_Wilde_Ride,"I would do away with all standardized tests. I understand why administrators want tests and data, but they are doing more damage than they are worse. In medicine, you don't do a test if it is more harmful/more costly than what you want to cure. The same should be done in education."
c5ug06b,s0ck,"School is less about ""knowledge"", and more about learning how to think. How to solve problems. College is about knowledge, that's when you should be tested for retention of facts."
c5ug456,JustAnotherJon,"How do you propose we determine academic success? This is a ridiculous statement. I'm sorry but when folks enter the professional world, guess what they get evaluated on?Series 7, CPA, Law boards, MCAT, SAT, DAT, LSAT, ACT, MAT, OAT, PCAT, , VCAT, WTMA, TOEFL, NAPLEX, NAPLEX-RN, NAPLEX-PN, performance exams, Contractor's Test, GMAT, GRE, AP, CMA, chiropractic exams, and I could go on and on and on. The fact is when students enter the real world tests are essential. Sure they aren't perfect, but how else am I supposed to evaluate someone I don't know? I can't assume an individual is a good hire simply because they have a good interview. Tests aren't going anywhere. Teaching our kids how to test well teaches our kids SOME of the skills that are necessary to succeed in the world.People are evaluated on tests. The may not be perfect, but they are the most cost effective way to evaluate a potential job candidate."
c5ugdbp,teacherdrama,"I don't disagree with you - but you're talking about tests being given to 21+ year olds. That's VERY different from barraging 12 year olds with tests.Tests NEED to be given, of course, but standardized tests are disastrous in elementary/middle schools especially. Let kids just LEARN in those grades. Teachers can give tests for their subjects (this would require admins to release some power). You can start with standardized tests in high school - SATs and HSPTs or whatever. If you saw the tests my kids have to take, you'd change your mind. Questions are poorly worded. Articles are deadly dull and outdated (how this happens on tests that have had millions spent on them is beyond me), questions have more than one viable answer. I've seen typos, I've seen mistakes in directions - these tests are terrible. What's worse, they show NOTHING about what a kid learned during the year. If I teach a kid the joy of the humor of Shakespeare in Midsummer Night's Dream, is that tested? If I teach them to write a strong opening to a story by drawing the reader in - but they need to rewrite three times to get there - does that get tested? Testing below high school is detrimental to student learning. Want more proof? I got out of school before this nonsense started. Most of us over the age of 28 or so did. We got along just fine before all this testing nonsense started. Our kids are getting dumber. They are. I've seen the shift in the kids over the past decades - they're not as sharp as they were when I started teaching. Every teacher I know says this. What's changed? Testing."
c5ukm12,stopit,then fix the test if the questions are poorly written. you have to have standards across the country and the only way to assess them is with a test.
c5ukxnp,teacherdrama,"I maintain two things: 1)that's very limited thinking about educational policy, and 2)we have zero control over the test. The administration (re: the school board) decides on the test and buys it from an independent company (capitalism at its best). We are stuck with whatever test we get because the district has a contract to give out the test for x amount of years. Supposedly in two years we're changing tests - to one that tests four times a year. Brilliant, no? Additionally, why do we need standards across the country? What is effective for a student to learn in even one part of a state is different from what it might be elsewhere. A test that is given to the richest suburban districts and then given to those in the inner city is going to have vastly different results -- but it certainly doesn't show LEARNING happening. A kid can go from a third grade to a fifth grade reading level in a year, but if that kid is in seventh grade, all that learning means nothing - and the test will not show the advancement."
c5un2dx,stopit,"again, if the test are bad, lets find a away to get better ones. replace the administration if that is what it takes. capitalism has nothing to do with it, the fact you bring that up makes me think you are just trolling.your second statement is pretty racist. all kids should be expected to reach a standard. making excuses for minorities does nothing but harm. if you don't test, how do you measure advancement? ask the kid? ask the teacher? ask their parents?"
c5unkdx,teacherdrama,"I agree completely that we need to change the tests and change the administration. Testing has EVERYTHING to do with capitalism, and the fact that you don't understand that is WHY the tests will not change. It's ALL about the money. Believe me, I'm not trolling. I've been teaching for ten years.My second statement is not at all racist. And why should all kids be expected to reach a standard? 1)I never said a word about race - you read that into my comment. 2)People are born with individual talents. Some are geared towards school, some aren't. Similarly, some are musical, some are athletic, some are artistic. Some aren't. Why should all kids be forced to reach the same arbitrary standards? Some kids have developmental issues, or learning issues or any of dozens of other possibilities.How about measuring advancements of students by leaving it to the people who, again, trained for their jobs, have hundreds of hours of continuing education beyond school, and spend every day working with the kids? How about giving teachers the responsibility to deal with their students' advancements?In an ideal world, teachers would have that responsibility, tests would be long forgotten, and students would learn as was appropriate to their needs. Of course, all this would require a TON of money coming into education and a complete overhaul of the system. I don't see that happening any time soon."
c5uo42j,stopit,"we spend more money than the next 10 countries combined, more money is not the answer."
c5uoind,teacherdrama,A well thought out response.
c5uqv7s,JustAnotherJon,"Thats a relevant point as to the age of the test takers. When I went through grade school we took one standardized test at the end of the, but it didn't determine whether we passed/failed. It was just to make sure the private schools were up to par with the public ones.I'm 26 so I'm not sure if I got the rigorous testing that our current generation is receiving. Call me sick, but I've always looked forward to tests. It's a chance to compete against my peers and put my learning into action. I just don't see anyway that we can get good data without testing.Do you think that the dumbing down of our kids could possibly have more to do with the ""cool"" culture? It seems to me that often times certain segments of society just simply teach their kids not to care about education. They get it from the TV, movies, etc. I don't really understand this. In high school there were some of my friends that could most likely be stereotyped as ""rednecks"" and if the succeeded in school it was like they were betraying some strange sense of culture. However, when I was in a fraternity in college it was most definitely not cool to struggle with your grades.I feel like our culture plays a big part in the next generations attitude toward school work."
c5uqzxz,teacherdrama,"I do think that's part of it. The culture from movies, tv, and video games making stupidity a positive factor in life is just incredible. I knew the (so to speak) shit hit the fan when Jersey Shore became the most watched show by my 7th and 8th graders. How scary is it that 12 and 13 year olds biggest influence was Snooki and The Situation? The show reeked of stupidity and my kids ate it up.The scary thing is, I work in a pretty good middle class district. The problem, though, is that school (at least when I was going) was supposed to counter all that. Tv and entertainment in general is fine - you can laugh at idiocy - but when the school culture doesn't encourage intelligence what chance do the kids have? When we just pass them right along regardless of their scores, what motivation do they have to learn? When what little sense of placement they get comes from these ludicrous tests by a WIDE margin (teacher input is so minimal as to be farcical), why should kids unless motivated by their parents care? I can't tell you how many students I've had whose parents just can't be bothered, and so the kid fails. The whole system is terrible now. It really needs an overhaul, but like I said in another post, I just don't see it happening any time soon."
c5uhcty,Oddjob1313,"Quite frankly, I quit taking grade school seriously by the end of 9th grade because of how backwards it felt to me. I hadn't done work nor tried seriously in years, but by high school it all just seemed pointlessly stupid. The teachers either didn't know what they were talking about because tenure allowed outdated teachers to continue babbling on for years and years past their expiration date, while tests just forced us to regurgitate factoids of information back at the teacher with no real learning.To explain how pointless grade school has become, I left high school with barely a 2.0 GPA, went to a community college, got a 3.7, then got accepted into on of the top 40 best colleges in the country. And I literally didn't go to the second half of my senior year."
c5ulh8x,,For the most part your never taught how to apply any thing you learn.That seems kind of backwards to me.
c5uhxzc,aredditormaybe,"Well if you graduated 7 years ago, based on what you say, you must be 35 now, single, have no kids, and play WoW 24/7! Why should we let kids learn on terms that they accept based on their social life or own personal lack of discipline, thats what you are really saying right? While many kids don't succeed, there are many more that do, you may call them nerds or geeks, or maybe even young redditors. ""reeks of no child left behind?"" What is so terrible about that? Do you even know what it is, says, or stands for? Maybe if we didn't have such low standards for teachers, and even lower expectations of parents and community, then we wouldn't have drop out pukes like you posting on reddit!"
c5um2ip,namefaceguy,"Are you serious? how the fuck did you get 35 out of that? Even if for some reason you thought I was talking about college you would still be off by 6 years. I was talking about high school. I am 25 and lived through the no child left behind years. My school lost funding because it was a bad school. So they take the schools that are doing poorly and the solution is to take money away from them to ""punish"" them. Some kids had to sit on the floor and we were learning science from text books from the 60's. All because of this retarded let be tough on grades mentality. It's ignorant and dangerous."
c5ukhhm,gynoceros,"The teachers shouldn't be the ones hard on the kids, the parents should be.Our oldest was slacking off in school, and got a few Cs, which we knew wasn't his best work, so we had a talk with him, limited his video game and TV time, stopped taking his word that he'd done all of his homework, and by the end of 4th grade, he'd gotten 100% on his states and capitals, is second only to the Asian kid in math, and has vastly improved his creative writing.Over summer break, he gets to slack a lot, but he also has to spend at least 20 minutes a day reading.Parents being involved is the key. Some parents won't get involved unless they think their own status will be affected."
c5ulxhp,7Redacted,>That's what got us in the messYeah. Our education system was doing *splendid* before NCLB.
c5ug7if,fishmaster2012,"They have that. At my high school, If you didn't pass the end of course exam, you wouldn't get credit for the class, no matter what your grade was."
c5uizdj,Samueul,"You don't live in the real world of having kids, knowing people who have kids, and dealing with the public school system do you? Because if you did, you'd know that your statement is 100% full of shit."
c5ukdd6,gynoceros,"I like your assumptions. They're wrong, though."
c5ukjaa,Samueul,"""Parents will get kids' asses off of the xbox if they know it means an extra year of having junior live at home or, worse yet, being seen in public by another soccer mom who knows your kid couldn't hack 4th grade.""Assumptions? Sorry, but you must not know any parents."
c5unbvq,legion02,The scaling on that graph is horribly misleading. It also doesn't take into account the increase in difficulty of testing.
c5ufpff,despicable_secret,"I'm a libertarian, so public education gets no love from me. But one thing that sticks out to me is that, yes. We have increased funding with little change in test scores. But over that same time, we have also begun to educate people who previously didn't figure into the scores. The overwhelming majority of them come from groups that statistically test poorly.http://westhunt.wordpress.com/2012/05/29/educational-reform/"
c5uhlci,TonyCheeseSteak,"I agree with this, I was just trying to shed light on the falsities of the comment I was replying to. Also test scored vs many EU countries become skewed because they have a very different schooling system then us where many kids go into trade schools at I believe our age of high school."
c5ufqwj,xena_derpina,"Is this adjusted for inflation? Your whole post sounds like fluff to me. Student loans get paid back with interest, so they don't really cost the govt much. Ask any city or state board of education and they can tell you that education spending has been cut over the last 10 years. Also, our testing requirements have changed. Is everyone being graded on the same tests as they had 30 years ago? What about the fact that in the 70s, you could pay for college without loans working 20 minimum wage hours a week, because we taxed the wealthy to supplement tuition? And the gop is very extreme right now because moderates don't vote in primaries anymore. Obama is more like Reagan, and no way would Reagan even have a chance now. In Wisconsin, Reagan-like Tommy Thompson is getting panned for being too moderate. And according to fox news, moderate = liberal. 20 years ago, moderate = conservative."
c5ukgzj,spelczech,"Doing some rough math on that graph, it looks like education spending went up less than 3% a year. A lot of people wouldn't even consider that a cost of living raise, let alone actually improving education.I agree with a lot of people that the problem is less how much to spend and more how to spend it wisely and with the most affect."
c5unaoy,loondawg,">As far as default on our debts, please inform me on something EITHER party has done to attempt to prevent this?Obamacare. You know that 700 billion than Obama is supposedly cutting from Medicare? That's savings over the projected costs without Obamacare.And do you have more information on that chart? I'm curious what the possible range is on that second axis. Is it scaled to minimize the improvement it shows in math scores? And why does it only show until 2003 when it was from 2007 data and using 2008 dollars? etc...I ask because my public school teachers taught me to always question data since it is so easily manipulated."
c5uf2m9,rmmdjmdam,"Getting out of wars will seriously help us reduce the deficit - the military budget for 2004 was already at $399 billion while by 2009 it had reached $799 billion with the global war on terror directly accounting for nearly $200 billion of that. By comparison, non-military discretionary spending stayed flat at $383 billion during that period.Regarding avoiding defaulting on our debts? The US government is capable (as it showed this time last year) of raising the debt limit to prevent us from immediately defaulting on the debt. Regarding balancing the budget to pay off the debt, yes that's a different question. So which one are you referring to, because the Democrats were in favor of raising the debt limit last summer, while the Republicans did not agree until the 11th hour, which more than any other factor caused the downgrading of our credit rating."
c5uhmjk,TonyCheeseSteak,"I don't believe raising the debt ceiling is any sort of sane solution as it solved nothing in my opinion. As far as the downgrading of our credit rating I don't really see how how late we raised our ceiling played into that, at least not more then any other factor. I believe the biggest factor would be the fact that we can't control our debt, our debt is speedily rising, and we had to raise our debt ceiling as our only solution."
c5umkls,rmmdjmdam,"Not raising the debt ceiling would be akin to stopping payment on some of our debts - defaulting. That seems like a sane solution to you? The problem that you are describing (the debt and that's its increasing) cannot be fixed overnight or in a month, but over years, which means you need time to be able to fix it and thus deciding to not make payments on your loans as a stopgap solution is an utterly puzzling conclusion. Please correct me if I've mistook your view.Regarding raising the debt limit see [here](http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2011-08-05-s-and-p-downgrades-credit_n.htm) shows that S&P downgraded the AAA credit rating for several reasons including political gridlock regarding: entitlements spending and inability to agree to raise revenues. The lateness of raising the debt limit reinforced the lack of confidence that S&P had in the political gridlock. The US isn't Greece, we can raise substantially more revenue than they can by raising taxes, we control our currency and while our economy is struggling we are at 8% unemployment, not a depression like 25%.Also, you completely ignored my comment about military spending."
c5uo6b5,TonyCheeseSteak,"> Not raising the debt ceiling would be akin to stopping payment on some of our debts - defaulting. That seems like a sane solution to you?

Please correct me if I've mistook your view.Yes you are completely correct, it is not a problem that can be fixed overnight, but it is also a problem that did not come to be over night. Washington has known we were on this path for a long time yet did little to nothing to stop it and just kept spending and spending. I am not blaming any single party here as they have both helped get us to this point. The only recent president I can give SOME credit to would be Clinton who at least slowed the growth of government to be less then the growth of the private market which overtime would fix many problems. While raising the debt ceiling was necessary at the time I believe it is insane that it ever had to get to that point, and that many people view it as an actual solution, rather it is just a quickly peeling band-aid. > Also, you completely ignored my comment about military spending.I apologize for not addressing your comments on military spending, but I mostly agree big cuts can be made in forms of military spending. However at this point just sending everyone home is not easy and will still take years to accomplish. Cuts can be made in minimizing our presence overseas other then Iraq and Afghanistan. We have huge military bases all over the world, many times within a few hundred miles of each other. I don't believe that is necessary and I believe we could shut down and bring home at least half of those bases which would be a nice chunk of change we would be saving. If that were to happen though we have to be carefully to make sure the money saved is going to not just be spent somewhere else as if often the case. As for blaming the credit downgrade, I don't think you can really blame on party. If you want to blame republicans for not raising the debt ceiling fast enough then you could equally blame the democrats for not getting behind the republicans proposed cuts. This is a game you could play all day in the end you'll never win. Are we really surprised that the republicans and democrats are often in political gridlock? It doesn't take someone with a degree to figure that one out. Rather then blaming either side for the downgrade we should blame each for out of control spending, at least that is my opinion.Also I appreciate the good discourse and am looking forward to a reply."
c5uxkvq,rmmdjmdam,"Ah excellent - I did misunderstand your point of view. You're irritated that they got to the point where they needed to raise the debt ceiling, not that raising the debt ceiling itself is a bad idea - just bad that we got to that point. Okay - you and I see much more eye-to-eye than I originally thought, always a good thing to focus on.Yes - raising the debt ceiling was not a solution, it was a necessary patch that the federal government (Democrat and Republican) has done numerous times. In this instance the Democrats wanted to raise it again, while the Republicans used it as a political pawn to force discussing the deficit (not the most honorable thing, but understandable as a political move, though risky). I guess my problem with this is I don't understand why we are all of a sudden panicking about the debt - the deficit has been there for over a decade now that the last vestiges of the prosperity revenue levels and pre-Bush tax rates have passed and existed well into Clinton's first term, but all of a sudden with Obama in office, its the Republican issue in vogue, particularly given that they can't criticize the President for being weak on foreign policy.Looking at the raw numbers I do see massive [spikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_public_debt) (forgive me for linking to wikipedia but their page is quite comprehensive) in the debt during the Obama administration and Bush 2 successfully doubled the debt over 8 years, giving the appearance that there is something relatively new to the extent of out of control spending that I do not understand. I take issue with the Republicans for patently refusing to raise taxes on the ""job creators"" despite not providing evidence that the lower taxes actually result in more jobs than giving that money to the middle class, or to paying down the debt! That said I can easily go after either party for not making any proposals on entitlements or the military - when our defense budget equals the next 15 combined, something seems amiss, like we're mounting a defense for an enemy that doesn't exist. We very much agree about the need for and size/cost of our military.Regarding the military; the biggest potential geopolitical controversy I can foresee is China forcibly invading Taiwan, but that's about the limit of where I can see China claiming as that territory was truly their's a few hundred years back, but mounting a war against Japan or Australia would be political suicide and would compromise their economic success that has been so crucial to their rising world standing, furthermore they don't really have a legitimate claim anywhere else (plus Taiwan is a bit of a sticky personal issue dating back to a changing dynasty if memory serves). So we don't need a huge military to defend against a Chinese invasion. The hype about Iran is just hype - Iran with nuclear weapons is a threat to Israel, not the US, because Iran for all its other faults has a stable federal government that wants more than anything else to stay in power, where giving a nuclear weapon to terrorist to bomb a US city would completely remove their ability to stay in power and even bombing the Israelis would be a massive risk because of US-Israeli relations. So basically, we don't need a huge air force or army for either of these scenarios. A strong surface fleet from the navy can still project force as necessary to help smooth situations in favor of the US, which again begs the question of the purpose of the US military, but I'm already far enough off track that I'll stop without addressing that, just to say a big navy may still be a good idea.So all that said my BIGGEST concern out of all of this is that while we need to decrease federal spending, we're still in a recession. Unemployment might actually be above 8% because the state and local governments had to balance their budgets and thus cut employment, which is where the danger of austerity comes in. Trying to balance the budget when revenues are strong is comparatively trivial - hey Clinton managed it(!), but also a lot LESS dangerous to the health of the economy that the cuts you make while we struggle to meet the critical mass when consumer spending is consistently high. I am not an economist and they seem to disagree on the correct approach, but from what I've seen in Europe austerity seems to be closely connected to high unemployment, which is very bad and borrowing now when interest rates are so low is not as expensive as borrowing during high times when the rates are higher, so running up the deficit to get people working and spending money doesn't seem like such a bad idea. The Federal Government is in a weird position that unlike a business, when things are bad, I can very reasonably see why it would NOT be beneficial to cut spending as you cut funding to things that keep people working (like the auto bailouts) and in doing so keep towns floating above water both in the region where the cars are made and in the towns where parts are supplied, which allows other small businesses like pharmacies, grocery stores, gas stations and restaurants to maintain enough business that they can keep operating. If all those towns hugely dependent on one business lose that business, everything else that was supported by that will fail as people can't afford to eat out, or buy the higher margin items at the pharmacy or grocery store, hurting the profitability and viability of those businesses, while the town has to make cuts which can limit its police force and fire departments or DPW, which coupled with higher unemployment results in higher levels of crime, further harming those businesses. People will do what they need to survive, so its best if you don't push them to that limit or give them time to try what might be crazy ideas... Look at New Orleans after Katrina...So basically, we need to get control of the deficit, but wild and drastic cuts are likely to hurt us more in the long term, while running the deficit higher for the time being to reinvest in infrastructure could help modernize the US and get people working (and spending money) that will restart the economy. That and I feel like I need to be an economist to actually make appropriate judgements here. Thanks for reading my novel and I apologize for the typos I'm sure I committed."
c5ufz6y,,"spending on education isnt supposed to correlate with test scores. there are many factors involved in the increase in spending. i hope i dont have to explain these to you.the republicans put enormous ridiculous tax cuts in place, which the democrats want to get rid of but the republican majority in congress refuses to cooperate with anything they want to do. you have to spend money to save and create jobs when were in a horrible recession caused partly by the bush tax cuts. the republicans want to do the opposite of fix this.i dont see how people can defend them. this is no tin foil conspiracy, they really want to take money from the middle and lower class to line their pockets."
c5uhlh3,TonyCheeseSteak,"Well to begin I was not a fan of Bush, nor am I a fan of Obama as I am against big government. I do believe our education system is flawed but I also believe the testing and such vs other countries has a lot of flaws in it and is not credible. I was simply trying to point out the flaws in the comment I replies to, trying to show that spewing backless hate for a opposing party does no good. I wouldn't say that tax cuts caused the recession though. Also I don't think it is a fair statement to say Republicans want to take money from the middle/lower class to line their pockets. Can you give some evidence of this? I have not seen a bill where money is taken away from the middle/lower class and given to rich people. I believe this is a liberal talking point that really hurts the political climate in America. Also the notion you have to spend money to save money is ridiculous to me. You can save money via making large cuts into the government which is not being done on either side."
c5w63gq,,"can you justify the tax cuts? i provided backup for my point, you just said i dont think republicans want to take money from us."
c5ukunv,,The Ryan budget. And don't give me any shit about Obama cutting medicaid/medicare he found 700 billion being wasted that helps pay for Obamacare. Ryans first budget takes like over a billion from programs that help the middle and lower class to pay for tax cuts for the rich. How can you justify that? (not by saying it balances the budget because it won't for like 30 years)
c5ujfcz,,"This is a very misleading comment. The reason we spend more money on education is because schools now have to educate disabled kids instead of committing them. Disabled kids also have to be included in test scores. To compare 1970 to 2012 like that is like comparing apples to oranges. What should we do with extra money. Simple: hire more teachers, reduce class sizes to 20 or less, longer school day, and year round schooling.And before anyone goes on saying the unions won't go for it: bullshit. I am a teacher and most of us do."

c5uenup,luftwaffle0,"> Well, when one party has polarized itself so badly that they would sooner see us default on our debts, have its people die of preventable medical issues, and continually use a propaganda machine to lie to the many unfortunately uneducated citizens of the country (Note that they want to keep them uneducated, Republicans across the board continue to defund any meaningful education bills)Bastiat:>> Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.This is such a rudimentary element of right-wing thought that the only way you could possibly say such a thing is if you are ignorant (there's nothing wrong with that if you're willing to learn) or you yourself are the victim of a propaganda machine.If you don't realize that the idea that people on the right are racists that hate poor people is a product of a propaganda machine then I dunno, just think about it for like 1 second. It's incredibly effective and there's essentially no defense for it, because a true account for right wing thoughts requires patience to understand because of its nuance. Even the left's view of Rand's ideas about altruism are complete fabrications or at the very least misunderstandings.The Tea Party got owned because all you had to do was call them all racists, and everyone was so ready to believe it and so emotionally charged because of their belief, there was no reasoning them out of it.

For example, a sign showing Obama as a monkey or a sign saying keep your government hands off my medicare. So which signs are real and which aren't?This is why I don't really think it's a great idea to use protest signs or individual protesters as examples of what a movement is supposed to be about. You will definitely find idiots and you will definitely find agent provocateurs (who are actively seeking attention no less).> And the first one shows a Nazi being badgered by someone with a camera. There is absolutely no proof that he was sent to infiltrate and that did not just show up on his own accord. And there is no proof the guy with the camera speaks for the entire Tea Party.Nor is there any proof that he is with the tea party. But I think that the overall crowd reaction to the guy and the fact that he was eventually pressured to leave shows that a lot of the characterizations of the average tea partier are completely unfair. It's actually a bit heartbreaking to me because a lot of them are good folks that are participating peacefully in something they're passionate about. I'd be pretty upset if my mom or grandma felt passionate about something, went to a rally, and then she was disparaged as a racist or that she hates poor people."
c5uo874,loondawg,"I'm not claiming that proves or disproves anything. I am just casting what I think is reasonably suspicion on the examples you provided as proof of infiltration.It's too bad. I actually think the Tea Party started out with some ideas that deserved consideration. Unfortunately they were taken over, almost from the start, by old name republicans trying to re-brand the party after its crushing defeats and by big money trying to co-opt the movement for their own selfish reasons.I have never personally called the movement racist. However I have spoken with many people who call themselves members who are clearly following racist motivations. And that unfortunately, does reflect badly on the group as a whole. It's similar to the way the bad behavior of a few of the OWS people was used to brand the whole movement."

The Tea Party from the start was anti-bailout so it's not like the big banks have supported them.I think the ""corporate takeover"" thing is something that was made up and now people just repeat it. I never saw any wavering of the message, which is all that matters.In my opinion, the Tea Party was destroyed (well, it still exists) by a calculated and widespread disinformation campaign."

But is wasn't until early 2009, right after the republicans got destroyed in the elections, that the Tea Party started getting much national attention. And that, not coincidentally, followed many national discussions about how the republicans needed to re-brand the party.And the movement grew in large part due to promotion, rather than an assault, by major media outlets. Fox News took the lead running positive stories and actively promoting their meetings. C-SPAN followed suite covering pretty much every meeting where more than three of them showed up. And when [Dick Armey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Armey) becomes one of the lead spokesmen, well, that pretty much tells you who is really pulling the strings."

Eventually a multi-party system will devolve into a two party system.In Canada our federal right leaning parties have all merged into the Conservative party. I don't suspect the NDP and the Liberals won't eventually merge together to unite the left. Particularly not with the pasting the liberals just had in the last federal election. Unfortunately all we have left is the Bloc Quebecois and the Green Party ( they have 1 seat atm), neither of which have been able to resonate with voters across the country ( the Bloc for obvious reasons )Edit: libs and ndp are left, not right.

I don't see people here jumping up to defend the current Republicans because they appear to be indefensible. What I *do* see is a lot of people in denial of how bad the situation is becoming.

c5ujzk1,Shoden,"> Romney has been so much more successful in life than Obama.Funny, one of them became president of the united states first, I would say that makes Obama pretty successful."
c5ut0l9,canthidecomments,"If that's the only measure with which you define greatness, then you'd be right.You'd also be very shortsighted.When you think of Barack Obama, and his accomplishments, do you think ... ""now there's a great man.""No, you don't.He stumbled his way through life voting present and working the system by trading on his skin color to get perks none of the rest of us get and became an accidental president by a quirk of history and having ""dirty"" Jesse Jackson to compare his ""clean"" self to (in the words of Joe Biden). Recall the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize that he was so embarrassed to receive having done nothing to earn it that he gave all the money away and admitted he didn't deserve the award. Then launched a third war - undeclared and unauthorized by the United States Congress, mind you - against brown people for their oil.I know of nobody who thinks Barack Obama is a great man, or believes he has done anything great.And you don't think he's a great man either.(PS: You should capitalize United States when you write it out ... or it makes you seem like you're trivializing your country.)"
c5ut32r,Shoden,"> If that's the only measure with which you define greatnessI said nothing of greatness, only success. Obama has successfully become president. If this wasn't something to strive for, Romney wouldn't be doing it either I suppose."

Or something.)Becoming President in the way that Barack Obama became President - a nation attempting to demonstrate to itself that it wasn't racist - doesn't confer on an individual an actual accomplishment. You have to do something worthy AFTER you become President besides bomb brown people with drones.Obama was ""clean"" as Joe Biden said. The first ""clean"" black man (not really black, though) to ever run for the Presidency (clean, at least compared to his competition ... Jesse Jackson, who fathered kids out of wedlock). And so he was elected. And then he accomplished not much of anything (unless you count forcing poor people to buy insurance from his donors or risk having the IRS seize their homes) before he's shuffled off into the pages of history ala Jimmy Carter (another accidental President elected only because of one-off circumstance.)"
c5uv486,Shoden,> You also never said Obama IS a great man (I noticed that).He is a Fantastic President.> a nation attempting to demonstrate to itself that it wasn't racistBy that logic Romney would only become president due to the nation trying to prove it doesn't discriminate against someones religion.

c5uet53,JordanLeDoux,"It's plainly apparent that Republicans have things which they would not sell out or budge on philosophically. Among them, I believe, is the preferential treatment of Christian values, which is something that some people want in our society.Another, I think, is the ability of our military to assure the destruction of any other individual country if we had to, which there are a great number of people who view as prudent. Many people don't think too hard about it, but America as a society was deeply scarred by WW2. (Which is not to say that many other countries were not left with deeper scars.)I think in a lot of ways, the US people came out of WW2 going, ""holy shit, we've just been over here doing our thing and the whole rest of the world is batshit insane!"" For some, there was a feeling that we had been sensible and steadily improving for the past 150 years, and that the rest of the world appeared to be like overly destructive children. It's a description of the emotive response of the populace.Republicans are still mostly in this mindset. They view us as the adults, and think that the rest of the world is full of 5 years olds that will cause a mess as soon as we turn around. It's not strictly speaking a crazy position to hold, but it is a very ethnocentric one, which IMO is primarily caused by the fact that we teach very little history to people, especially history of the rest of the world.To many Republicans, no one ever taught them the series of connected events and circumstances that the rest of the world went through in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, and without that information history really does look kind of like:""Oh hey, here's America, just doing our thing and making progress... Oh, what the fuck!? Why is a WHOLE continent going to war over a stupid royal figure guy? Well at least the people that started it lost... wait, how the hell did they come back with all those tanks and shit!? And why are they collecting all those civilians? They're killing them with pesticides!?! Oh Jesus! Where's the part where we knock these sick bastards out!Well goddammit, why didn't we do shit BEFORE we got bombed?? Well at least that's over... I guess we'll have to give them a bunch of money to rebuild... wait a minute... why is all that liberated land in the East still being controlled by Russia? Hey! He's putting people in camps too! Shit, and now they have nuclear bombs so we can't force them to stop... Well what if they keep doing that around the rest of the world? Better look into that... Wait, what's that noise in China? Wait, Korea? Vietnam? Shit, Afghanistan? Iran? Iraq?When will it stop?""Without all the historical context of the REST of the world's history, it kind of looks like we're perfectly reasonable, and everyone else is absolutely fucking bonkers.It also helps if you hide some of our history with regard to the CIA."

c5uibqd,someotherguy4112,"I promise this isn't a sock puppet, I'm a lurker who felt the need to chime in here. I will preface this by saying I'm a moderate and neither Conservative nor Liberal and if it helps anyone my favorite senator (who the republicans loathed) was Olympia Snow.Anyhow the US's Military policy isn't about WWII aftershock or some idea of us as a grown adult policing children. That is an incredibly childish point of view and the people who advice our President and Congress on military policy are not children.What happened during at after WWII was that the policy of isolationism the US had been practicing was proven to be false. That events happening on the other side of the world could have repercussions and effect the USA, those repercussions could be both negative and positive. The logical following this is that if the US wanted to have an effect on those events and attempt to coerce them to what is good for the USA.I know the instant reaction to this is shock and horror, please realize that nations have no morals nor are required to have them. Nations are composed of people and therefor what is best for those people is best for that nation. The government of any nation's first priority should always be to seek the best for the people it represents. Nations are in effect self serving entities. That's how it's been since the first gathering of walking apes decided to form a tribe. This isn't so say governments always do their job, that's a different argument altogether.The Military is a tool, nothing more nothing less. It's purpose is to create and control violence as ordered by the government. This violence may be offensive or defensive, again controlled by the government which is supposed to be representative of it's people. Ultimately the military serves the national interests. One of the way it serves a nations national interest is in projecting power, which is just another way of saying to make another nation do what you want them to do. Again *shock + horror*, yet nations are amoral and seek their best interests, hence the presence of a military.Now that we've went over that, this is why the US does what it does. It is in the US's best interest that no aggressive superpower is formed that could incite another World War. Under this policy small limited regional conflicts are acceptable if they prevent the creation of a World War. For the better part of 60 years this policy has worked, there have been no major conflicts. We're counting dead in thousands not millions. I honestly hope our future leaders understand this policy and that the military isn't a police force for ""World Peace"" but a tool to ensure no World War III happens. Using this policy it should be clear to anyone why the US builds bases where they do and why they spend so much. It was determined to be cheaper in the long run to fund an advanced active military capable of stopping anything on the planet then it was to have another World War. Korea was an attempt to stop the spread of communism and thus prevent a large alliance between the USSR and other communistic nations. Vietnam was the same. In both case's the US was fighting Chinese fighters equipped and funded by the soviets. We won once and it yielded a country that ranks in the top 15 of world economies, we lost another and anyone can freely look up how that turned out. Also remember both Korea and Vietnam were started by Soviet backed communist factions who decided they wanted to run their respective countries. Afghanistan was a UN operation not a US one, this is commonly forgotten in world propaganda. There existed an aggressive force that decided it would like to go around attacking and harassing the USA and anyone else it liked. If the USA wouldn't of done anything then it would be been very bad. Iraq was a sh!t storm that we never should of got into. There was absolutely no geo political reason to deal with the utter nightmare that turned into. There is also no reason to stay around in Afghanistan after their ruling religious faction was destroyed, it's not the US's business to go around creating nations. I hope our future leaders learn these lessons and do not ever commit the force to any situation that isn't in the best interests of the USA.Now I'm not arguing how effective our leadership has been in following this basic principle, they are humans and humans make mistakes and can be wrong. Honestly IMO I think Obama has done a great job so far. He has not caved to the extreme left members of the Democratic party and he is obviously not a conservative. That puts him as a moderate liberal regardless of how far right the conservatives move. Unless the Republicans can pull some sort of insane magic between here and November to convince me otherwise, Obama has by vote so far."

Being ""Fair and balanced"" and saying ""both parties have faults,"" is exactly why Republicans and Fox News can get the attention of half the country instead of being ousted into the street for being the party of the insane.In other countries, you would never have a party like the US GOP get any traction because everyone would dismiss their stupidity from the start. Here though, you have people like you, who say ""yes both parties are bad. Yes both sides have faults! Yes neither Obama nor Romney are perfect."" --- It provides NOTHING productive. It is completely counter-productive.All you've done is express your partisan beliefs about how you hate Obama, good job. You provided no argument, no substance, no facts.**Everyone knows everyone has faults, no one claimed Obama was a perfect angel--INCLUDING THIS POST right in the title: ""OBAMA IS NOT THE PERFECT PRESIDENT...""**"
c5uej5z,mattrad2,But Republicans actually DO have a lot of good ideas... as do Democrats. The shitty equivalency is real.
c5uevpf,executex,"Equivalency does not mean ""Party X has 3 good ideas, Party Y has 15 good ideas."" Equivalency means ""Party X and Y have 4 good ideas.""Hence, there is no equivalency.And to be honest, Democrats have hundreds of good ideas, while Republicans rarely have any good ideas."
c5uf36q,SatinHandyWipe,like....?
c5uflsb,sspaiva,"Your last statement is essentially the equivalent of saying ""Hey, I like these guys cause they think exactly like I do."" Isn't that the same close-minded thought processes that Democrats attack Republicans on?"
c5ugt5h,executex,"No it isn't. I've said Democrats have had the best and most ideas. Republicans have not. I can prove it. FDIC insurance. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Food stamps, Obamacare, Glass-Steagall Act. All created by Democrats, and signed into law by Democratic presidents and probably had the most significant effects to the US than most other laws.They've created Cabinet departments, such as Dept. Of Education and Dept. of Energy. These were great ideas. Other than the EPA created by Nixon, which Republicans today want to underfund and remove, name me some things that Republicans created and supported strongly, that were incredibly great ideas that don't predate the 20th century."
c5umtun,sspaiva,"You're proving my exact point here though. You're saying that Democrats have had, what you call, the “best ideas” while Republicans have not. You have to realize that that's extremely subjective, and truly a matter of opinion, not fact. That's what is biased about your claims.You then went on to list examples of those ideas that you believe to be the best, without acknowledging the fact that many of those that you brought up have caused much debate and speculation throughout the past years, many of which are still occurring today. Therefore, you cannot just assume an ‘end-all, be-all' approach and stamp your seal of approval on something and call it a ‘great idea', without first understanding the flaws and criticisms involved with them which has sparked debate. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Food Stamps are all things that require major reform in modern times, as they are just not sustainable for the future. Obamacare is an extremely hot-topic debate, and the issues of government vs. private-run healthcare are disagreements that will occur far into the foreseeable future, I'd imagine. Glass-Steagall has even had many pitfalls within the bill, which has caused loopholes for corporations to slip through the cracks, and/or cause over-regulation for corporations that didn't previously require the heavier burden. Same thing for the Depts. of Education and Energy. Just like Obamacare, those departments have caused the ever-continuing debate of having government-run programs vs. private-run programs. Some would say that having the government in education causes positive change for lowering costs via providing grants, funds, etc, while others argue that the grants cause inflation in college tuition costs, and by bringing education closer to the local governments, tuition costs will decrease. Certainly, there are pros and cons on both sides of the issue that you have to examine, but that continues on my very point. These issues are much too multi-faceted to look at in such black and white terms. There are multiple angles and sub-issues within every debate, and in order to have an intelligent discussion about them, one must be able to understand that he/she cannot just assume these types of ‘end-all be-all' approaches that you keep taking."
c5uzd5u,executex,"> and truly a matter of opinion, not fact. That's what is biased about your claims.No it is NOT. It is a matter of FACT.FACT.

Raise taxes. They are absolutely sustainable. Problem is again with the Republicans who scream about taxes.>while others argue that the grants cause inflation in college tuition costs, and by bringing education closer to the local governments, tuition costs will decrease.

This is ignorance at its finest. Acting like as if both sides are rational and just players in a video game. No. One side is trying to destroy everything because they've become deluded by their own propaganda, the other side is trying to fix things without being hung by the fear-mongering and hate-mongering by the other side."
c5v2kh6,sspaiva,"Biased, biased, biased. Absolutely biased. You cannot say that the improvements of our country throughout the past century have come solely from the ideas of just one political ideology. You can't be serious when you can't say things like that. You just can't. You and I both know it.>The quality of life in America increased greatly after many of the laws I've mentionedSaying that the quality of life has increased greatly throughout the past century is an obvious claim, and it can't be simplified and summarized so easily by just saying a few laws passed created that. What about the Meat Inspection Act, the Pure Food and Drug Act, and the creation the American School Hygiene association, all passed under Republican Theodore Roosevelt? What about the Interstate Highway system that we all know today, created under Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower? Or the Clear Skies Act of 2003, passed under Republican George W. Bush? Look, I can go listing these just like you did, but that's not going to do anything. The point I've making, and what I've trying to make all along, is that the successes of our country from the past century has not come from just one place. It is come from a multitude of places, which includes but is not limited to only political parties.Your 'us. vs. them' mentality that you seem to have does nothing progressive for our country. No measurable progress will come of our Congress, and government overall, if we keep playing this 'I'm right, they're wrong' game.>Why is it that in every issue, you act like both sides have to have some ""pros and cons""Because both side DO have pros and cons.

And claiming that by I'm ignorant for saying that, must put you in a level of ignorance that I can't even comprehend. >One side is trying to destroy everything because they've become deluded by their own propaganda,This is sooooo biased, it's crazy. Really? Every single Republican in the nation is deluded and wants to destroy everything in their path? Every single one of them? Do you understand how insane that sounds? Even saying that a handful of them want to do something like that is even crazy. I think the reason you say things like that is because you don't agree with their policies and standpoints, but just because you don't, doesn't make them crazed maniacs. I think it might be making you one."
c5uemiq,AntiSophist,"<First, I am not a Fox News defender.Secondly Obama has yet to pardon 1 non violent drug offender. Has bombed Militants(innocents) in 5 plus countries throughout his term, so his Nobel Peace Prize is a sham. Has increased the taxes on the middleClass by allowing bank bail outs. Including having zero attention placedOn incarcerating the banker criminals who stole from the government. And Lastly he is no saint, he is just like Romney a bag of wind. I want to stab myself in the hand for voting and believing in his propaganda for Change and all his bullshit about returning to the country our founding fathers believed in. His innaugaration speech made meCry. I want him to answer for his lies."
c5uestb,executex,"1. I didn't say you were, I said the way you talk in /r/politics is only helping the agenda of Fox News. Don't take it as an insult, but look at it objectively.2. Obama can't by-law pardon someone who wasn't convicted and who didn't plead guilty.3. Obama doesn't bomb innocents, he bombs identified terrorists based on national intelligence which you are not privy to. Sometimes innocents get hurt. But at least Obama is smart enough to use precision drone strikes, instead of imprecise airstrikes, carpet bombing, shock and awe, or occupation like Bush did to kill terrorists. 4. Bank bailouts did not increase taxes on the middle class. That's false. Banks were given loans, which many of them were paid back fully, and they were given by the federal reserve, not by tax payers.5. Bankers are smart. They tricked people like you into voting Republican, who deregulated the system, changed the laws, so that everything they do is perfectly LEGAL. Hence why no one can be prosecuted today. It's also incredibly tough to prove guilt in financial crime. And the SEC was underfunded by a Republican congress.6. [Check Obamameter.](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/) Read through it carefully. Then decide if you think Obama lied or was generally trying his best. In terms of quantity of promises delivered and factually, he was doing many of the things he promised. He was true to his inauguration speech. You've been misinformed by the powerful propaganda of the right-wing and their efforts in congress to block everything Obama tries to do."
c5uf50a,SatinHandyWipe,"Wow. You are dumb. I'm just going to go with number 3 here.Obama wasn't there at the start of the war, so carpet bombing and shock and awe were finished by then. It would have been done the same way... as Obama knows NOTHING of the military and would just be looking to his advisers. I served overseas during the Bush era and I'll be damned if we didn't use precision drones and other less destructive tactics."
c5ugumh,executex,"You're speculating. Bush started the Iraq War on faulty intelligence and illegally without much international support. It's really dumb of you now, to talk badly about Obama when you could have been killed for a war that was of absolutely no importance to national security."
c5uf2d2,AntiSophist,"Instead of touching on every issue. I'd like to take time to respond to your obviously brainwashed mind. I am not a right winger. Do I appreciate conservatism, yes. So you instinctively classifying an attack on your philosophy as some sort of a game plan assembled by someone I am affiliated with (your opposing team), is the first flaw in your illogical streamline thinking. Your defense of his Military actions is what is very dangerous about the Military Industrial Complex and bought politicians like Obama. They have you convinced that like you said ""it was necessary"" then you followed with ""you and I are not privy to the information used to make those decisions"". See the flaw? You defended anti-terrorist attacks with an absolutist approach of necessity for our safety. Yet you have no idea why these people were killed. For instance, If anti-terrorism is so important 13/18 of the terrorists in 9/11 were Saudi. Where's the bombs on that one? Your answer to that question will always be, that is until you open your mind, ""we are not privy to such intel"". So please humor yourself into believing in any Democratic leader who tells you they're for peace, yet bombs countries like Libya where 100 to 1000 Militants(definition from administration of militant = any male of military fighting age) for no necessary cause. Except that we are to believe it is to make us safer. No it makes us assholes, murderers, and inspires future terrorists like Bin Laden to arise and show the American population what they have suffered under our elected officials Military Industrial Complex driven Imperialism. Even Clinton fell victim to this."
c5ugwne,executex,"Libya should be bombed. Gadaffi was airstriking his own citizens. Obama was 100% right on being involved there.What's dangerous is that you are attacking Obama , while simultaneously you warn of the dangers of the Military Industrial Complex, something Republicans have always supported 100% of the time. Yes, they were Saudi, but it was Bush who decided that Saudi Arabia was an ally and not part of the problem. Their training camps were in Afghanistan though.No, Libya isn't about making us safer, it was to prevent a huge massacre. Have you no human decency that you feel that NATO shouldn't be involved in stopping madmen about to massacre thousands of their own civilians? Have you no decency that when a terrible terrorist-supporting dictator's position of power is threatened, you take no advantage of it?If your worry is imperialism---why would you accuse Obama, when Mitt Romney just the other day talked about how ""Obama is doing nothing about a nuclear armed Iran."" Mitt Romney, went to Israel telling people how he will be tougher on Iran. You're not worried about imperialism when it comes to Republicans, but you're worried about Democrats? Weird as fuck."
c5ujo75,AntiSophist,"I swear it's like brushing my Dogs' teeth talking to you. All I'm trying to do is help you and you keep pulling away. Can your party do any harm? I'm not even a supporter of Romney or any Republican ideal and yet that is your retort, that I am. Libya was having an internal conflict. Would you expect another country to bomb our military if it's squashing an uprising? How often does Obama stopIsrael from murdering Palestinians? Instead he gives a speech promising to commit to Israel further. So you brought up another brainwashed argument that Obama actually cares about human rights internationally."

c5umzun,AntiSophist,Brick wall.
c5ufi2e,sspaiva,"Your argument is interesting to me. You say I've 'provided no argument, no substance, no facts', and yet you wrote your entire post degrading mine, without offering any shred of those same arguments, substance, or facts. Interesting.Having said that, let's talk about what I believe was substance in my original post. I'm not supporting either side here, but I was trying to make the case that you can't so easily judge a person or entire political party based on purely one-sided arguments that you may hear from biased sources. Therefore, I found it funny that you chose to ignore that point, while simultaneously proving my exact point when you said the ""US GOP wouldn't get any traction because everyone would dismiss their stupidity"". Who is 'everyone' anyway? Surely, there are plenty of GOP members who would refute that. Same goes for your 'stupidity' claim, which I worry is just the term you immediately conclude to when you don't agree with someone else's opinion.Thirdly, I don't see how offering the idea that 'no party is perfect' is counter-productive here. We have an extremely polarized political system, arguably one of the worst we've ever seen. While you drive the idea of polarization further by refusing to listen to any opposing opinions, I tend to believe that understanding that both parties have flaws can be a crucial gateway to having some true bipartisanship and cooperation in our government, a trait that I believe is truly lacking. Lastly, on a side note, I'm not exactly sure why Fox News is being brought into this debate. Neither the OP or myself mentioned the organization. I fear that you bringing them up merely has to do with a common thought process that I hear often that somehow revolve around the idea that all Republicans and Fox News are intertwined together. Let me once again re-iterate the same point I've been trying to make here all along. Not all Republicans are the same. Do not treat them as such. Funny thing is, I'm not even a Republican."
c5ugxmh,executex,I don't understand you at all. You think Republicans are the party of intelligence? You don't think the risk of war with Iran increases when you criticize Obama and pretend he is an equal to Romney? You think Fox News and Republicans are not intertwined together? **Are you fucking kidding me?**
c5umu1w,sspaiva,"I've noticed a continuous trend in the posts you've sent to me: you tend of jump to conclusions extremely easily, don't you?Allow me to, once again, try to explain what I'm driving at here. Nowhere in my posts to you thus far, have I made the assertion that the Republican Party is the ‘party of intelligence', while the Democratic Party is not. To quote myself from earlier, “I'm not supporting either side here, but I was trying to make the case that you can't so easily judge a person or entire political party based on purely one-sided arguments that you may hear from biased sources.”. So let's just toss that assumption from you out from the start here. So, I ask that you don't put words into your mouth to fuel an argument that you've perceived to exist, when in reality, I've never said anything of the sort.Another trend I've noticed has been the fact that you also tend to bring in side subjects that no one was mentioning earlier, and yet bring it into the argument like it was discussed all along. The first example of that was when you brought in the idea of Fox News out of right field (which I'll touch on later in this post), but then the second example just in your last post about Iran. How in the world did the concept of Iran get pulled into this? Where did that argument even come from? How is debating the equality between political parties increasing the risk of a war with Iran? Also, how does criticizing Obama also increase the same risk? Is he the only one allowed to tackle the issue of Iran?Lastly, I'll tackle to idea of Fox News again too. While I'm still not really sure how that got brought into this, let me re-iterate my last comment which actually re-iterated my first post on the subject. Maybe the third time will work here: “Not all Republicans are the same. Do not treat them as such.” So, to answer your question, no. Not ALL Republicans are intertwined with Fox News. I know it may be hard to believe. On one final side note, I have never once sworn or used vulgar language towards you in any of these discussions, so why are you swearing at me saying things like ‘are you fucking kidding me'? Why are you getting so frustrated and aggressive when someone wants to debate on an issue?"
c5uzc4o,executex,Because the things you say are insane. You don't deserve a debate. You actually claim Republicans are not intertwined with Fox News.You actually claim that saying both parties are equal---is not creating a huge advantage and benefit to the Republican party including increasing the risk of war with Iran. If you felt that Iran is an important issue. If you believed that what Romney says in his speeches are true and that war in Iran would be bad. You wouldn't work so hard to be a partisan and advocate that the two candidates are the same.
c5v3o53,sspaiva,"Okay. I can't keep repeating myself over and over again here. I'm going to try one last time by taking in the 5 statements you mentioned in your last comment, with the hope that in conjunction with our debate we've having in another thread, you can understand where I'm coming from. >Because the things you say are insane. You don't deserve a debate.This is the core issue here. Just because you don't agree with someone's standpoints or ideologies, does not make them insane. If you're not willing to sit down and have an intelligent debate with a person who's ideas are different than yours, then you're never going to be have perspective, a trait commonly lacking in today's polarized politics. It's okay to compromise on some things, it's okay to make mutual sacrifices, we don't always need to have this 'winner take-all', or this 'us vs. them' approach. >You actually claim Republicans are not intertwined with Fox News.This irrelevant subpoint has been going on for way too long as well. How many times do I have to say this? Are some Republicans involved in the broadcasting of Fox News? Yes. Even some Democrats are involved in the broadcasting of Fox News. But, I've said it before, and I'll say it again, not ALL Republicans are involved with the broadcasting of Fox News. Just like one would say not ALL Democrats are involved with MSNBC. It's just not fair of you to cast an entire party onto one organization, and to assume that every single person within that party is doing the same thing.>You actually claim that saying both parties are equal---is not creating a huge advantage and benefit to the Republican party including increasing the risk of war with Iran.Please refer to our debate thread for a longer analysis of this. But essentially, and I know this may be hard for you to hear, but yes. The two parties are equal. No one party is better than the other, as great ideas that have helped shaped our country into what it is today have had their genesis in both of parties. You mentioned in another posts that Democrats have increased the quality of life in this country, and if you truly think the increase of quality of life has come from solely one party or faction, then that's incomprehensible to me.Also, what is with this Iran thing? Do you honestly think that the Republican party are the only ones interested in disarming the possible nuclear capabilities of Iran? Do you not think that covert ops are already swarming that country, and disarming and disabling the Iranian technology that helps Iran create weapons?>If you felt that Iran is an important issue. If you believed that what Romney says in his speeches are true and that war in Iran would be bad.I actually don't know where you got this from, I actually don't feel that Iran is that important of an issue. The covert ops occurring in that country is suitable enough to withhold any further technological advances. In actuality, most Republican candidates, including Romney, have said the same, and have only offering the idea of striking militarily as a method of 'keeping all options on the table'. Hell, President Obama has said that.>You wouldn't work so hard to be a partisan and advocate that the two candidates are the same.How am I being partisan? I've been the one advocating the two parties are same in character, not in ideology, and I have never said Romney and Obama are exactly the same. Obviously, the two parties have differences, but that doesn't make them enemies. At least it shouldn't. The people who do make them enemies, such as yourself, are only serving to hold back to the country and remove the idea of anything progressive occurring in this country. We need compromise and unity to move forward. When there's this much polarization in Congress and in this country, that cannot happen. To remedy that, we need sacrifices on both sides of the aisle.I'm honestly not sure what else I can say on the matter."
c5ujmep,serioush,"The two party system sucks donkey cocks, having elections where a single person gets elected creates 2 party systems, this requires a revolution to fix.BUT, untill that time, there is still a difference between the lizards and some policies are still better than others.If everything does go down the shitter, take solace in the fact you will be able to lynch people when the revolution comes."

c5ufkih,sspaiva,"I agree with you in the sense that I could have probably worded that better, because that does seem like a contradiction. I think you're missing the core part of my comment though. The OP's post harped on this idea that while Obama may not be doing the best job possible, Romney and 'all Republicans' only care about their bank accounts. That's inherently biased. The OP is demonizing an entire political party, based on thoughts he/she believes to be true, without factual evidence to justify that the literal entire party is all 'only caring about their bank accounts'. That's bias, and in order to have an effective debate, things like that need to be immediately thrown out."
c5ujqfm,Ambiwlans,"I agree, jamming the GOP like that was uncalled for and clearly biased. I didn't miss your point there.I think that if the post were just the first sentence I could agree with it. I think overall, most politicians including Obama and even Romney are trying to do good. Hell, almost all people on the planet are trying to do good. Some are just... better at it than others.That said, you did seem to move from simply knocking down the fallacious argument at the top on to the false equivalency that we here on reddit are so accustomed to. Which is sad. And you seemed to do so by putting word's in OP's mouth. Which you really didn't need to do. It didn't seem like a contradiction, it was.

He's obviously running for something else. He knows any time in the White House would cost him many millions. It will shave years off his lifespan. He will age rapidly under the extreme stress.

He doesn't run on social values-- he just poses as having one set of social values or another depending on the electorate he's courting at the time. All I really see is a guy who wants to cut taxes a whole bunch in a way that favors the rich, favors corporations, and then I'm supposed to think my life is going to get better because really rich people and really profitable companies are paying less in taxes? Fuck that. He's selling it as the way to fix the economy, but this guy would be gunning to slash taxes regardless of the state of the economy. He's using the bad economy as an opportunity to pass his rich man's entitlements and shift tax burden onto the middle class. He's kicking the middle class while it's down.Rich men broke the economy and now they're going to fix it by making the victims pay more while they pay less. Well that's just fucking great! Mitt Romney is a walking insult to the American people. He has no business running for president."
c5ui59v,Afrodaddy,"""A walking insult"" is a little harsh... just because he has a different opinion on economics. I think the fact that he's successful and obviously knows how to handle money (hence the being painfully wealthy thing) is what his supporters like about the dude"
c5ughui,Kharos,"You just have to look through everything Mitt Romney has done and said to get to where he is to realize that he's not working toward an ideal or any noble goal, whatever that might be for him. I don't think he's there for the money either though considering how wealthy he already is.I think he just wants to be president. That's it. When you're as wealthy and (consequently) as powerful as Mitt Romney, the only thing you're missing is immortality. One way you can achieve that (in a sense) is by being written down in history as a US president.Of course this is merely my opinion."

Presidential candidates nor Presidents themselves are leaders in their respective party's. All parties have an agenda, goals and things they want done. To achieve those goals they have nominations and primary's to select the best candidate who can achieve those goals. After that selection all party resources go to fueling that candidate in an attempt to put them in a place of power that then can be used. After that candidates term is up, they tend to be discarded as their usefulness has been expended.Honestly Obama winning the Democratic primary in 2008 was an utter shock to me. Hillary was obviously the favorite of the party leaders, yet Obama had proved to be the more popular amongst the party's voters and thus got the nomination.Political races make much more sense when you look at it that way. The real leaders and setters of agenda of each party are not elected nor really public figures. They couldn't do their job of advancing the party's political power if they were subject to constant political scrutiny."

Also, bad policy is bad policy regardless of whether you campaigned on it or not, so please don't mention how Obama said he would refocus on Afghanistan.They did not force him to hire the likes of Summers and Geithner, go after dispensaries more aggressively than Bush, prosecute a record number of whistle blowers, to ignore the actions of Bush administration officials, take a relatively aggressive posture against Iran, invoke the state secrets privilege numerous times to prevent cases from going to trial, etc.And these are just issues where Congress has no direct power. I'm sure there are areas where Obama has put in a lackluster effort when it comes to getting Congress to address issues where they do have direct power.

They may very well be leaving the option open, which is what many of these intelligence agencies believe.In the most recent round of talks I believe Iran offered to stop 20% enrichment in exchange for the recognition of its rights to enrich and the scaling back of sanctions. The US refused this.Iran also does have a right to enrich to 20% in order to build research reactors, so while it may be concerning it should not be used to justify drastic action.Did you read the WaPO article on Gitmo? You may think it is inaccurate, but one key point is that Obama made a lackluster effort to close Gitmo.Politifact says: ""It also establishes a ""periodic review"" process for for long-held Guantanamo detainees who have not been charged, convicted or designated for transfer, ""but must continue to be detained because they 'in effect, remain at war with the United States,'"" according to a White House fact-sheet.""How does the White House esablish this? They can be detained indefinitely without trial. How nice.LBJ had many problems of his own and legislative success does not necessairly mean that the legislation will be successful. Obamacarae is unlikely to to do much to keep healthcare spending under control (this does not mean I think it will increse the debt) and many financial analysts believe Dodd-Frank is insuffieicient to stop future crises.Update: Did you actually read the links on Climate Change I provided or just post links that presented Obama in a favorable light on this issue? While I do get upset from Obama from time to time I certainly don't think he is aboslutely awful. I just don't think he is anything special.

c5udyd1,doodlebro,"I want you to shut the hell up about ""Obama's war on MMJ"" and listen here.In the last year or so, the DEA has closed about 60 dispensaries in Colorado, and a handful in California.

The law to not sell drugs within 1000 feet of a school zone was signed into the books in the **BUSH** administration as a part of No Child Left Behind. Do you know how many dispensaries are still open in Colorado? At least 1000. 60 out of 1000 is roughly *6%* of the total dispensaries. And you're telling me Obama is better for MMJ than Bush?Wait, wait, this gets better. Some dispensaries in California were closed for the same reason, within 1000 feet of any school. Most of them, however, were closed for violating state MMJ laws or violating **LOCAL** MMJ laws. Certain cities and districts flat out banned dispensaries. When those dispensaries didn't move, you know who swooped in? ***The motherfucking DEA.*** Obama said that he wouldn't have federal resources wasted on *LAW ABIDING* dispensaries in MMJ states.So, do you know how many dispensaries are still open in California? THOUSANDS.I don't see where you get your logic for this, but I'm going to tell you that you're flat out wrong.

There were reasons they were shut down. I don't care what law it was they were violating, they were shut down for it.

Because Israel might prematurely attack Iran, which will lead to suffering among Iranian civilians that we have to essentially preempt it through sanctions? Did you think the sanctions in Iraq that ended up killing hundreds of thousand were justified?The ACLU gave Obama a one torch/star (it's right at the beginning of you link) on closing Gitmo and ending indefinite detention. They are highly criticial of Obama in this area. Politifact also said it was a broken promise by Obama in the link you provided.Obama hired Geithner and Summers who were in positions of power before the crisis and helped cause the crisis. Gethner, less so, but still he was in an important position of power (President of NY Fed) and served under Summers when he Secretary of the Traeaury under Clinton. Obama also kept Bernanke for that matter.I don't think Dodd-Frank is terrible, but it just does not do nearly enough. Obviously, all of this does not fall on Obama, but Too Big to Fail is still an issue and Obama has refused to call for the break up of these banks.Dodd-Frank does have issues though:http://www.propublica.org/article/from-dodd-frank-to-dudhttp://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-10/too-big-to-fail-not-fixed-despite-dodd-frank-commentary-by-simon-johnson.htmlhttp://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/is-dodd-frank-overdue-or-overkill-2-dueling-views/http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/03/dallas-feds-fisher-criticizes-dodd-frank-as-not-going-far-enough-on-tbtf.htmlFrom the last link:""He calls for higher capital levels at the biggest banks and argues they should reduce dividends. He also doubts that Dodd Frank resolutions will work: Will the new resolution procedures be adequate in a major financial crisis? Big banks often follow parallel business strategies and hold similar assets. In hard times, odds are that several big financial institutions will get into trouble at the same time.14 Liquid assets are a lot less liquid if these institutions try to sell them at the same time. A nightmare scenario of several big banks requiring attention might still overwhelm even the most far-reaching regulatory scheme. In all likelihood, TBTF could again become TMTF—too many to fail, as happened in 2008. A second important issue is credibility. Going into the financial crisis, markets assumed there was government backing for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds despite a lack of explicit guarantees. When push came to shove, Washington rode to the rescue. Similarly, no specific mandate existed for the extraordinary governmental assistance provided to Bear Stearns, AIG, Citigroup and Bank of America in the midst of the financial crisis.15 Lehman Brothers didn't get government help, but many of the big institutions exposed to Lehman did.16 Words on paper only go so far. What matters more is whether bankers and their creditors actually believe Dodd–Frank puts the government out of the financial bailout business. If so, both groups will practice more prudent behavior… The pretense of toughness on TBTF sounds the right note for the aftermath of the financial crisis. But it doesn't give the watchdog FSOC and the Treasury secretary the foresight and the backbone to end TBTF by closing and liquidating a large financial institution in a manner consistent with Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (see Box 1). The credibility of Dodd–Frank's disavowal of TBTF will remain in question until a big financial institution actually fails and the wreckage is quickly removed so the economy doesn't slow to a halt. Nothing would do more to change the risky behav- ior of the industry and its creditors."""

As such the cirticisms leveled in the links I posted as well as in the one I quoted may still very well be valid.Hoenig supports a return to Glass-Steagall or at least a modern version of it that would be stronger than the Volker rule, which Obama and Geithner rejected.

This seems more like an example of the Obama administration's vindictive obsession with secrecy than their targeting of those who bring official crimes to light, though the distinction doesn't make them look much better.> Laura Poitras - An independent reporter who spent two years living with Iraqi Sunnis in 2004/5. She was detained and searched, perhaps invasively, at the border when returning to the U.S. but was never arrested or charged. Journalists and filmmakers being repeatedly (not just once) detained, searched and harassed by the state for their political views and activities is perfectly OK... so long as you're not charged with a (non-existent) crime?> John Kiriakou - Charged for outting CIA agents.CIA agents responsible for the torture of detainees, yeah. Kiriakou and Manning are both proof that exposing crimes is far more likely to end in criminal prosecution than actually committing them in the USA.> Julian Assange - Hasn't been charged, doubt he ever will be or NYT, etc. will have to be charged as well.If an indictment under the Espionage Act is the official response to people like Kiriakou, it goes without saying that Assange - who's exposed ten times what the others have combined - will be seeing something similar. To say an Assange prosecution would mandate indictment of the NYT (which [worked hand in hand with the White House to frame their coverage in a pro-war, pro-government light](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2010/jul2010/time-j28.shtml)) ignores that American law is now pretty nakedly political and arbitrary; the refusal to prosecute (or to hold to *any* standard of accountability) Bush administration officials and CIA operatives who now [publicly boast about their war crimes](http://www.salon.com/2012/04/25/crime_boasting_for_profit/) is a case in point.And all of this goes back to what I said about a political motivation. The only way you can claim most of these cases aren't instances of whistleblowing is if you're claiming the stuff that was exposed - like the CIA waterboarding somebody who was never accused of a crime 83 times - is perfectly OK, so much so that it needs to be hidden from a public that's too stupid to make up its own mind.> You should look up the history of Iran US relations, the kind of endorsement Obama got is extremely rare in that regard.Except it plainly wasn't an endorsement of Obama. It was an endorsement of a single statement *from* Obama urging diplomacy over war, in the context of an extremely punitive campaign (one that's always been backed with the threat of outright military aggression) against Iran.> You are ignoring the point that relocating these prisoners would have given them rights as they would be within US jurisdiction, the issue of geography is actually very important.Not so. Gitmo has been explicitly under US jurisdiction since 2004, when it came up in two key Supreme Court cases. Obama's 'relocation' plan was [overtly designed to maintain everything that made Gitmo such an international outrage,](http://www.salon.com/2012/07/23/the_obama_gitmo_myth/) including indefinite detention without charge. > As for indefinite detention, can you explain how Bush was able to indefinitely detain TWO US citizens before NDAA if it was Obama who enshrined it into law.The same way Obama legally justified his indefinite detention regime: claiming these vast powers were implicitly granted to the executive branch under the post-9/11 Authorization for the Use of Military Force. If you look back at the NDAA 'debate,' Obama initially opposed the detention provisions because it was detailing executive powers that he already claimed and exercised under the AUMF.> Please explain how is taking out banks from the student loan market, raising capital gains taxes on the super rich to pick just two examples a 'right wing class war agenda'.First, he didn't take the banks out of the student loan market. Sallie Mae, the banks and other private interests (especially those who service the massive federal loan program) are still making hefty profits on hundreds of billions in student debt. What you're talking about is a 2010 'reform' that ended federal subsidies for private loans... but to save the government money, not students, who are more fucked now than they've ever been.Second, Obama hasn't raised capital gains on the super-rich. He's *proposed* a marginal increase for 2013, to levels far lower than what we saw for most of the 20th century at that. And since it's a proposal, this is basically meaningless - the Democrats specialize in 'populist' pledges and rhetoric when it comes time to win an election (remember ""Hope and Change""? ""Main Street, not Wall Street""?) that's ditched not long after they come to power. The Democrats' extension of the Bush tax cuts - pretty blatantly reneging on a promise they'd be making for almost a decade - is a perfect example."
c5uhjc9,,">Making sentencing for one drug more in line with sentencing for another shows that Obama is applying drug war policy more consistently, not that he's fundamentally changing it.I can't even get my head around this - the guy corrects a racist policy which helps to release more than 12000 people, mostly minorities and you are making it out to be a BAD thing. I don't even know how to respond to this kind blatant disingenuousness."
c5uhnv2,,"Whether it's good or bad (who said it was bad?) isn't relevant to the point here. You offered this up as an example of how Obama has broken with the failed drug war paradigm, which flat out isn't true."

But we will not build permanent bases in this country, nor will we be patrolling its cities and mountains.

And why all the people were making a huge deal out of Obama's birth certificate, if he didn't have it he couldn't be pres. I think it makes sense why they made it that way at the founding, because you didn't want any loyalists or Brits becoming president, and it continued making sense when we became a world super power, to have an American running America. That being said I'm sure theres droves of people who aren't Native born who'd make better presidents than the ones we spit out.

This is a problem even the founding fathers warned against that arises when political parties come to be. If you can associate with a team, you can associate against one. The biggest problem in our country (and with the most recent elections) is that when it comes to the media (whether fox news, msnbc, cnn, or many papers/internet sources) there is an intentional effort on the part of executives and the editors they control to steer public opinion away from meaningful issues and toward divisive, frightening, and enraging distractions that boost ratings. These, from both sides, distract you from the fact that policies of Obama are ineffective or the budgets proposed by Romney and Ryan are dangerous for the future of America. Our country is built on greed, so it's not surprising that around half the population (conservative or not) is pissed they lose money to taxes, want to pay less, and want to make as much money as possible. But it's also a great point to make that when it comes to netting 6 million dollars in a year as opposed to 8, it's not socialism. Those two million dollars prevent the fights over money and groceries in my middle class home, prevent the bankruptcies and foreclosures because the middle class boosts the economy and therefore creates the jobs. Lower the middle class tax rate and everyone's happy. TL;DR: everyone's selfish; everyone needs to think more."

Republicans were elected to end the Korean War. The Republicans were elected to end the Vietnam War. There's a strong tradition of being anti-war, in the Republican Party. It is the constitutional position. It is the advice of the founders to follow a non-interventionist foreign policy. Stay out of entangling alliances. Be friends with countries. Negotiate and talk with them and trade with them. Just think of the tremendous improvement of relationships with Vietnam. We lost 60 thousand men. We came home in defeat. Now we go over there and we invest in Vietnam. So there's a lot of merit to the advice of the founders to follow the Constitution. And my argument is that we shouldn't go to war so carelessly.

c5uenuz,Fizjig,"I do not claim to be a Democrat, and I have been open minded to hearing ideas from Republicans. Here is the problem I run into. Many Republicans force feed their religious views into everything they do. At times they do this to the detriment of their own party, because frankly, many people who claim to have Christian values don't understand the concepts their own religion teaches. Paul's writings in the Bible, and the teachings of Jesus are not one and the same. There are fundamental differences between the two that contradict each other. Instead of understanding their faith and trying to come up with an educated opinion of their own on the subject, they choose to tow an ignorant party line that makes them sound like uneducated assholes. I believe, at their core people with Republican views have good intentions. I just feel that their party has become so extremist that it is hard to take anything they say at face value. Romney comes across as an Arrogant fuck that will lie, beg, cheat, steal, and sell your mother to win the election. Maybe that's not a fair view, but it is the reputation he has built in many peoples eyes. Even John McCain is like WTF is wrong with this guy. Instead of putting forth a decent candidate people on the Republican side are willing to vote for this clown simply, because he is not Obama. That's like gouging out your eyes, so that you don't have to wear glasses. If you want people to stop bashing your party then get some representatives in your party who are not batshit crazy, extremists. One more thing. Insulting the hell out of the people you are trying to convince to see your point of view is a terrible way of gaining support for your cause.

c5uff7r,Joseph_Kohl,Obama is doing the right thing to make sure that the Republican party loses more and more power. He still has more to do. He needs to increase social spending and government workers. 3 out of every 4 Americans need to be depending the federal government for a check. Either a paycheck or government assistance. The more people that want to continue recieving checks will only vote for the Democrats. The federal budget needs to about twice where it is today. This is the road to the next level of governmental control.

c5uh8o1,EasyTac,"This is actually an excellent critique of American politics. It's not perfect, but it's very good. The reason it's good is that it accurately characterizes a major component of the Republican party: Really rich people or corporations who want to use the government to protect their private wealth. I don't think anyone can dispute that that is a major component of the Republican party. Let's have a look though, just to be sure. Yay!The Republican party caters to these people in a number of ways. First, there are tax cuts. That puts money right back in their pockets. Of course, the sister to the tax cut is slashing the government. In the extreme case (read: Paul Ryan's wet dream) you get rid of any and all government functions that don't benefit the rich. That's a lot of government functions. Medicare, welfare, Pell grants, Social Security... On and on. It leaves you with what Milton Friedman (not necessarily a bad guy in my view) and Paul Ryan (are you serious?) are happy to inform you are the essential functions of government: more or less just basic infrastructure and the military. These things are percieved by the rich to benefit the rich, so they get to stay.Besides taxing and spending policy, another great way to protect wealthy interests is to ensure that their cash cows remain viable in the face of major changes to their business environment. The Koch Bros. are bank rolling Romney, and Harold Hamm is his top energy advisor. See where this is going? Fossil fuels are not a long term solution to our energy needs. Solar and wind energy are. Any forward thinking government would subsidize the hell out of this stuff so that we can meet our energy needs in the future. But that would amount to undermining the Koches's and Hamm's cash cows. It would mean that sooner rather than later, someone would replace those guys as America's energy tycoons. Instead of the really-rich-guy-because-he-owns-the-oil-company, we will someday have the really-rich-guy-because-he-owns-the-solar-company. Despite all of their money, the Koches and Harold Hamm are too stupid and lazy to try to become the really-rich-solar-guy, so instead they just bankroll and advise prominent Republicans in hopes that the energy revolution never takes place. It's a much more cost effective way to stay rich.The amazing thing about Romney is that it's all just become so fucking comically obvious with him. What's he running on? Whatever gets him votes. He didn't decide to run for president to ""Repeal and Replace Obamacare,"" *he invented Obamacare!* But he'll stand there with a sign that amounts to saying, ""My own program sucks, vote for me and I'll get rid of it"" because it gets him votes. A weaker man would crumble under the sheer hypocrisy. But not Mitt. Mitt's campaign must go on.So why is he really running? I think part of it is just good old fashioned egotism. This figures he should be president because he smartest and handsomest and his sperms only carry Y chromosomes. But the bigger part is to protect and serve whoever is wealthy *right now.* He's not helping out the future energy tycoons. He's helping out the current ones. And by getting rid of Pell grants, he's increasing the chances that any future energy tycoons will come from rich families. So when the day does come that the solar guy has more money than the oil guy, we can all rest easy that the social order didn't get shuffled too much in the process.TL:DR-- OP is right and here is why."

Liberalism) is almost achieved, so keep fighting for an indefinite amount of time.

It's even easy for them to get money for whatever they promise them, because all they need to do is cut education and make more of them. Of course Obama is letting all the illegal immigrants become citizens. They will vote for him and then have to pay taxes next year. What will they get?

But hey, isn't it great to feel on a rebel side? Isn't it great to feel like you're fighting the man? If your view is that the battle of ideals between democrats and republicans is solely the underclasses fighting the oppressive wealthy, then you are sorely misinformed and need to take some time and educate yourself of why sides promote monetary and political theories and how they have both helped and hindered in the past. Neither democrats nor republics theories are a coverall correct choice. Frustratingly, both sides only promote one idea or theory instead of promoting logical paths that should be taken in the present to address current situations. So I suggest that in the future, before you make such uneducated, blanket remarks, educate yourself without the bias of the media.TL;DR: Educate yourself before blanket statements.

That's what Mitt Romney and the Republicans intend to do."
c5ufqdh,zach1740,"How is Obama trying to do the right thing? I realize that he inherited a bad situation, but he has made it much worse than it needs to be. The stimulus bill only stimulated the deficit. Business confidence has continuously been low during his term. And then of course Obamacare will only worsen the health care situation by ushering in a new form of compulsory nanny statism that will alter our healthcare system in ways we cannot even begin to fathom. This has been a failed presidency. If Romney cared more about his bank accounts, then he wouldnt be spending a fortune trying to run for the presidency."
c5uhi9j,cr0ft,"Obama is a moderate conservative (who is a right-wing hawk as far as foreign policy goes - kill them all and take their resources). I sometimes wonder if Romney isn't expressly advanced as a candidate because he's so insane - it makes Obama look like the only choice, and certainly it keeps the polarized nonsense going so that no third-party candidates can sail up and disturb the status quo - just one party with two branches that wear slightly different clothing so it looks like people actually have a choice.Seriously... the president is just a figurehead.

He only tries to do the right thing when it's a relatively trivial issue that doesn't offend top contributors (banks, insurance companies) who keep him in office. It's just that he is a smooth enough talker to convince foolish Democrats he's really trying to fix the country and it's always the Republicans' fault."
c5udzg7,fantasyfest,Obamacare is a huge program that in time may get us to universal coverage. Do you think the Repubs would pass that? Do you call that trivial?
c5ue7ae,Inebriator,"Obamacare is a handout to insurance companies that also happens to help some people who can't afford insurance, but also hurt them because they can't afford insurance.There was going to at least be a clause that removed the anti-trust exemption for insurance companies, which would have sharply brought down health care costs, but the Dems mysteriously removed it the day before it was going to pass."

Aside from that, it is perfectly okay to only care about ones own wealth (monetarily and otherwise). No one has to be made to care about others, and they cannot be forced, attempting anything of the sort leads to resentment and a willingness to do all in their power to oppose and undo the acts of the others, again regardless of intention."
