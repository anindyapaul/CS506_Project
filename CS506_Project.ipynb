      ">I'll make gun to you, like you want me too\n",
      "> I don't have no time for you to be playing with my gun like this\n",
      "Yes, men and boys with guns. \n",
      "Stop deflecting. Guns are the issue here \n",
      "Other countries have men and boys too. You don't see them shooting people up. \n",
      "Let's be fair here: You have to imagine that without guns a lot of these deaths wouldn't have happened. More than a few of these people wouldn't have had the guts to try anything without a gun. So in effect the gun enabled the idiocy.\n",
      "Guns don’t kill people. [Girl Scouts kill people!](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/arizona-shooting-range-instructor-killed-girl-uzi-n189611)\n",
      "Every Society since the dawn of time, has tried to keep young males busy\n",
      "\n",
      "America should try its best to do the same \n",
      "With guns.\n",
      "It's a good thing abortion is legal then. Now we can \"ban\" those men and boys so that guns can live without fear.\n",
      "https://m.imgur.com/gallery/x1JQZ\n",
      "These shootings are mostly incidents of Narcissistic Rage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, Narcissism is a major problem for America (and the World) right now.\n",
      "Ya. No shit. It really isn’t that hard to think. Men and boys fought wars. For hundreds of years. Genetics would obviously choose for those who are able to kill. I mean think about it biologically. \n",
      "Mandatory mental health accessment before a firearm is purchased would screen out many potentially dangerous individuals.\n",
      "Ban them!\n",
      "Then maybe don't give them guns.\n",
      "Wow this one touched a nerve. I can’t tell if it’s because redditors are interpreting this article as an argument against gun control measures or if it’s because the headline suggests a problem that is exclusive to men. \n",
      "\n",
      "Either way, I don’t see how this is controversial. The US experiences disproportionately high rates of gun violence. Gun violence is disproportionately perpetrated by men (and men are also disproportionately the victims of it). We can work toward evidence-based restrictions on gun ownership while also discussing how to help American men. The latter issue is something that affects a multitude of other problems (and is a problem in itself!), so I don’t see the benefit in *not* approaching the topic in a logical yet compassionate way. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m female and have spent copious amounts of time on male-dominated internet communities and I can say with confidence that a lot y’all have some issues, and I don’t mean that in a cruel or judgmental way. There just seem to be an endless well of depression, anxiety, and social isolation felt by a lot of guys out there, especially young ones. Addressing it might be part of the puzzle to solving issues like gun violence, but it could simultaneously go a long way toward helping the majority - i.e., guys who are struggling would never hurt someone else. It's a win-win.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Men and boys with guns.\n",
      "Great... so stop selling AR 15's to men and boys.\n",
      "I dislike this sort of conflation of 'mental health' with 'lack of socialization'.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're not talking about people with brain damage or objectively characterizable conditions like schizophrenia here. We're talking about people whose primary damage is entirely a lack of social inclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is an uncomfortable truth that people really don't want to address because of what it implies: the problem isn't them, it's us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is trying to rid ourselves of 'toxic masculinity' a solution - it's actually part of the *problem*. The unwillingness to engage with the reality of how young men think and feel just means that you hasten the social exclusion that creates the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor are mental health professionals a panacea. Mental health professionals cannot provide the day-by-day, moment-by-moment social structure these young men need. Spending an hour with your therapist before being tossed out again on the streets doesn't fix what is, fundamentally, not a mental health but a *social* health problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "These young men need families and communities, not professionals.\n",
      "Those are some damn fine experts.\n",
      "Expert: noun, verb  [ ek-spurt] [ex-spurt]\n",
      "\n",
      "Ex: = a has been (example; He used to be a \"wannabe\" then became famous, and now he's just \"a has been\")\n",
      "\n",
      "Spurt: = a drip under pressure\n",
      "\n",
      "sounds about right\n",
      "Correction:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Guns, in the hands of men and boys, kill people**\n",
      "\n",
      "And project hate and and anger from further away and require less skill and knowledge to do it.\n"
