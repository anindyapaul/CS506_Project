dcot9s0,cantsay,I'm so tired of this sticky...
dcs6cl5,100LL,I've been downvoting the vast majority of these types of sticky comments. The sidebar exists for a fucking reason. Reddit and/or RES need to make it an option to show these.
dcotsdy,,[deleted]
dcotvpf,cantsay,because I've been on reddit almost ten years and this is a constant reminder of how much things have changed and how much we're all being treated like babies

dcors7h,Spenson89,Holy shit sensationalist media at its finest... they are probably just updating the website...
dcp8kv1,shipwalk,I upvoted because hope.
dcotg8x,kennyypowerss,Democracy is not governed by logic at times that will be its undoing.
dcoiq91,heyjew1,"This is the only mention of the word ""climate"" on the site now. >President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule.https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy"
dcojrrs,LawHawkling,Oh god
dcoodnv,OssiansFolly,> Waters of the U.S. rule.There it is! This is the rule that gave Army Corps Engineers oversight of the Dakota Access Pipeline...
dcopsq4,berryferry,Question: Wouldn't this be a conflict of interest for Trump? Doesn't he have money in the company doing the pipeline?
dcoqjv1,dogfluffy,He's literally using his own [Trump Hotel](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/trump-international-hotel-ethics.html) to host foreign diplomats and politicians. He doesn't seem to believe in conflicts of interest any more than climate change.
dcoqxhb,karmahunger,He doesn't have to; he can do what he wants because who's going to stop him? Shame? Decency? Morals? What happens when the president has none of those?
dcotziy,t3ht0ast3r,I too would like an answer to this. I used to naively believe that there was some independent ethical oversight body that held the president accountable for unconstitutional actions. Apparently I was mistaken.
dcoyenv,ZippyDan,"Strictly speaking, the Congress is that oversight body, with the ultimate power of impeachment. The problem is that the Congress is entirely R now, and they are so shocked, surprised, and tickled to have a President with an R beside his name as well, against all odds, that they will probably let him get away with murder, even though many of his policies are antithetical to the R platform, and many of his ideas and dealings are immoral and indefensible even to the *average* Republican."
dcp0hzx,Drewbdu,"You seem to forget that the Republican Party doesn't particularly agree with Trump on many key issues such as healthcare, immigration, foreign policy, and trade. Any vote of impeachment may be carried out with the Republican Congress at the helm, as Mike Pence is much more in line with the party's views."
dcp7kgo,G-man88,> Mike PenceChoosing him over Trump is like cutting your arm off because it's broken... Jesus this Trump presidency is getting worse by the minute.
dcp7u0o,Drewbdu,"I didn't say it was wise, but what I believe is most likely to happen."
dcp878z,G-man88,"Oh I know, I was just adding my commentary on how I feel about that. That man is distilled shit, Trump is the pure brand. Making Pence more potent of the two."
dcp8iqy,,Pence wouldn't start a nuclear war over twitter.
dcp9aa4,G-man88,"I dislike Trump as much as most, but I don't think he'd be stupid enough to start a nuclear war over twitter, saying that comes off as a little hyperbolic. Can we agree though that both are pure shit choices? This is a sad day for the US :("
dcouy0p,,[deleted]
dcovorn,t3ht0ast3r,So much of what I used to think were legal limitations on presidential power have actually turned out to be more like unenforceable guidelines.
dcoxwo4,thechapwholivesinit,He's still bound by the Constitution. Whether he is impeached for violating it is another story.
dcp0gjx,jackshafto,"When one party controls the Congress, the Courts and the White House they can do what they like and the Constitution be damned."
dcp4xi6,poorest_ferengi,"The Constitution is a piece of parchment, it has no intrinsic power other than that we agree it has. And the party solely in power doesn't have to give a shit about it unless we are willing to rise up and do something about that fact."
dcp0ep7,Drewbdu,"It's called Congress, and the next election if that fails. The Senate is already investigating Trump's ties to Russia, and they could easily expand the investigation to all business ties if need be.If the information they gain is damning, he may be impeached. If he is not, then his sentence will be carried out by the American public in 2020."
dcoqys6,AmbidextrousDyslexic,"Violence, that's what."
dcowvuo,captainredbeard135,"""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."" -JFK"
dcp1b92,KeystrokeCowboy,"The GOP is actively rigging the game to keep themselves in power by gerrymandering, voter suppression, fake news, and now blatant foreign interference. They consider any protestor paid off and are completely dismissive of any legitimate claims. Even when the Democrats bring up valid criticisms they are dismissed in the most childish of ways - you're just mad because you lost - kind of bullshit. They don't and won't give a shit until people start killing them or voting them out of office. And they are making it harder and harder to vote them out so what is left? Are we supposed to stand by and let them rob our country blind and sell it off to the highest bidder?"
dcp52qw,BinJLG,"I'm not so sure the GOP is the one rigging the whole thing ~~looking at you Koch Brothers~~, but they're definitely going along with it because it's in *their* best interests and fuck the people."

dcozzm3,flopsweater,Not likely. The second amendment folks are all in the right.

dcp108p,,[deleted]
dcp7cuw,buckett340,I asked one of my very right wing co-workers today why Obama forgot to come take my guns. This dude went out and got a loan so he could stock up on guns and ammunition back 2008.
dcpfrv4,Kayakprettykitty,"Thank you! Just because I am for women's rights and LGBT rights and other ""liberal"" ideas doesn't mean I care about how many guns you have! Don't point them at innocent people and we are all good. I would also like it if you had some basic gun safety training but, I realize that is just to make me feel better."
dcp7f92,G-man88,"I'm in the same boat, well libertarian at least, but I'm starting to sway towards the NRA because they insure your guns.....I could use that I gots lots of guns."

dcpccvq,karmahunger,"I'm on the left and support guns. I can't help but think with all their vehement opposition, people have kept their guns. If they didn't exist or were apathetic, the gov would have no problem weakening the second amendment."
dcp0b6p,jackshafto,They used to be all to the right. That may change.
dcp241f,DXent,No they're not
dcp347h,PencilvesterStallone,I am joining up. You would most likely call me a liberal.
dcp48wd,flopsweater,"Joining what? If you mean the military, most servicemembers hardly ever shoot."
dcp4v82,PencilvesterStallone,"No, not the military. The ranks of American liberals who own and are competent with a firearm."
dcos14m,karmahunger,I like this answer.
dcotak4,massive_cock,"Very rare to see such public and supported expressions of things like this, on major forums. When it happens, you know we have real problems. Things going seriously wrong."
dcovlwu,Contradiction11,And blaming the millions of angry citizens who *repeatedly are silenced in the usual routes* is not helping.
dcp0p4a,GAforTrump,"Like the people who criticized Obama were? Who is being silenced here? Has any liberal been ""silenced"" for their views in... The last 40 years?"
dcpcfhq,karmahunger,"Silenced in that despite speaking out, they do the opposite. From trying to repeal the ACA 5000 times to trying to make abortions a felony to being concerned with people's bathroom usage, they really seam to have nothing better to do."
dcotg11,alfredbester,Just a bunch of edgy twats that are too lazy to actually do anything. Losers.
dcoy9rx,jedi168,This guy is going off the cliff first

dcp74r3,AmbidextrousDyslexic,"Wow, ok. Great. Big tough guy here."
dcp7r2v,jeepdave,You brought up violence first Bucky. Just saying we didn't like Obama but we didn't go out burning up cities and rioting in the streets. Y'all don't want a war with us.
dcpcli1,karmahunger,"Obama had class, understanding, and had to work through an opposition at everything he tried to do. He's not perfect, but a least he's not a man child who's single focus is profits and is against science, progress, and the people."
dcpn0mt,jeepdave,Obama was a child. Period. Luckily he will just be a footnote. History will not look back kindly at his presidency.
dcq62a8,bobthecookie,"You can't seriously believe he'll be a footnote. I mean, he's our first black president, that's a pretty big deal. Even if you didn't support him, you can not actively be an idiot. Though you're talking as if the only people with jobs/responsibilities are Trump supporters so you can't be too smart."
dcov7em,MontiBurns,Congress!... Oh wait
dcowb0j,luckeybarry,"The law, many people have thought they are above it until it's too late."
dcoxisl,,"Conflicts of interest are impeachable. So, >who's going to stop himHopefully the Senate. Senate is 46D/52R/2I (who both favor democrats) so it's not a completely lost cause. A lot of them don't like Trump either and would much rather have Pence."
dcp1bb1,eoliveri,"Let's hope that voters return control of Congress to the Democrats in 2018, so that impeachment can be seriously considered."
dcp169k,RufusYoakum,That moment when a statist realizes that the government is not your friend.

dcpiy88,rajdon,That's called corruption in most of the rest of the world and is illegal. Not in the US though maybe. I mean the whole campaign is pretty much a conflict of interest race.
dcts0u0,ledditaccountxd,You do understand that checks and balances exist in the US?
dcotv7h,,[deleted]
dcovf5u,drinkthatkoolaid,It still doesn't make it ethically sound to have a conflict of interest.
dcovnio,rasa2013,And that makes his behavior okay how?
dcovkma,goob3r11,Just something else he has pointed out that needs to be changed.
dcowd2k,Dingus-ate-your-baby,It's like people never even heard the word Halliburton.
dcoyuw3,,"The fact is:he got elected. Whine as much as you want, but the people have spoken, and he has a mandate.If you have some of that extra salt, i'll use it for my Col. Bernie Sander's chicken tenders, please."
dcp2b0p,karmahunger,He got elected due in part to gerrymandering and voter suppression. The Republicans are afraid of a fair election so they have to rig it to their advantage.
dcotgn1,sianegad,"It serves his interests perfectly, no conflict!"
dcoyd3a,titomcfly,"His direct quote on conflicts of interests was something along the lines of, ""I can't believe how few rules there really are!"" Whether he's misinformed or not it's undeniably classless and un-presidential to not take the numerous conflicts of interest he has into account."
dcovk7t,yumyumgivemesome,"At which point does this become impeachable? I'm not saying the republican Congress will do it, but a swing of power in 2 years could bring in some ambitious do-gooders."
dcp2991,Man-Bear-Sloth,So what's the impeachment process again?
dcowudx,x-Z-x,As the devil's advocate he did **claim** he's donating all income from foreign governments to the US Treasury
dcp277f,NinjaRobotPilot,Which is also illegal.
dcoznlj,StardustOasis,I don't think he understands what a conflict of interest is and why it's an issue.
dcoy6ug,thebumm,But that's where a lot of Presidents have hosted the same people. That isn't a change or nearly as concerning as DAPL involvement.
dcp134v,emperormax,Conflict of interest for Trump = Disagreeing with Melania over what to watch on TV
dcpft89,SwanS0ng,"I don't even know why I'm going to jump in here and take the downvotes, but he literally said all foreign profits at his hotels will be given to the U.S. Treasury.http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-trump-plans-to-donate-hotel-profits-1484154101-htmlstory.html"
dcotemj,alfredbester,He's donating all the proceeds to the U.S. Treasury.
dcov48m,lumixter,"No he's donating all his ""profits"" which doesn't really mean shit."
dcoy0zx,Bogaragaraga,Why have profits that can be taxed when you can have losses?
dcp8n1p,riking27,This is illegal BTW
dcotown,ninjanick95,"This is true, though he made it out to be some big, generous move on his part rather than the proper course of action. Any money paid to the Trump Hotel by foreign officials will be directed to the Treasury."
dcouwqk,SympatheticGuy,Didn't he just say the profits would? So I'm sure overheads are like 98%
dcov1oc,,[deleted]
dcovrkn,BaggerX,"If we're discarding ethics as something we at least attempt to require of our government officials, then we're already well and truly fucked.The hotel is just one of many conflicts Trump has. His debts are the thing I'm much more concerned about."

dcovdjx,dogfluffy,"""Brought to you by Carl's Jr.""It's a great way to make money."
dcoxrm9,Electric_Cat,As if it's not funding his own business still
dcou2sl,underwaterpizza,It's his impeachment then :D
dcoyzn9,,In what way does this hurt our country? They don't have to pay for overpriced rooms around DC?
dcoxalx,TheBlackStag2,He's donating hotel money from diplomats to the treasury. Does no one even listen to him? Jesus. At least give him a chance to keep his word before judging him.
dcoxspd,CheMxDawG,So what? He can't room people in his own property? Do they need to stay at a Motel 6? What's your point?
dcp51uq,Swie,"That it's a conflict of interest when the guy who owns a hotel gets to choose which hotel the diplomats are staying at. Even if the money they pay to stay there doesn't go directly into his pocket, his hotel gains prestige and business and he benefits from it indirectly.These aren't his personal friends he is personally hosting..."
dcp5a3f,CheMxDawG,"He can host it wherever he wants, there's no logical reason to tell him where can meet with diplomats and politicians.What if a diplomat or politician requests to meet at a Trump property? Is that a conflict of interest?You're point doesn't make sense."
dcowkxx,gettingassy,Did you not pay attention to his press conference where they went over all the ways he was extracting himself from COI's like you just mentioned? All payments from foreign diplomats staying at his hotels are going into the treasury
dcoz0g2,xPolicies,So you'd rather pay these clowns using your taxes than have him pay for it himself? Or am I missing somethig
dcoz18q,Captain-Euphoria,"He's putting all the profits from his hotel into the treasury, don't send out half truths"
dcozgrp,,He also using the money (because they still pay for the rooms) and putting it into the Treasury.....so think about that.
dcp2vaq,mrherbiejay,Which he has said ANY MONEY ACQUIRED THROUGH SUCH HOTEL RESERVATIONS of foreign diplomats and politicians WILL BE DONATED TO THE TREASURY OF THE U.S.A.
dcp4b5i,xPolicies,"But apparently that, too, is a problem. Damned if he does, damned if he don't."
dcp981a,velvetycross54,He's also donating all the money spent by foreign governments in his hotels to the US Treasury. https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/4631595/donald-trump-hotels-treasury-foreign-government/%3fsource=dam
dcpbpqf,SiLiZ,"Let's look at it from a different angle. Hypothetically... What if because it is his hotel, he lowers the cost of their stay across the board? He makes a much smaller profit, if any, for these stays, but effectively reduces the overall lodging expenses of our own and other visiting countries government officials, politicians, diplomats, ambassadors, etc... Sure, you can chalk it up to conflict of interest and make a stink about it. But if the overall result reduces government spending for mandatory travel, what's wrong with that? Would you rather they spend an extra $300-$2000 per night of US tax dollars going with a different Hotel?"
dcpe25y,portrait_fusion,if no one will do anything about it; what reason would he care?
dcoq2rd,OhioTry,"He absolutely does. Also, if the Trump administration makes it clear that peaceful protests will not stop the pipeline the protests won't stay peaceful!"

dcp4uxo,nanou_2,"My god, I can just fucking see it. Christ."
dcp6tgt,Silidon,He might want to withhold judgment on that front.
dcowdz8,,"That's a great way to put it. I've been trying to explain to people for a while that the advent of peaceful protests did not suddenly render every other kind obsolete. In fact it is trivial for someone like Trump to render peaceful protests obsolete by not giving a shit, and then prosecuting protesters just for sport."
dcox54r,BC441,"I was thinking more along the lines of people getting upset over the violent protests (aka riots) but also at the people just holding signs. What, are we expected to just stay quiet? No protest is good protest? But I don't think your wrong though, and you do make a good point."
dcouit2,Fourseventy,He knows from experience...
dcouvou,nidrach,">Stop quoting laws, we carry weapons!-Pompey the Great"
dcp0rhe,atomicxblue,I watched a documentary this morning on Al Jazeera about the Hong Kong independence movement. They started out with a nonviolent protest but turned ugly quick once the police brought out the pepper spray.

dcp8lmv,BC441,"Again, it's more about protests. Just swap revolution with protest and it all comes together."
dcowz5y,yesbutnowoah,Is this coming from the same guy who had his brother appointed attorney general? Surely you aren't implying a double standard? What's good for the geese is good for the gander.

dcoxtgi,BC441,"Well, I've seen the quote used with revolution replaced with protest. Basically, if you constantly tell peaceful protesters that they're being a nuisance or in general ""shut up and f*** off"" you shouldn't be surprised when people start busting windows and lighting fires."
dcoytx3,PANTS_ARE_STUPID,"We hear you, we just don't care."
dcoz5gm,BC441,"Well, then don't ask why people are rioting in DC."
dcozcw8,PANTS_ARE_STUPID,"They think shouting louder will make us care.It won't. It's just annoying. It makes us dislike you, you whining babies. You can't have your way just because you stomp your feet. Welcome to how the real world works."
dcp00yc,BC441,"That's where you're wrong. Plenty of protest have gotten things done. Look at the pipeline, or the lack there of I guess. Or Vietnam war protests. It's more than stomping feet and temper tantrums, it's democracy running its course. If elected officials and their decisions do not meet the people's standards, they protest. When people try to silence the protest, the protest only gets louder. A group of devoted people can get anything accomplished. Look at this election for example. Against all odds Trump won. Disgruntled Americans, in a pseudo protest of the establishment elected a man building his entire political brand on being anti establishment. Hopeful, angry people can create change. That's how the real world works"
dcp06nb,PANTS_ARE_STUPID,"I think you just don't understand what you're starting here. These events are way past ""protests"" now. Any time you take it up a notch to rioting, it becomes something different.You want a civil war? That's how you start a civil war."
dcp0kfm,ezekrialase,"Good, if people aren't allowed to voice their protests peacefully, or they are ignored and treated like dirt they have the duty to escalate their protests until they are taken seriously. I'd much rather have people voice their problems then helplessly ignore them and do nothing."
dcp0ocq,PANTS_ARE_STUPID,"Alright, well, your guys would get stomped in a war, so I hope it doesn't come to that."
dcp12vb,ezekrialase,"Lol really? If you don't follow orders like a good sheep and try to change things, we'll go to war and destroy you? That bull headed, aggressive stupidity against your own citizens is more like a brutal totalitarian dictatorship then a democracy"
dcp1brh,PANTS_ARE_STUPID,"You're the ones rioting, attacking people, starting fires in the streets, burning cars, and wreaking havoc. How long do you think it will take people to fight back if you keep it up? Not directed by the military or the government or any ""totalitarian dictatorship"", though I note that you went straight to that extreme. I never brought that up, *you did*. I'm talking about the people getting attacked. How much bullshit do you think they'll take before they snap back?"
dcp1y1i,BC441,"When people are rioting, you try and address the problem. Until the problems are addressed, the people will riot. If force is used to disperse the riot, you just make more people angry and then a bigger riot happens later. It's a feedback loop. Instead of telling them to stop, show them why they shouldn't be worried."
dcp24fg,PANTS_ARE_STUPID,"No.We do not negotiate with terrorists.In a democracy, you get to vote, and you get to protest, but you **do not get to riot to make your point.** Rioters get arrested and put in jail. If you want changes, you have to do it the same way everyone else has to; by voting, by calling your representatives, and by joining political movements.Riots are just temper tantrums from a bunch of toddlers who needed more discipline when they were growing up. They'll run a few laps around the city then tire out, or get so enraged they wind up in prison.Either way, they'll go away because they still haven't figured out that the only way to get real change is to work for change from within the system."
dcp1095,BC441,"Well, if we think about this liberals control most industrial areas while mainly rural areas are conservative. That and it would more than likely be gorilla warfare in large cities and as we've learned from the Middle East it takes a door to door sweep to clean places out, and there are a LOT of doors in Chicago so start looking."
dcoynpk,bagel-master,You would be surprised if you live in a democracy governed by laws. Just because people don't listen to your protests/whining does not make it on to become violent. This a nation of laws and everyone has to respect them or suffer consequences.
dcoz753,Sharlach,"It's also supposed to be a democracy, and you can't just ignore the will of the majority of the population without repercussions. Laws can be changed anytime by those in power, but that doesn't mean that they have to be accepted without question."
dcozbks,bagel-master,Well if you live the US it's a republic so really we don't get a direct say in government. We elect officials who make those specific calls for us. And we don't like them we elect new ones. Either way setting shit on fire is not ok under 99% of circumstances.
dcp0ta0,ezekrialase,"I agree that setting things on fire and violent protests that hurt innocent people are not right, but if people are peacefully trying to voice their displeasure at the way things are and are then treated like shit and ignored, they have to change right?"
dcp40po,Sharlach,"I agree that it's not right, but protesters aren't a single monolithic group and blaming all of them for the actions of a few is dishonest. On top of that, it's also Trump's responsibility as President to reach across the aisle, represent ALL Americans, and unite the country. If his plan is to just ignore the majority for the next four years and constantly antagonize them then riots are only going to get more common and will be the least of our problems."
dcp9j9f,PANTS_ARE_STUPID,"""If you don't give us our way, we're just going to stomp our feet harder!""Go on, then. You're responsible for your own actions, if that's how you want to behave, then go ahead. We'll treat you accordingly."
dcpb847,Sharlach,"And the President is responsible for his, and like I said before, you can't just ignore the will of the majority and expect nothing to happen. Your dismissive attitude is exactly the kind of reaction that will divide this country further. When Obama became President, he still tried to work with his opponents and didn't actively ignore the constituents that didn't vote for him. If Trump can't do that as well then it's a major failure on his part and he'll be directly responsible for when things go to shit."
dcpeih6,PANTS_ARE_STUPID,"No, the people directly responsible are the people committing acts of violence.Do you disavow the violent rioters?"
dcpeltk,Sharlach,"No what, exactly? You don't believe the President has a duty to represent all Americans and listen to the voting majority?"
dcpfnpw,PANTS_ARE_STUPID,"No, the President is not responsible for someone else's actions. Take personal responsibility! It's not normal to resort to violence.But I noticed you dodged the question; do you disavow the violent rioters?"
dcpg0af,Sharlach,"Go back and reread my posts, I never disagreed with personal responsibility. What I said was that the President has an obligation to the entire country, and that if he doesn't consider the will of the majority of the population in his decisions, those people will choose to act against him and his administration in a variety of ways. He's not a private citizen anymore, the whole country rests on his shoulders now. If he didn't want this responsibility then he shouldn't have ran for President. And I'm not advocating for violent resistance myself, but some people will have no trouble taking things there if they feel ignored. Acknowledging that doesn't mean I side with them.But why should I disavow anything in the first place? You're the one preaching personal responsibility here, and yet you want me to speak for a group I have nothing to do with? The vast majority of protesters are peaceful and I fully support their first amendment rights. I'm not going to condemn a whole movement because a small subset of people choose to act out."
dcpg88l,PANTS_ARE_STUPID,"The President has a responsibility to Americans. If groups of people want to set themselves aside as distinctly anti-American, then that's fine, they're declaring war and will be dealt with appropriately. You're either an American with American values, or an enemy there to infiltrate and divide. He has a responsibility to Americans, not seditionist treasonous fucks."
dcpgl6i,Sharlach,"Most actual Americans didn't vote for him. And now you're the one advocating violence. So which is it, is violence acceptable or not? If you start labeling American citizens as ""anti-American"" just because you disagree with their ideas, and then declare war on them and try to violently oppress them, you can't possibly expect them to just sit there and take it. He's President now, he won! remember? He does, in fact, have the power to start a civil war, but is that the goal here? if not, then it's important to discuss policy in good faith. Everyone that lives in this country is entitled to a seat at the table and for them to be taken seriously. Like I said earlier, treating the majority of the country with disdain and ignoring them will only serve to further divide us and make things worse."
dcpgz24,PANTS_ARE_STUPID,"Oh my god, ""muh popular vote"". Seriously, get over it. It means nothing. And excuse me? I sure as fuck didn't advocate violence. I mean, they'd goddamn well deserve it, but that's not how things are done. > If you start labeling American citizens as ""anti-American"" just because you disagree with their ideasNo no no, you will not pull that shit here. It's not for what they believe, it's for how they behave. You *behave* like a violent thug, you will get treated like a violent thug. You're allowed to believe whatever the fuck you want. You don't see me standing around outside people's homes who I disagree with, chanting at them, carrying flags, breaking windows and burning shit. No. You can believe what you want. But the moment that turns into acts of violence, there is *zero tolerance*. At that point, you have established yourself as someone unreasonable, violent, and deserving of being locked away. > then declare war on them and try to violently oppress them, you can't possibly expect them to just sit there and take it.Who is declaring war on who? We *voted*, that's our right in a democratic country. If you choose not to acknowledge reality, *that's on you*. You don't get to just stomp your feet and subvert the will of the voting public. ""But muh popular vote.""If you wanted to win the Presidency, you should have won the vote that matters. Everyone is sick of your bullshit. It's over. You're done. Sit the fuck down and learn to behave in a civilised, polite society. > Like I said earlier, treating the majority of the country with disdain and ignoring them will only serve to further divide us and make things worse.What disdain? He's opening his arms out wide to them; he's clearly saying IF YOU ARE AMERICAN, YOU ARE WITH ME. That's **all** Americans. Who would possibly have a problem with that? If you are American, which you are by right of being born there or migrating there legally, then he will fight for you. What more could he possibly offer?He'll never pander to your bullshit leftie talking points, so you can't expect that. He's about rising *above* identity politics and uniting under one identity; that of **American**. He's drawing the lines between American and anti-American. Division based on lines of gender, race, or whatever else.. that's the shit that harms us as a group. Unite with a common goal of patriotism and the only people who lose are those directly opposed to our success. Everyone had their chance to vote, to be heard. Now you have to get on with forging the kind of future that you want, within the parameters that you're given. That's what winners do."
dcph564,Sharlach,"I'm not questioning his legitimacy as president at all. In fact, I clearly acknowledged he won in my previous post. What I'm saying is that he doesn't have a political mandate and can't make decisions unilaterally without risking further division and being a one term President. Also; wow, chill out dude. Triggered snowflake much? Your behavior and hostility is exactly the attitude that's feeding this dissent. You want people to work with this administration instead of opposing it, then maybe you should start by learning to discuss things calmly."
dcph8gr,PANTS_ARE_STUPID,"He has all of the Republicans on his side, as the Democrats have consistently lost all their seats over the last 8 years. I'd say that's a mandate.You're welcome to disagree.I'm not triggered, I'm high energy. I won't let bullshit stand undefended. If you can't understand the difference between attacking *you* and attacking *your argument*, again, that's on you not me. Note: you didn't actually offer any arguments against anything I've said."
dcphitm,Sharlach,"No, a mandate is a very specific term that refers to how much of a country voted for a president and their policies. If you don't have popular support, you don't have a mandate. Having the power to do something and having a mandate to do something is very different. Going against the will of the majority will have consequences. And I didn't respond to your argument because you don't have one, and I'm not interested in talking to a hostile triggered sore winner. You've also completely missed the mark with your whole ""lefties talking point"" rant. This isn't about identity politics or PC culture, this is about policy and the direction of the country. The people protesting this weekend don't care about what is and isn't ""American."" That's entirely your obsession. What they care about are things like equal rights, climate change, not completely gutting our nations institutions, not getting into a trade war, etc. so long as Trump's policies go in that direction, he will be met with fierce resistance."
dcphuwl,PANTS_ARE_STUPID,"Well those are literally the platform he ran on, that the people voted in, so bad luck to you guys."
dcpujbu,Sharlach,"Once again, the people voted against him. You can dangle your victory over us all you want, and he clearly has the power to enact his policies, but saying that ""the people"" wanted this is factually incorrect."
dcozcip,BC441,"There is a difference between not listening and going out of your way to be at odds with protesters. Not listening is fine. Hell, most people don't listen. It's the guys that yell and scream and fight with the protestors that make violence inevitable."

That you advocated for the use of violence over a pipeline that has religious importance to a very small group of people.It's my guess that the Conservative Christians will be the ones that perpetrate violence in the future after being driven into a corner. Just remember... that when they do this... YOU said it was okay.
dcoxdxz,ForYourSorrows,"I didn't say violence was okay Carte blanche and I don't give a shit about the pipeline. What I said was that sometimes violence is necessary. What's funny is that people who say ""violence is never the answer"" and things like that can only say that because violence (or the threat of it) holds our society together."

But the Sioux, as I understand it, have a religious objection to the current pipeline route because it goes through one of their burial mounds. Where religion is involved people don't just accept defeat quietly. That's a reality that the US government and the corporations involved with the pipeline have to accept and work around- by rerouting the pipeline.

It is impossible for him to have a conflict of interest, because his interest is the country's interest. So, hopefully you'll sleep better now, knowing that he can't have a conflict of interest."
dcortfx,RagingCajun3195,"He sold the shares he had, he did that long ago. I'm fairly certain he did that before he even got the Republican nomination.

dcoyvfa,Gatazkar,It's not your fault for being sexually assaulted then? /s.
dcp2dmp,adamd22,"No, it's the assaulter. Are you suggesting there is something wrong with that statement? That the burden is on the victim to stop the assaulter breaking the law, rather than the criminal for breaking the law in the first place?"
dcp2kat,Gatazkar,"No, I'm saying the original comment of ""letting"" someone commit sexual assault was ridiculous. I'm making a joke of it, the /s is there for sarcasm. EDIT: I think we're arguing the same thing, the reason I'm talking about robbery is that regardless of whether or not you did something to actively and cognizantly obstruct the crime it is still by definition a crime; that's like that bullshit statement ""you can't rape your spouse,"" it doesn't matter if their drunk, coerced, or misinformed, assault is still assault."

dcou5tw,PinkysAvenger,It really speaks volumes about you that you think only women can be sexually assaulted
dcoueyi,TonsOfSalt,"Nobody said sexual assault only applies to women, but the context of this discussion is about allegations surrounding Trump and women."
dcorblm,WhyDontJewStay,"If consent is illicitated while the victim is under duress, pretty sure that is assault. Or if a boss grabs his (or her) secretary ""by the pussy (or dick)"" and she (or he), the secretary, doesn't express clear non-consent for fear of losing her (or his) job. I would consider that sexual assault as well."
dcoth6f,TonsOfSalt,"Duress is subjective, and we're officially in an age where *college students* needed a [group ""cry-in""](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/11/09/colleges-try-to-comfort-students-upset-by-trump-victory/) including therapy with play-doh and coloring books. This level of subjective fragility over an *election result* makes me laugh. I can only imagine how they'd describe a generic sexual advance.I understand the notion of ""duress"" and can think of legitimate circumstances where it universally applies, like an immediate threat of bodily harm. That being said, Trump was merely talking about ""being a star"" and how women let you do it when you're one. The only possible way to interpret it as an ""assault"" is to invent a situation of subjectivity where his 'stardom' managed to put someone into duress. To think that merely being a star would cause women to be unable to say *no* really just tells me that the person making the argument has a low opinion about the capability of a woman to speak her mind."
dcoyfnj,GrilledCyan,"So your argument is that women being under duress means nothing because that word can also be used to describe college students needing a supportive place to deal with their emotions?Fuck that noise. That's a separate discussion to be had. The tape shows that Donald Trump has actively taken advantage of his position of power, as a rich man, as a television star, etc. To make sexual contact with women as he sees fit. Donald threatens to sue people who say unflattering things about him. Fighting back against him is pretty much guaranteed to get some kind of lashing out from him based on his very public record of doing so.If I was a woman in business or television, I'd be scared to death of Donald Trump if he were attempting to touch me sexually. Because I'd have to risk losing my job and my livelihood to a man child with a team of expensive lawyers. So of course I'd ""let"" him do it, because the consequences of not letting him do it are crystal clear to me."

dcp6scy,WhyDontJewStay,"Everything is subjective. That's how conventional reality works.

I understand what you are arguing against, but it doesn't really have anything to do with my comment. I am in absolutely no way an SJW of any sort.

Bernie did better against Trump - every fucking poll showed that. Why do you think DWS had to resign? Why do you think her interim successor Donna Brazile gave the debate questions to the Clinton campaign before the debate against Bernie? The game was rigged.And then there was this: http://www.salon.com/2016/11/09/the-hillary-clinton-campaign-intentionally-created-donald-trump-with-its-pied-piper-strategy/ Clinton *wanted* to run against Trump, he was her dream opponent. The crook used her influence to help getting him to the top, because she was such a fucking terrible candidate that she couldn't win against all the other weak Republican candidates. But guess what? She couldn't even beat Trump who had a new scandal about every other week.And yet there you are: ""BUT HER EMAILS hehe"" No, she lost because she is Hillary Clinton."
dcopg12,californianion,"Goddamn, fuck off with that poor wittle victim Clinton bs. She made her bed and thought that it wouldn't sink her and she was wrong. Her judgment sucks and so does the American people's but she is in no way a victim of anyone except maybe Bill."
dcoq5al,jiggatron69,The fact that if I leave off a /s and people lose their minds is actually funnier.
dcoq92a,californianion,"""But her e-mails"" is the laziest and least effective takeaway as to why this election was lost."
dcoqhle,jiggatron69,appreciate humor for what it is son. The day is already terrible enough as it is.
dcoqq09,californianion,"Love you, Dad."
dcoqrei,jiggatron69,Dont forget to poop.
dcoqlq2,wenteriscoming,Look at the poll numbers before and after Comey released that last little tidbit of information. Yeah...
dcoqpfr,californianion,I am well aware. I was already nervous as fuck before Comey because it was way too close and Clinton wasn't pulling away even after all the sexual assault shit. There were 100 different things which could have caused polls to tighten when people are so lukewarm about the Dem candidate and she has trustworthiness polls **below** her pathologically lying opponent.
dcopjc0,Teethpasta,I mean if she was held to the same standard as Snowden or Chelsea Manning she should be in prison..... But let's not talk about the atrocities of Obama or try to be at all consistent.
dcopnpr,Realhuman221,And Trump has done enough illegal things to put him in jail even longer.
dcoqy5o,Teethpasta,I'm sure Trump is pretty evil and at the very least a convicted con artist. I'm just tired of people down playing how much of a shithead Hilary is. Honestly she got what she deserved. Someone better should have been running.
dcopwjo,AliasHandler,"No, because she did not intentionally leak any classified info, nor did she have gross negligence in handling classified info."
dcoqujl,Teethpasta,That's up to interpretation
dcoqw1q,AliasHandler,And the FBI determined that to be the case. So I'm not sure what more you want.
dcor3yb,Teethpasta,Because there are separate rules for the elite.
dcorm29,adamd22,"No because the law literally specifically mentions ""intended malice"" when it comes to document and email security, and Clinton's situation was just plain stupidity, which isn't illegal."
dcp0hs7,Teethpasta,Except for when she tried to hide it. That was pretty intentional
dcorgob,wendell-t-stamps,The FBI's interpretation.
dcopxsh,chutneyandriceplz,"Clinton deliberately stole and published thousands of classified documents?Oh wait. No. That's not a bad analogy, that's a lie."
dcoqt2i,Teethpasta,Taking them off an secured server and putting them on an unsecured one basically accomplishes the same thing.
dcoqvtu,chutneyandriceplz,"No it isn't. If it was, she would have been prosecuted.Funny how different words mean different things, huh?"
dcor59x,Teethpasta,No what's funny is how obvious it is there are separate rules for the elite.
dcorab6,chutneyandriceplz,"Maybe, but that isn't illustrated here. Clinton didn't do what Snowden or Manning did. Not even close. She didn't get prosecuted like them because she didn't commit the crime that they did."
dcopj8l,,"""Wipe what, like with a cloth?"" - Hillary Clinton, falsely assuming the country will laugh along with her.Whether or not you think the emails were a big deal, the way she handled it was not spectacular."
dcopwiw,chutneyandriceplz,"Yeah, that quote shows about 1% of the tactlessness of about 1,000 separate Trump quotes."
dcoqeei,,"The context matters though, Trump never said anything like that while being interviewed in an investigation. It completely contributed to the idea that Hillary was 'above' the people."
dcor4eo,chutneyandriceplz,http://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/house-tours/g3501/donald-trump-penthouse/What was that you were saying?
dcoqf5p,yeswenarcan,"For me (someone who voted for her because Trump is 1000x worse) that quote would have had me voting for just about anyone else if the alternative hadn't been Trump. It's not tactless (I mean, it is, but...). It's condescending playing dumb bullshit when asked about something that was absolutely a big deal. For someone with her intelligence and experience to try to get away with acting like she doesn't know what it means to wipe a server is absolutely infuriating."
dcor3aj,chutneyandriceplz,"Dude. Pick any of the 100x quotes/scandals associated with Trump. They'are all worse. Way worse. And there are dozens and dozens more of them. If Clinton is 'x' far away from being the ideal candidate, Trump is 1000x. Clinton did nothing wrong other than get shit on by Republicans/sexists for 25 years. Imagine if every email Trump and his team had ever sent became public. Imagine if they had been subject to the investigations and congressional hearings, decade after decade, and the shit that would have come out of it.Clinton is not perfect. Her email server caused zero damage (feel free to show me I'm wrong here), except to her campaign. She would have been a competent president."
dcotc4l,yeswenarcan,">Clinton did nothing wrong>Clinton is not perfectPick one. I already acknowledged that Trump is 1000x worse. That's why I voted for Hilary. But running against Trump doesn't magically assuage Clinton of her sins. If you're willfully ignorant of Hilary's major problems as a candidate or want to blame them all on the Right, you're part of what got the Democratic party in their current position. While there's more to it than this, to at least some extent Trump won because Clinton was just that flawed of a candidate.I'm not sure if the emails caused any actual damage. I don't think there's been any clear reports of any, although they would likely be classified. The bigger issue for me is why she was using a private server, and I think the most plausible explanation is that it was an attempt to skirt FOIA, which makes me wonder what she was emailing about as SOS that she wanted to hide from the American public.Edit: I agree that she would have been a competent president, it's her ethics I take issue with. Unfortunately the new administration has neither."
dcotu9j,chutneyandriceplz,"I think Clinton lacked charisma. I think Clinton had a wonderful platform and a track record of competence, and I trusted her to lead our country in the right direction.Her 'major problems':Benghazi - BupkisForeign Influence - No wrongdoing on her part. Before you say Russian Uranium, keep in mind that was a decision that wasn't made just by Hillary, but several other government agencies, as well as other foreign governments, including Canada. If she's culpable, so are they. Bupkis.Emails: We both agree there were no actual damage. All you have is your speculation that she was generally trying to hide something (something that other people in her position have done). Bupkis. Trump won because the American people are stupid, racist, and sexist. Fortunately, over the next 10-20 years the majority of his base will be dead."

dcoslod,Tman1027,"I think there is a consensus that it will have catastrophic consequences. These are only predictions, so nothing is sure, but the increase in droughts and hurricanes we have been seeing lately are really just the beginning. The issue with these isn't extinction of the human race, but mass displacement and extinction of other species."
dcosrd0,Florac,"> Climate change models literally change every year and often contradict previous data.True, but more often than not, the new models look worse than the previous once. Yes, we can't say exactly what will happen. But generally, we can say with fairly high certainty that many bad things will happen because of it such as increase in global sea levels and severe droughts in some of the warmer areas of the world.> While I agree industry causes a bulk majority, I would also think that humans, who generate co2 through respiration, also add to the problemYes, it does add a bit. But not as significantly as industry. After a quick google search, I found it it contributes around 7% of global emissions. So whil still a big factor, nowhere near to what industry generates. And making industry more eco-friendly is a lot easier than than controlling global population. People might complain if they have to pay money for something. But I'm fairly sure they would be pissed if the government tells them ""You can't have kids""."
dcouh6p,Paranoidexboyfriend,Doesn't the amount of industry needed increase with population as well?
dcoulx7,Florac,"That is a good point. But imo, even with that increase, if all industries were made to be more eco-friendly, that effect wouldn't be significant until far in the future."

And that rising sea levels are bad if you happen to live near current sea level? A-Are you joking? The part you take issue with is the one that you can observe for yourself right now by stacking ice cubes in a cup full of water? Because we kinda have a clue that that's going to happen. And a lot of people are going to die as a result of it. And even more people are going to be displaced as a result of it. >Also, why doesn't anyone talk about how the global population directly correlates with an increase in global temperature averages?Because it... *doesn't*?

I'm torn between the ""I told you so"" feeling of hoping that they ""learn"" something from this, which is an ugly feeling, and what I know is right, which is that we should have compassion for everyone.edit: to expand -- Thank you for challenging my statement. I think the reason for my conflict is that I'm balancing the short and long term views. In the short term, a lot of people are going to suffer under Trump, and that's probably going to be his voters most of all. I live in California and I'll be fine. But will Kentucky folks be okay without Kynect? I'm not sure. But in the long term, I wonder if the Trump presidency will reveal to some of the people who voted for him that facts, norms, and institutions really do matter. That good governance matters. And maybe we'll be able to come together on some of the issues I care about, but I'm not sure that would be possible without the reality check that suffering under Trump is going to deliver."

dcp61k6,Red_Carrot,"Let's drop this whole snowflakes thing. It was a stupid insult that the republicans came up with and it is just bad in general. But you are right, I had friends posting they would not vote for Hillary but were voting for Jill. It would not have mattered (solid red state) but I tried to still get them to vote for Hillary."
dcorrrg,CherryCityPulp,"Yeah, what's even worse is the media didn't cover it as part of the 2016 campaign at all, and none of the three debate moderators deigned to ask the candidates about Climate Change. So awful. Right? Last I checked, we all need to breathe air, drink water, etc. We're so, so screwed."

dcp0ech,Praetorzic,When it comes to economic policy they practically are. Social and environmental policy they differ on.
dcp1kzq,bigbadhorn,The only difference is how fast they drop to their knees to suck the corporate cock.
dcp2m00,,"Both parties aren't the same, but that doesn't necessarily make the Democratic nominee acceptable. Clinton advertised herself as Obama 2.0. Obama was a message of hope and change and he governed without the hope and change. He expanded two wars into seven. He didn't close Gitmo. He implemented Obamacare aka a Heritage Foundation creation. He didn't get a public option or try to fight for single payer. He allowed Standing Rock to happen. He didn't do jack shit about Flint. He suspended habeas corpus. Drones were just fun toys to Obama.Don't just point at Republicans and tell me how terrible they are, have policies that make me want to vote for you. I will continue to not care about Democrats until they choose to actually represent the people."

dcotszh,aclashingcolour,When? When was that the case?
dcoussj,shadovvvvalker,"Let's be fair. This election was a DNC cakewalk. You have a controversial authoritarian celebrity who thinks climate change is a hoax and trickle down economics works. You have a man who thinks nukes are there for when we need to use them. And they couldn't commit to a candidate(any candidate not just Bernie) who stood for universal healthcare, governmental reform, money out of politics, or people first politics. This was not a hard race to win. She lost states she didn't expect to lose but didn't even visit them. She made major mistakes and had a very questionable tenure as secretary. Her husbands foundation couldn't keep its transactions above scrutiny of the public. This was a loss by the DNC because they misunderstood the public and expected people to vote Hillary despite her being the worst candidate they had for the issues at the time."
dcop9c4,DictatorDictum,"Trump is hardly a party pick. He is one amongst many, Sanders and Paul included, who ran under the major parties because they know it's impossible to get a third party election. The Republicans gave significant pushback all the way up until he secured the candidacy and even afterwards.If it had been any other major Republican running in 2016, it would have been yet another case of both parties being the same. The fact that Trump breaks the Republican mold is exactly what his supporters wanted, so this is not an example of what people are talking about when they say both parties are the same."
dcop8pj,IsJusticeOrJustUs,"You do understand that drilling and fracking increased dramatically under Obama's reign, yes?http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/28/news/economy/obama-oil-boom/index.htmlHe did more to damage the climate than any previous president."
dcopp0h,TheCoronersGambit,You do realize that natural gas is a lot cleaner than the coal which it's replacing?And that coal is at an all time low?And that Obama has made reasonable progress in a lot of other areas of climate/energy policy?And that you're completely wrong?Right?
dctql2t,IsJusticeOrJustUs,Right - the Gulf of Mexico - just a lil tiny hiccup.
dctrloq,TheCoronersGambit,Right. Obama caused the Deep water Horizon.
dcun4j9,IsJusticeOrJustUs,"He was awfully free with the drilling permits, failed to provide proper oversight, inadequate inspectors, reopened for drilling too fast.Yeah - he did."
dcopwfw,insayid,"You conveniently forgot to mention that Obama has drastically decreased our dependence on Coal. His focus has been on cutting CO2 emissions and he has done quite a good job through a focus on fracking and making natural gas extremely cheap. You can't just go cold turkey and quit all non-renewables. This was part of his ""bridge"" to renewable energy plan. Fracking is bad, yes. But if we are going to kick non-renewables anytime in the near future we need to make hard choices and, to him, the benefits of massively reducing our dependence on Coal outweighs the dangers of fracking."
dcorow9,CallingOutYourBS,"Stop this strawman shit. I didn't want trump. Its still the democrats fault they snatched defeat from the jaws of victory AGAIN, because they'd pushing their own corrupt bullshit.Both parties aren't the same. Both parties are at fault."
dcouzkf,Smobieus,"Trump will follow thru with his 130 billion over 10 years of scholarship programs for inner cities, make the streets safer, bring jobs into inner city and poof the democratic party is toast. As they double down on failed policies, ignore the middle class and break windows at Starbucks rioting over the inauguration.Do these idiots understand more democrats abandon the party every time these rioters/looters come out for DinduNuffins because he couldn't follow a police instruction. It will be fun watching the DNC self implode."
dcopa37,chusmeria,"Haha. While we are experiencing this because the dems wouldn't stop screaming ""it's her turn."" While you're at it, just close your ears and blame it on the poor and uneducated, amirite?There's a lot of blame to go around here, a good portion of which is obamas self described overseeing of the hollowing out of the democratic machine under DWS. Or maybe it was just the nonexcitement of a shitty white moderate like Tim Kaine for VP. Or maybe it was Hillary and her team repeating many times that there was too little room in the democratic platform for bernies most popular policies and ""we will not listen to you anyways."" The dismissal strategy certainly won the day, amirite? Always playing the fucking victims, but never realizing that the party of workers rights pays attention and can see through your self-victimization, so you need to check your persuasion tactics before you keep digging the party a hole it can't climb out of. Jesus fucking Christ, just last year we were thinking the Republican Party was well on its way to total disintegration. We shall see if the dems are competent enough to take that republican lite shit out of their platform by 2018, but the reimportation of drugs policy failure by booker and crew is a good indication that the corporate .01% interests still control policy and thus won't have trouble controlling congress. Lots of bullshit to unpack with your statement, so let's get this fucking bullshit ass divisive rhetoric out of the party and choose candidates who are actually electable."

That's what bureaucrats do, make reasons for people to need them when we don't. You ever heard of farm furrows? The EPA recently declared them Mini Mountain Ranges and now regulate them as mountain ranges. The media that's owned by 6 corporations are trying to keep their green ropes strapped around your mind by selling you irrational fear and half truths like Donald wants to deports all Mexicans and Muslims. It's actually deporting Criminals illegal aliens that have been deported and arrested multiple times for murder rape, etc. and that the Mexican govt is sending them back. Also it's banning and then extreme vetting from Countries under the influence of Radical Islam. But yeah evil racist"
dcomytj,ComesWithTheFall,"Man-made climate change is propaganda. The earth has been warming for 160 years. Look up Randall Carlson on the Joe Rogan podcast (JRE 501, they get into it around the 30m mark https://youtu.be/R31SXuFeX0A?t=28m48s). The global temps have oscillated for hundreds of thousands of years, as far back as we can measure. Carbon dioxide isn't the cause, and man-made carbon dioxide is actually trivial. It's all propaganda, probably designed to make every person naturally in debt by simply breathing. This doesn't mean the climate isn't changing. It has always changed and *will* continue to change, no matter what you or I do. Temperature graph from the Greenland ice core: https://chriscolose.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/easterbrook.jpgAs you can see, it's not even that warm by comparison. Life also flourishes in warmer temps. The sky is probably not falling (yet), and it's almost certainly not caused by man. The next ice age is what should worry you.Edit: The 97% of scientists myth that's being repeated here is fake news. Pure propaganda. http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303480304579578462813553136 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/05/30/the-myth-of-the-97-climate-change-consensus/Challenge: engage in discussion about the merits of climate change without citing a made up stat as an appeal-to-authority fallacy.The XKCD koolaid-drinker graph that's being posted here by some people is an intentionally deceptive graph, by the way. It's graphing the acceleration of change in temperature, not the absolute change in temperature, and it's compared to the average change within an arbitrary time period of 1961-1990, which I suppose is needed to get the dramatic results.So on the graph between 1961-1990 it's comparing the temperature changes in that period to the average temperature changes in the same period. Gee, no wonder it looks completely level then suddenly goes slightly haywire when it reaches 1990. Shit graph.

dcoxz97,ComesWithTheFall,Your links to the wiki page mainly cite how scientists agree that the climate is changing. No one is disputing that. It has always changed.

dcoqgel,melodyze,"How exciting. I'm always interested in people that believe that entire fields of science are propaganda.I would assume you're aware that [97% of climate scientists agree that human actions are the majority driving factor in global warming.](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/)So that raises an interesting question. Do you believe that 97% of scientists have actively engaged in a global conspiracy to perpetuate financial burdens on the working class? Have you ever set foot in a university or done research work to see how insane that would be? Are you aware that the most lucrative scientific careers are made by disproving consensus, and that there are enormous direct and indirect incentives to show that the prevailing theory is *wrong*. Are you aware that science works through working to actively debunk hypotheses, rather than supporting them, and that a 97% consensus is almost unheard of in scientific theories.And beyond that, you're saying that the motive for this conspiracy is to put people in debt. Do you think that having the consumer class be in debt is good for the upper class? Debt in the consumer class causes defaults, which lead to massive market volatility and recession, like in the last housing crisis, and reduced spending, which shrinks GDP and causes corporations to downsize. No economist would ever recommend putting unnecessary financial burden on the consumers. And beyond that, the actual financial burden of climate change regulation starts with burdening large corporations with additional overhead, which is bad for the upper class. Why would the upper class conspire to raise their overhead? At least Trump's ""conspiracy by the Chinese to make US manufacturing noncompetitive"" is just deluded rather than a complete non-sequitur. And the only alternative to them being in a conspiracy, I suppose, would be that you think that the entirety of the field of climate scientists consists of idiots, and that 10s of thousands of PhD researchers who dedicated their entire lives to the topic have just failed to match the output of your superior intellect coupled to 30 minutes of research on Joe Rogan's podcast."
dcoreu2,ComesWithTheFall,"The 97% myth is fake news. That shows me how little you've looked into this and you're simply regurgitating the propaganda you've been fed. Don't take that personally, I'm just trying to help you. http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303480304579578462813553136 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/05/30/the-myth-of-the-97-climate-change-consensus/"
dcow1rq,IsaakCole,I'll say the same. We're just trying to help you. An overwhelming number say [again and again](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveys_of_scientists%27_views_on_climate_change) that it's happening.
dcoy95r,melodyze,"I'm sorry, but that article is not science. It's an opinion piece, that doesn't cite any sources, about one metastudy on climate scientists. I've actually done research on climatology in an academic setting. Ironically, you're the one linking propaganda. I hope you'll at least read my post and form your own opinion outside of opinion pieces by people who clearly have an agenda and don't have expertise on the subject.There are other metastudies than just that one too. There are actually so many of those studies that I don't have time to link them all. I'd recommend that you comb through the citations on the [very extensive wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change) on the topic and form your own opinion, rather than basing your opinion on opinion pieces by WSJ and people on Joe Rogan's podcast. That's not science. It's not even that complicated of a topic. There's no mystery in academia behind the causes of global warming. It's just an amalgamation of very, very well understood, indisputable physics. I think some people think that climate science is a kind of magic box that puts out a binary answer of yes it's our fault or no it's not. That's not at all true. Do you accept that different gasses have different absorption spectra? That just means that gasses absorb different wavelengths of light (mostly infared from the sun) in different amounts. It's well established. If you take a bottle of atmospheric air and a bottle of CO2/methane/water vapor and put them infront of a heat lamp you will be able to measure that the bottle with the greenhouse gas gets warmer. It's a simple experiment that's been done thousands of times (although far, far more precisely). Try it for yourself. That physical effect obviously applies to any system with incident infared radiation, like our atmosphere. That effect is easily testable by using our mathematical models for rise in global mean temperature, and seeing if they can predict that climate of other planets given their atmospheric breakdown. And it works great! [Venus is an excellent case study](http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/NatSci102/lectures/venus.htm) and it's climate fits with our model for an atmosphere with a high concentration of gases with high solar absorptivity (greenhouse gases). This of course being in addition to consistency with historical data. I think people get confused at whether or not human CO2 output accounts for the majority of atmospheric CO2, and think that that has to be true for human actions to drive climate change. It doesn't. The climate is a delicate balance. Much of the ""natural"" causes of climate change are feedback systems. This means that their contribution to cooling is a positive function of global mean temperature. Many of these examples are easy to understand. [The most powerful greenhouse gas is actually not CO2, but water vapor](https://www.skepticalscience.com/water-vapor-greenhouse-gas.htm). And [the amount of water vapor that atmospheric air can hold is strongly proportional to temperature.](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Kinetic/relhum.html) So water vapor concentration in the atmosphere is correlated to rise in atmospheric temperature... And rise in atmospheric temperature is correlated to rise in atmospheric water vapor concentration... That's called a feedback loop.Another one is the high reflectivity of ice sheets compared to the lower reflectivities of water or land. That means that as ice sheets melt, less of the incident radiant heat is reflected away from earth and more is absorbed in the sea and land, which in turn increases warming which melts more ice, etc. These effects mean that even relatively small increases in carbon emissions can have amplified effects on climate. It also means that we can reach a point in which cutting 100% of carbon emissions wouldn't stop warming. And that's really bad. [Average predictions on rises in global mean temperature show an expected 2 degrees celcius rise in global mean temperature](https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-projections-of.html) and many think that is optimistically predicated on carbon cuts today. You probably don't think that sounds like much, but it is enough to put [Miami entirely under water](http://seeing.climatecentral.org/#12/25.7617/-80.1918?show=lockinAnimated&level=4&unit=feet&pois=hide), [sink most of Boston](http://seeing.climatecentral.org/#12/42.3601/-71.0589?show=lockinAnimated&level=4&unit=feet&pois=hide) and [displace a huge number of people in NYC](http://seeing.climatecentral.org/#14/40.7128/-74.0059?show=lockinAnimated&level=4&unit=feet&pois=hide)"

dcophh2,IsaakCole,"[Sigh.](https://xkcd.com/1732/)Who wants to spread this myth? Who would benefit by putting every person in debt? And how is it that they've made this concerted effort spanning decades, administrations, fields of academia and national borders?I struggle to even think of an answer.But think carefully about who benefits from denying climate change. Who has the money and resources to do this? What industry tried to silence [scientists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Cameron_Patterson#Campaign_against_lead_poisoning) who discovered the inherent dangers of their products?Do you truly think this is propaganda? Because unfortunately I think you've been fed some yourself."

dcos0us,IsaakCole,"Something a great man taught me long ago. Always ask who benefits.In this case, I have serious doubts about those insidious wind farm lobbies, pulling off dastardly feats like blocking the view on Donny's golf courses. Their competitors however..."
dcowqa6,MacDegger,"You realise that anyone who has actually studied this (not just googled around, but actually went to school for this and can calculate differential equations, error margins, correlation and causation) ... basically every scientist who is competent to speak on this says it is true, right? You do know this?Not only that, but you know their models are actually being seen to follow what is actually being measured? Which proves their calculations are correct, too.Now imagine you are an expert in a field. You have studied it for years, done calculations, research, seen your theories be proven. And someone like you comes along who points to a podcast, who's only experience is googling for a few days or maybe even of and on for years. Do you really think that person is qualified to speak in any way on the subject? Especially if they can't even do the bare minimum like solve partial differential equations?I have two questions for you:Do you agree that non experts should defer to experts in a field? That someone who has fired a gun on a range once or twice is qualified to discuss ballistics and the pro's and con's of guns with a weaponsmith?And secondly: what is your scientific background that makes you qualified to put forth an opinion? Are you a physicist? Studied biology, chemistry, math, geology, oceanography past college level?"
dcoyd7l,lizardalien,"How does that benefit the creators of propaganda? Ask yourself that. Why convince 99% of scientists to say this is a hoax?On the contrary, I can think of several incentives for people to spread propaganda about discrediting climate change."
dconq64,Osziris,"You're in the minority so you will be laughed at but the same governments that have us in this fraudulent system and lie to us regularly are behind the climate agenda.

dcoorsj,Osziris,I believe what I see and I believe what I know has been worked on for many years now. It doesn't take much research to prove these things do in fact exist.
dcopju9,tense_or,Then why do you not believe the climate scientists who disagree with you?

In reality, they are the easiest and most effective method to stop the government from manipulating your brainwaves with EM radiation.(Please God don't let anyone miss the sarcasm here)"
dcooi1l,shreddolls,"This is incredible. Please explain how you think ""chemtrails"" work? So I (pilot) can help you work through the misinformation you have been told."
dcoovmd,tense_or,"Dude, don't bother. People like him are lost causes. They have good intentions because they want to the world to make sense, but they want it to make sense so badly that they are incapable of accepting their own limited ability to understand.They believe that ""official"" things must all be lies, since of course officials have told many lies, yet they somehow are able to trust unverifiable nonsense."
dcopdfy,Osziris,From my understanding they are using a variety of salts or nano sized particulates like aluminum and this has the effect of a greenhouse trapping in the heat as well as preventing some of the suns rays from reaching the earth. Combined with focused rf energy they can dissipate storm clouds and change weather patterns. As a side note I would love to be enlightened on how being a pilot somehow gives you authority on this subject? And yes I understand the difference between contrails and chemtrails.
dcoq5cf,shreddolls,"This is overwhelming the amount of absurdity in what your saying. What difference contrails are what actually happens. Rapidly freezing exhaust vapour. Chemtrails are made up bullshit. The amount of planes required dispersing what you describe as causing global climate change would bankrupt any country involved. That alone regardless of how absurd the so called science is would be enough do deter anyone from trying to manipulate global weather. As a pilot military/civil/commercial for the past 15years I have an in depth knowledge of weather, aeronautical engineering, and the industry in general. To tell you this conspiracy is beyond dead. The amount of ppl that would need to be involved is beyond massive. Yet there is not one ounce of actual backed up proof out there..."
dcou46g,ComesWithTheFall,"I don't know if what u/Osziris is saying is accurate or not, but you didn't really address anything he said. You're only relying on ""I'm a pilot, lol"" which has nothing to do with the topic at hand. Your experience flying an aircraft doesn't give you any special knowledge here.I guess you sort of made one argument, which is that it's expensive to fly lots of aircraft. You're assuming it takes an enormous amount of aircraft flying at 40k feet. It may not require many planes over a large area and it may not require that altitude. Checkout the US secret spacecraft: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-37I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm just saying you should be open to what Osziris is saying unless you have actual reasons to discount it besides your programmed kneejerk reaction."
dcowpu9,shreddolls,I made a quick reply to his/Her post. I asked about chemtrails which is what most conspiracy theories think contrails are. He/she said they knew the difference between them. This implying it was different AC spreading the chemicals to cause a world wide climate change to benefit some faction. My argument to that although not directly contradicting the chemistry of adding salt and aluminum to the atmosphere was based on a financial one. It would be untold Trillions to fund such a project. I'm not sure your reference to an autonomous high altitude AC. The plane i currently fly goes over 40k the altitude isn't the problem. It would be the size or # of AC to disperse enough into the atmosphere to cause a significant change. Metals and salts wouldn't carry very far even if put into a jet stream thus would have to be dropped directly over weather systems to disrupt them. Again this brings me back to the infrastructure required to do all of this. Apologies if I didn't answer what you were looking for. On a mobile in an airport terminal.
dcooq6d,IsaakCole,And for what purpose exactly?
dcoqrp1,Osziris,"Weather manipulation/control, policies for control like the UN agendas for sustainability. Warfare with droughts or downpours. The list goes on for reasons on why nations would want to control weather."
dcorcbe,IsaakCole,"So what you're saying is they're crafting a super-villain plot to control the weather. For a plan that would take decades to achieve. So that they can profit off of war and droughts. Despite the fact that countries in the Eurozone alone are already dealing with the shitstorm that comes with war/climate refugees.Contingent upon manipulating scientific findings which have independently arisen over decades of time, differing branches of academia, political administrations, and national boundaries.Yeah, I'm going to go with the simpler and more likely explanation here. Scientists are trying to warn us of a legitimate threat. Private interests such as OPEC are more concerned with protecting their bottom line so they happily spend exorbitant amounts of money to lobby, [mislead the public,](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/) and even harass [persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clair_Cameron_Patterson) who would reveal the truth.They've done it before, they're doing it again. It's the same people as always. But thank you for buying into their propaganda."
dcornge,Osziris,"In case you missed it war is very profitable with a few trillion spent this past 15 years alone. This is a diabolical plan with the end game being utilitarian control over all business and governmental affairs under the umbrella of a United Nations world government. You're main arguments is it would be hard to do and be expensive. There's a great multitude of documentation spanning these past few decades with regards to geo-engineering, aerosol spraying, and radio frequency technologies all aimed at controlling weather. There's a huge return on investment when you are trying to take over the world."
dcorvek,IsaakCole,"Oh, I have no doubt war is profitable, and there are certainly interests out there that push for a perpetual state of war.You however, are taking scattered documentation across the decades to craft a narrative.

dcp0v9p,atomicxblue,I think the cleanest coal is the stuff that stays in the ground.
dcosmka,Numeric_Eric,"Its cleaner coal. Not clean coal. Is it a solution? No. But its a pragmatic stop gap that will definitely benefit the US economy if we adopt it more and american businesses license the technology to emerging economies. In the same way we store spent nuclear waste, CO2 would be captured from coal burning and stored underground. Or it can be recycled and used in production. By capturing and reusing potentially 80-90% of CO2 it could be put back into food and beverage, paper and metal manufacturing. While Im all for Nuclear energy, its pretty important we don't overlook we're dumping radiation waste into containers and hiding them in the ground for 1,000,000 years. Nuclear isn't really a permanent solution either. It has its cons for sure. But I think an important point to look at is the EPA itself has supported it as a short term solution and the technology equally works for natural gas stations too. As far as trumps plans for scope and length. I didnt bother looking at them cause I didnt vote for the guy. But until we get to the point we wished we were at where we're totally operating on clean renewables, its not a bad idea to look at it as something that should be done parallel to renewable energy innovations and adoptions. Back to the other point of emerging economies worldwide. It will benefit the planet and business together for the US to work on cleaner coal technology until other places are less reliant on coal and have the money, infrastructure and sound minds to adopt nuclear and renewable. Its definitely a beneficial short term addition to energy problems. The US still has *a lot* of coal and potentially recycling the waste from it to use in other industries isn't an entirely bad idea. For sure though. People should really take a few minutes to read up on it and not support / protest against it purely on ideological grounds. Thats what children do, and hopefully we're a country of adults."
dcov7ve,GaimeGuy,"Looked up an old message board post from 2013 of mine (unfortunately I didn't copy the research papers I sourced from):The population exposure from 1000-MWe power plants amounts to 490 person-rem per year for coal plants, but only 4.8 person-rem per year for nuclear power plants.In other words, you are exposed to more than 100x the radioactive biohazards from coal power than you are from nuclear power. That is how state-of-the-art nuclear power plants are, compared to coal.The waste from a coal plant is in the form of ash that gets dispersed into the atmosphere, while nuclear waste is shielded from the population in storage (water or a dry cask).Because you pack and store the waste from a nuclear plant instead of dispersing it, you can also recycle it and dilute it and make further use of it as new technological developments occur over the years and decades. The stored waste that filled up a fridge from a plant in 1960s can be recycled into the size of a teaspoon using modern technology.With fossil fuels, you have to deal with all kinds of externalities from greenhouse gas emissions, acid rain, the mining industry and associated health problems (black lung, back, neck issues, etc), that simply don't exist with nuclear power.It's just that we've been using fossil fuels for thousands of years, so we don't think anything of them."
dcow0n6,Incendivus,"Keep fighting the good fight! I really believe that nuclear power will become essential somewhere down the line.

What you posted in your message board post is almost close to verbatim from the Wikipedia page on Radioactive Waste which uses it in the bibliography of those numbers. The problem is that its 24 year old research before cleaner coal technology was barely being invested in. The very things in place now and being further developed are the things that make coal wildly less hazardous to people and the environment. As far as the waste. Stack scrubbers capture 99% of all Fly ash according to the EPA. The rest of the ash is used in landfills and now recently somewhere between 40-60% of it being recycled into concrete and asphalt. >With fossil fuels, you have to deal with all kinds of externalities from greenhouse gas emissions, acid rain, the mining industry and associated health problems (black lung, back, neck issues, etc), that simply don't exist with nuclear power.CO2 Sequestrion would eliminate 80-90% of GHG Emissions, Acid Rain is caused by Sulfur and NOx thats addressed with desulfurization and specialized burners which reduce NOx by 50-60% and even more as we develop more CC technology. People against this are just plain impractical. Not only does over 50% of the world run on coal, the US is in the 40% area. To properly power the US at given power consumptions the US would need more nuclear power plants than there are in the entire world today. At the costs of around 9 Billion for a new plant, you're looking at a cost over $3.5 trillion just for the creation and not even accounting for anything else. I'm for nuclear power. I think its clean and safe. I'm for wind, solar, hydro power. Until we get to the point of widespread national and global cost effective means of getting all of us on 100% clean renewable energy, im in favor of using coal too. People and Im not even meaning you, are ridiculous. They don't want coal because of the hazards. Technology is developed that *significantly* reduces the hazards and potentially eliminates upwards of 80-90% of the hazards and they don't want that either. A whole generation of people who have a pie in the sky perspective of they want clean energy, but no one has an economically feasible plan of how to get us there considering clean renewable energy only gets us at 17% of our energy output. That fact that people are so against making fossil fuels safer and healthier is absolute insanity. Im completely on their side with clean energy. But closing your eyes and saying ""NO I DONT WANT FOSSIL FUELS"" doesn't address our real problems in the meantime while we keep investing in clean energy until it becomes cheap enough to expand it and wind down our fossil fuel production. So yep guess I'm an asshole for being in favor of a realistic solution and not getting my opinions on energy problems from Greenhealthyliving.com"
dcp2grs,GaimeGuy,"The people in the public sphere pushing for coal though don't WANT to diversify our energy sources, though.When people say they want to ""Bring back coal"" or increase coal production, it is usually presented as an alternative to green energy, not as a supplemental part of a broad-spectrum energy policy.So, when I see public figures bring up coal in a positive light, it usually sets off red flags for me, unless they state otherwise.Especially since for all the efforts made into making coal cleaner (80-90%, as you put it), it still, generally, is dirtier than every other means of energy production. And that's for the most state of the art coal plants, not the ones that are a few decades or even a few years old.Sure, making coal cleaner is great, but the industry is already dying on its own because of cheaper, safer, healthier, more viable, and better paying alternatives. Let's improve what we already have but not prop up an industry that we're better off abandoning sooner or later, and I'd like to make it sooner."
dcp4gsc,JVonDron,"Just how many state of the art coal plants are there? I thought I read a post elsewhere that they aren't being built or upgraded just because the market is moving away from it. If so, how can Trump bring coal back when there's few plants burning it?"
dcowaw4,MoreDetonation,"And almost all nuclear power plants were built decades ago. They were so worried about the (obvious) danger of nuclear radiation that they shielded it beyond the level of coal.

dcoupop,AthloneRB,"> While Im all for Nuclear energy, its pretty important we don't overlook we're dumping radiation waste into containers and hiding them in the ground for 1,000,000 years. Nuclear isn't really a permanent solution either.Modern nuclear plants (3+ gen units like the AP1000) produce very limited amounts of waste relative to their predecessors, much of which can be reused (and all of which can be easily stored). The half life of that waste is nowhere near 1,000,000 years.To be clear, I'm not against clean coal, but I think Nuclear Energy is getting a very bad rap that it doesn't deserve."

Some people make money while everyone loses.Store CO2 like nuclear waste? We're not storing significant nuclear waste underground because we haven't figured out how yet. If you move the CO2 into other uses where it's ultimately released, then you've not affected climate change.

It's going to happen no matter how much you don't like it. No matter what harm you think it's going to cause. It's what we have until we we have something better. The cost of building and maintaining nuclear power plants that would replace coal production is in the trillions of dollars, we don't have that money to spend a 16 trillion dollar debt.

And he's already picking a fight with China, and threatening the One China policy. And he's threatening North Korea. And he's undermining NATO and wants to encourage the EU to break up. And he managed to further inflame the conflict between Pakistan and India. Oh, and he wants to kill the Iran nuclear deal, increasing the chances they'll get a nuke.Basically, he's already significantly increased the risk of nuclear war in at least 5 different parts of the world. And this is literally day 1 of his presidency."
dcorp2f,EMINEM_4Evah,Nuclear war will kill us soon.Climate Change aka our world and species rotting away will kill us in the far future.Either way we're fucked.
dcp4l4v,Glamdring804,There are two major events that could actually end civilization on Earth. Our current President supports both of them.

dcouxgi,ggtsu_00,Not a problem for Trump and the rest of the baby boomer generation.

dcoqsdu,stale2000,You are exaggerating. Read the science. The science says that sea levels will rise by 3 feet over the next century.
dcos6hn,zorinlynx,That's the average.We already have parts of Miami Beach flooding several times a year during king tides. Three more feet would cause the city to be uninhabitable.There are a lot of cities close to sea level; they've already had to mitigate the effects of slightly higher than average tides. Three more feet will be disastrous. This is coming. I live in Miami and I've already accepted I may have to leave it in my lifetime.... and I'm almost 40.
dcowup3,Yosarian2,"If we see 3 or 4 feet of sea level rise this century, then the next big storm will utterly devastate Manhattan. Sandy was bad enough, but if you start with a higher sea level, the storm does a lot more damage and the water gets pushed a lot farther inland."
dcosu67,TXCOVZ1005,"Ha, shows your lack of life experience, and nothing else. I feel bad for you."
dcoof6i,delfinko44,Really not Islamic terrorism. I find that to be much more harmful. Seeing as there is a new attack somewhere in the world just about everyday. But hey we went up .1 degrees this year on average. Both coasts will be submerged tomorrow grab your scuba gear.
dcoq82c,chrltrn,"Man, I don't think you realize the gravity of the situation. There is strong evidence that man-made climate change is a huge factor that lead to the strength of ISIS. Here's an article from 2014: http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2014/06/isis_water_scarcity_is_climate_change_destabilizing_iraq.html You think the refugee crisis of the past few years was bad? Shit's about to go crazy. Very few places in the world are as affluent and therefore able to cope with drought the way that California does. And when people are no longer able to grow crops or even find water where they live, guess where they're headed?"
dcoqfus,delfinko44,Talk to nestle about Cali water problem they don't even think water is a human right
dcorukx,chrltrn,"Yeah, and that is what he had so say about American citizens. Think about how little concern he would have for thirsty Africans, for example."
dcoqkmp,GoAheadAndH8Me,The potential for climate refugees is a great argument for a border wall and pillboxes along the coasts.
dcorj3a,chrltrn,"Sure. Would be nice if we could try and stop making those people's homes unlivable first though, right?""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" - Ben Franklin."
dcou0n3,GeorgeAmberson63,"Yeah, but then the shareholders might not make as much money. And we certainly can't have that."
dcp1j74,GoAheadAndH8Me,"It would be! I fear that no matter what we've reached a climate refugee tipping point, and that whatever we do now we need a defense system to fight off a full scale invasion of anyone who will be below the new sea level.But curbing emissions and trying to find a way to remove and store co2 is definitely necessary as well."
dcoojk3,deleted_away,"You're failing to realize the potential long term and life altering consequences that arise from climate change. ISIS isn't going to kill you, your children, or your grandchildren. Climate change will."
dcoos9o,QuinnD3P0,"^This. It isn't about tomorrow, it's about what we're going to be leaving the rest of humanity to deal with once we're all gone."
dcoptco,factbasedorGTFO,"Very little oil and gas reserves in the States, that's what. The drinking of that milkshake ramped up with the development of new extraction technologies in the past 10 years. The rise of fracking wasn't a Trump or Republican thing."
dcooon9,Kimbernator,"Re-position the issue - much of what funds terrorism in the middle east stems from oil. If we fund fusion and figure it out, oil is no longer a money maker and it cuts off a lot of the resources used by terrorists.But yes, climate change is far more threatening to us than Islamic terrorism. It's just that it isn't quite as tangible yet."
dcopsl4,Bonghead13,"I live in Canada, and last year I went to buy beer in a t-shirt and shorts on Christmas Eve. It's pretty fucking tangible."
dcormqq,Kimbernator,"It's misrepresenting the issue to take single instances of weird weather behavior as a citation for climate change, but those scenarios will certainly become more common the way things are going."
dcou3x4,GeorgeAmberson63,Upstate NY checking in. I went golfing on Christmas Eve last year. This year we already had five feet of snow. Neither of those things should happen.
dcoqwhn,stale2000,"Oil isn't used very much for electricity. It is used to power cars. We don't need fusion to solve energy. We just need solar panels to come down in price by 50 percent, as they are already expected to do so."
dcopvhu,delfinko44,"That won't happen to much money involved. Anyway I was saying that to try and raise awareness that Islamic terrorism isn't really about Islam considering the densest populous of Muslims actually reside in Southeast Asia. I'm trying to say that there are to many problems in this world to say one is the worst. And don't count on anything changing soon, not because Trump is now president but because the elite don't want change. Say what you will but I believe that the big banksters control how the world works not the world leaders."
dcorkof,Kimbernator,"Nuclear war and climate change are the two things that have the potential to create an apocalyptic future.One of these things is in progress, and we are not moving fast enough to stop it."
dcooluf,UNN_Rickenbacker,Just because you see the effects of Islamic terrorism now (which doesn't happen in america by the way) doesn't mean the other won't be much worse.You can also focus on both problems at the same time.
dcoqhlk,wildryanoceros,"Man, I agree that climate change is the primary issue, but saying that Islamic terrorism doesn't happen in America is just not correct. Especially when most attacks carried out in the US are carried out by either citizens or legal immigrants."
dcoy8n2,UNN_Rickenbacker,Can you link any cases?
dcpc0fd,wildryanoceros,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Orlando_nightclub_shootinghttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Marathon_bombinghttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attackAll radical Islamic attacks carried out by citizens and legal immigrants.

dcpjwf1,UNN_Rickenbacker,And what do you want to do against citizens and legal immigrants
dcpmpei,wildryanoceros,I don't know. I'm not a policy maker. I'm just showing that saying Islamic terrorism doesn't happen in the United States is not correct.
dcpne5p,UNN_Rickenbacker,It's not external Islamic terrorism.
dcpspib,wildryanoceros,"It's Islamic terrorism. Which you said doesn't exist in America. Also, 9/11. External Islamic terrorism."
dcq11fn,UNN_Rickenbacker,"I agree that I was wrong on Islamic Terrorism in the United States. I now know better. However, it is a much smaller issue in America than in most other countries. And 9/11 is 16 years in the past. Isn't it time to stop making policies to stop events like 9/11, when nothing has happened for such a long time?"
dcq2c6h,wildryanoceros,Yea look back to my first comment. I said I agree that climate change is the more important issue.
dcq7lzi,UNN_Rickenbacker,"Oh, I read that wrong. Nevertheless, I learned something from out conversation. Thanks!"
dcq8hpm,wildryanoceros,Of course! Pleasure talking to you
dcoqois,Milkman127,"haahaha serious?pretty sure cops kill more us citizens than isis. Isis is a zero threat to us. we just have to keep them contained which we are doing. Climate change is a bit more complicated and harder to shut down. Worse comes to worse we have cleaner air, less people with asthma other diseases/cleaner water. Things that literally affect everyone.ALSO the sooner we are on renewable energy the more we can GTFO of the middle east. Which is the reasoning terrorists groups use to attack us. Think of combating climate change a long term strategic neutering of terrorism"
dcos9dt,twotildoo,"Well since more people are killed by dogs every year in the US than actual ""Islamic terrorists"", yeah I'm not so terrorised.Plus I lived through the '70s and '80s and there was a LOT more crime and terrorism then. And yet we didn't go full 1984."

dcomw6m,bikebum,"Waters of the US is pretty dumb sometimes. I've seen man-made roadside ditches and tire tracks on dirt roads get classified as Waters of the US and therefore be protected. Hopefully the whole thing doesn't get thrown out though, it has a good purpose."
dcopenh,oozles,"I actually have some work experience regarding something similar. In my state any water that exists for 90+ days out of the year, that you can walk up and stick your hand in is considered a state surface water. Most qualify as high-quality state waters, though some exemptions exist. This includes irrigation ditches, meaning you need to consider to impact of your septic system to that ditch as if that ditch could be used for swimming and recreation.Infuriating at times. However it is because once its surface water, you're not going to get much treatment of the water. Once it stops being groundwater and starts being surface water, what you see is what you get. So no, nobody is going to be swimming in or drinking out of that irrigation ditch, but you can be damn sure that water will eventually end up in a place where that is likely."
dcos535,bikebum,"I think there is a term they throw around, ""hydraulic connectivity."" Basically any surface water that flows into something that is considered Waters of the US, is also Waters of the US. Sounds like that's what your state does. Makes sense.Sometimes it results in some funny things. In my roadside ditch example, we were doing a road widening, which in effect moved the ditches over about 5 feet. This was considered a permanent impact to Waters of the US and we had to pay for mitigation credits. I tried to make the case it was a temporary impact since we were replacing the ditches but the Army Corps wouldn't buy it. They said it's the same as relocating a stream, which I thought was weird because the ditches wouldn't even be there if the old road crew hadn't built them."

dcp6ii4,therealciviczc,They'll destroy that. They'll make it impossible for renewable to survive in the market. There is old money in coal.
dcpa8ap,hopefulgardener,"I don't think they will destroy renewables. They'll go where the money is, and within a very critical period of time, nobody knows how long, renewables will bypass the fossil fuels in terms of profit margin. I think the key question of our time is, can we reduce that critical period of time enough to stop the worse effects that we're going to experience from climate change?Hopefully, the right's obsession with the free market will give cleaner energies an advantage."
dcpgdkt,LoganLinthicum,"They won't be able to destroy renewables, they are already more cost effective than fossil fuels in many regions and the price performance improvements aren't slowing down. What I believe will happen is America will become a joke and outsider in regards to climate change/clean energy on the national stage, and China will lead the way. Hopefully the national embarassment of that will help push us in the correct direction."
dcph3fs,hopefulgardener,"I guess that's where I kind of lose attention on these matters. I'm not particularly interested in America being an economic powerhouse and stifling out any other up-and-coming countries. Honest question: how will China leading the way in green energy really negatively impact the average American? I guess the way I see it is America will come around to renewable energy sooner or later because, like we both said, it will inevitably become more cost effective. So either way, there will be job growth in America due to the new sector opening up. Unless china finds a way to export the energy that they create to America... Maybe a giant ship full of Tesla batteries lol. But in all seriousness, I guess my lack of economic understanding leads me to not fully grasp the implications of China ""leading the way"" on green energy.I just don't want our planet to become uninhabitable to human beings. That's really it."
dcphu6y,LoganLinthicum,"I honestly don't care a wit about the nationalism angle, the only downside I see with China leading the way is less economic opportunity for people here(when there is enough solar pie for the U.S. and China to eat) and pushing the timetable out on getting a handle on climate change."
dcpbs3k,Classtoise,"Honestly, the refusal to move towards renewable seems so fucking asinine.Imagine you're an Exxon-Mobile CEO. You put big money into renewable energy. Suddenly, it's in demand. It hits BIG. Now, your rivals are fucking SCRAMBLING to join the green game. They're like chickens with their heads cut off, trying so hard to get somewhere reasonable before they miss their big chance.And here I am sitting on my ass raking in money because I knew how to broaden my horizons,Like, I dunno, maybe I'm fucking stupid, but it seems like the best bet."
dcpggwz,LoganLinthicum,Big players don't play the game the same way small players do. Competition is a whole lot riskier than collusion. They are used to being indispensable and writing the rules.

One ad kept me busy for a month. $55/HR for me and 2 dudes from Home Depot who knew what the hell they were doing. I talked to clients and made sure the project was done right and they did most of the work. I took $25/hr and gave them the rest. That was when things were slow. Shit is ridiculous out here right now. TL;DR. Catch a bus out to Seattle and you can find $20-25 hr work inside of 2 days if your handy at all or just a hard worker.

Well, for everyone living on it, at least."

Many people fall into that trap.

dcvwg9d,lowbrowhijinks,"You don't understand their position at all if it takes this much effort to legitimize your glib comment. Republicans trust their leadership. It's that simple. But their leaders are dishonest, which is a problem with their leadership. By reducing everyone you disagree with to being ""plain fucking dumb"" you're just playing to partisan politics as a team sport and reinforcing an adversarial relationship between parties. The take away is that people who accept global warming are ""smart"" and I can promise you that a huge percentage of Democrats did not arrive at their understanding of the issue by reading peer-reviewed studies, or by even making the effort of Googling ""Is global warming real?""They came to their position because the issue is politicized, and they trust what their leadership has said about it.In this way, Democrats and Republicans are exactly the same- they have an opinion formed because they trust and believe their leaders. Just because the Democratic stance is the one that is supported by the scientific community doesn't make Democrats ""smarter"" for taking it if they haven't corroborated the facts.In any case, if a Republican saw your comment, the response wouldn't be ""I should investigate this issue and learn the truth of it,"" it would be ""Fuck you, I'm not dumb."""
dcvxne6,fuckyeahmoment,"Mindlessly following what others tell you is, regardless of your perception, a really bad and stupid idea. Doubly so if they're a politician. That goes for ALL politicians.

President Trump didn't get where he is by saying Hillary was ""dumb."" He got there by characterizing her as the biggest threat this country could face- the head of the snake. And what you're not getting here is that by being so insulting and dismissive, you ARE acting like an 11-year-old. You ARE a part of the problem. You ARE making things worse.

I care about how you acted, which was shitty. But you say you're a judgmental prick, so that's the end of the ""argument"" right there. Keep in mind- you didn't say what you said in the context of the topic, YOU posted in reply to my sentiments about treating people like people instead of dismissing them as less. You saw someone say a shitty thing, saw me reproach them for being shitty, then doubled down on being shitty and then argued that you *were* being shitty, but it was OK. I tried to illustrate to you how people react to you saying a shitty thing, and your takeaway is that I've invented an imaginary persona for you that I can argue with? Or was your takeaway that you can be as shitty as you want because ""It can't get worse?"" I doubt it matters but at no point did you ever seem to disagree with my central point: ""don't be a dick because it makes people hate you.""What you lack in critical thinking skills you more than make up for with ego. Plus I honestly think that you have no understanding whatsoever of how the things you say are being perceived- because this ""argument against you"" I invented was you know- based on the words you said in the course of this conversation.Instead of hiding behind the guise of being misunderstood, make the effort to articulate your thoughts. And don't be shitty when you do it, or you'll keep coming off as a bratty kid with a chip on your shoulder. You'll probably see this differently- that this leg of our ""argument"" is just me tilting at windmills again, but what I have written here is just documentation. It's a recap. You can choose to use this dialogue of ours as an opportunity for introspection, or even self-improvement. It doesn't matter to me.

dcpe35w,,"Marginalization towards the right did NOT get Trump the win. What got him the win was:1) There were no good options2) The DNC sabotaged the closest thing to a viable candidate they had in order to ensure the one and only opponent Trump might actually beat became the primary - resulting in millions of liberal voters staying home on election night.3) Hyper-partisanship among those who want a ""strong-arm"" president at any and all costs, even if that strong arm comes with some of the most self-serving policies in American history4) Liberal media outlets literally gave Trump 10x more coverage than they gave their own candidate. That's like shooting yourself in the head at the beginning of a fight and expecting your opponent to die from it.I definitely do agree that the approach from the dems needs to change though, that party is in desperate need of reform."

dcorqvf,chrisarg72,"You're mistaken, comparatively, Shale is much more democratic than coal as there are lower barriers to entry. Setting up a shale drill costs only $5 million to $10 million, most of which can be financed through loans. Considering that setting up a McDonalds franchise requires a $2 million investment on average, this is the equivalent of setting up two to five Mcdonalds stores. Sure, a poor person could not afford this. But someone in the high middle class, to low rich class can easily take out a loan and their home and start drilling for shale gas or oil. Meanwhile, coal mines cost about $100-300 million to establish. This is beyond the reach of anyone but a large multinational corporation and the select few insanely rich of the world.Edit: also not to bore you, it is easier to secure a loan against a shale pump than a coal mine. This is because the majority of costs with shale involve purchasing the physical drill and fracking equipment. These drills are easy to transport and have high resale value, so most banks will give you an ABL, or asset based loan, to buy one as they know they can easily seize the equipment if you go bankrupt and recover the majority of a loan. Coal on the other hand involves a lot of exploration and set up costs (digging up the mine, getting it ready to extract, etc) this cannot be transported or resold other than at that mine. Thus if you strike out, unlike shale, your assets are worthless. So banks are less willing to pay for the costs, which means higher out of pocket costs."

Even if they don't succeed within that time frame, chances are that fossil fuel will decrease in value due to lower demand. If this happens within the next 10-15 years (I believe it will begin to happen way sooner, and a sign of this is that the Arabic countries have invested in other sources of income than oil for some time now), what will become of Trumps promises?

Businesses respond to economic incentives. Why the heck would any business manufacture exports in the US, if they know those exports will be targeted with tariffs in foreign markets? The correct business decision is to avoid those tarriffs, so that those businesses can boost sales. And they can do by relocating all export manufacturing outside the US.Trump voters despise Free Trade. So guess what? There will be less trade. This is all based on Trump's proposed policies. If the policies change, the outcomes will too. But I see zero reason to build export oriented manufacturing in a country that is about to start a trade war. If you see it another way, please explain what business incentives are there to locate an export oriented business in the US. You see a stronger border? Businesses see a thicker border and less access to highly skilled talent they need. You see lower corporate taxes? That's great. But businesses also want highly skilled and healthy employees. They don't want a workforce that doesn't have health insurance (illness means lower productivity) or poor education (increases costly training time). Lower taxes are only great till the point where they don't start impacting your workforce.Deregulation. Great for some businesses. Worse for others. Look at our example here. Tesla. You think Elon Musk wants lower CAFE standards? If that happens, his American sales will go down. So he'll move more of his business abroad.You think they are not being patriotic. Nonsense. It's just business. Nothing personal. Americans want to stick to 20th century businesses? So be it. The 21st century economy will be built in China and Europe instead."

Although all of the above links can be verified via https://archive.org/web/
dcol6xk,Neat_On_The_Rocks,It would seem they are just doing a makeover on the website.
dcomakk,mattattaxx,"The Climate Change references were more than just one page, it was stripped from the site everywhere and replaced with a page on a new energy plan, which attacks OPEC (and nations aligned with it), promotes ""Clean Coal"" and talks about increased access to shale and natural gas:https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy"
dconcyi,Yorio,Coal will never be clean. I can't believe this.
dcoo4cy,chunkamonka,"A coworker (here in the good ol' rust belt) was telling me yesterday about how now with trump, coal is coming back and that we've made so many improvements on it that you can breathe the fumes directly for years and have no harm. Also, it's ""cleaner than the shit we have to breathe every day because of gasoline emmissions"". I casually mentioned natural gas being more the cause of coal's decline, and he talked about he doesn't trust it because it's so unstable... I don't know where the idea about natural gas came from, but the rest is all too obvious. Conservative talk radio has absolutely poisoned the minds of so many people. Specifically Rush fucking Limbaugh. Fuck him."
dcoqhp3,simshim,"Your coworker is a fucking idiot.>Conservative talk radio has absolutely poisoned the minds of so many people.No, they didn't. I can listen to conservative talk radio all day long and not believe the shit they say. They are poisoned by that shit because they **lack the ability to think for themselves**. Otherwise known as ""stupid""."

dcox9oo,MoreDetonation,"+1 Resistance to poison against Breitbart's attack! You take half damage, converted to psychic."
dcoqsm3,simshim,No one has to drink the poison. They choose to drink it. It's a choice they make. They choose to be as stupid as they are. No one is mindless drone unless they were born with a severe mental handicap. We all have the ability to think and reason and seek the truth. Don't blame the media. Blame the dumb shits that believe it.
dcotwtq,dmelt253,"Do you realize how much harder it must be to have an accurate world view when you lack education, reasoning or an advanced skill set? Its got to be down right depressing to know you can't even compete with people in developing nations, especially if you happen to be one of those ignorant people that believe black and brown people are supposed to be genetically inferior and that you are one of god's chosen ones.In a case like this drinking from the poison well works as a defense mechanism to save you from dealing with the fact that you probably won't amount to much unless its handed to you."
dcor3m1,mushr00m_man,"this is kinda like saying an alcoholic or drug addict chooses to be an addict.in a sense, they sorta do, but in another sense they really don't."

dcorc8n,simshim,"In every sense they do. Don't do that. It's not productive. If you're addicted to crack, it's because, at one point, you **choose** to do the drug. For whatever reason, diverse as it may be. It was still your choice, so you only have yourself to blame. Again, I can listen to conservative media all day long and I'm not going to all the sudden believe climate change is a hoax. I don't believe in Climate change because the democratic media tells me it's true. I believe in climate change because I read, I listen, I watch documentaries and do a bunch of other intelligent shit. And that tends to lead to intelligent, well founded conclusions. Listening to some asshat on the radio or on TV isn't in any way an intelligent decision. No matter which side of the isle you're on.And believe me, democrats are just as dumb as conservatives.

dcosjmp,frustratinbubble,"being true doesn't make it useful to say. telling a drug addict that it's 100% their fault for doing the drug in the first place is absolutely true, but it dismisses the issue and offers no avenues to correct it.

dcot4ki,simshim,"> being true doesn't make it useful to say.The truth is always useful. Otherwise it wouldn't be truth. I'm not being hateful, discriminating, or mean for no reason. Yet you seem offended. That's not my fault. That is yours for being overly sensitive about it. So the obvious solution is to be less sensitive. > but it dismisses the issue and offers no avenues to correct it.You can't correct something while at the same time ignoring reality. While it is completely their fault, them not acknowledging that will not lead them to a life that is free of drug use/addiction. They have to accept it's completely their fault before they see true results and true recovery.>If your goal is to talk shit about them and make them feel bad, then congratulations.I'm not doing that, that is you being overly sensitive to the subject matter while ignoring my context and word usage in favor of your feelings. >If you actually want to make the situation better you need to do a whole lot more than blame them for it.On the contrary, that is the first step to a productive end goal with almost anything.Want the planet to completely change course in how we produce and consume energy? Well the first step is for every single one of us to hold ourselves accountable to it's ill effects. We haven't done that on a global scale, so therefore there is no global change."

dcosrj2,abelisntright,"Well to be fair, right-wing media, notably radio, is much more available and accessible in this country. There are a lot of places in middle america where you don't really have many other options for your news source.Yes, I know in the era of the internet that's no much of an excuse, but the fact that this shit is so prevalent basically ingrains this way of thinking into the culture and political lexicon of huge swaths of this country. You'd basically have to actively question the views and opinions of a lot of the people in your region and social/familial circles in order to ""overcome"" this bias, which is something that, unfortunately, doesn't happen nearly enough as it should. Fox News, for example, is a basic channel. When Rupert Murdoch started it, he intentionally lost like half a billion dollars in the first few years by not making it a premium channel, so that it would be as available as possible. More liberal mainstream sources, MSNBC for example, are premium channels that you have to pay extra for. I see (and to an extent agree with) what you're saying, and definitely think people need to take much more responsibility for educating themselves, but you can't really blame them when basically everyone around them thinks really similarly. I don't know, that's just how I look at it."
dcoteb3,simshim,">and definitely think people need to take much more responsibility for educating themselves, but you can't really blame them when basically everyone around them thinks really similarly. I don't know, that's just how I look at it. Still their fault because that is them being afraid to stand up for what's factual and true in favor of not being looked down upon by your family/social circles. Ultimately still their fault."
dcp1cws,abelisntright,"I'm not disagreeing that to an extent it's definitely their fault, but the point I was trying to make there was not exactly ""fear of standing up for what's factual and true,"" but more that it doesn't even *occur* to them that the information they are surrounded by isn't true, simply due to its ubiquity. Due to the lack of exposure to other ways of thinking or information that challenges their worldview, the only conclusions they can draw about the world are drawn from shitty, biased, and sometimes completely fabricated sources. I guess I see this issue as more of one about resources, or opportunity.It's similar to the conservative argument that people in low socio-economic situations should just ""get a job,"" or ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps and work harder!"" This way of thinking doesn't really consider ""well, do these people actually have the *resources* to do that?"" Of course there are exceptions, but these people are undoubtedly starting off at a deficit. Do you know what I mean? Again, I see what you're saying, but I don't really see the utility in just writing off huge chunks of the people in this country. To just say that they are ""stupid"" or ""bad"" in some way misses some key bits of the larger picture. To stick with my prior analogy, it would be like drawing the racist/classist conclusion that those of a low socio-economic background disproportionately engage in criminal/gang activity because of something innate about them (""being black, for example), rather than as a result of the disadvantaged circumstances of their brith. What's more likely: All of these people are all just *really* fucking stupid, or they simply lack the opportunity/encouragement to develop critical thinking skills? Personally, I'd bet on the latter. Given how frustrating the political climate has been lately, it's really tempting to just be like ""Nah, fuck all those people"" but I just don't see how anything productive can come from this point of view, and, frankly, I think it actually misses the point entirely.Sorry, I didn't mean to ramble on about this so much, but I've been thinking a lot about this lately given the pretty terrifying world we've found ourselves in since Election Day. I just think that if we're ever going to have a chance to combat this rise of anti-intellectualism and ""fake news"" we need to properly identify how we got here in the first place."
dcp6uce,RiD_JuaN,Really refreshing to see someone else who thinks like this on /r/politics

dcspegt,simshim,"If you can prove someone wrong with logic, reason and back it up with factual information. What other choice do I have? I mean I could just go into denial, but that doesn't mean what I believe is correct. Sadly this is what a lot of people do."
dcovrru,Lolq123,You can refrain from drinking poison but poison is still poison.
dcovtw1,simshim,"Yes, and the one inherent problem with the first amendment is that it doesn't protect against non-factual^(poison) information. So the next best line of defense is intelligence and an ability to critically think. Which so many of us lack. So you have what we do. People believing complete and utter bullshit. And that, in a nutshell, is how Trump is president today."
dcow64o,Lolq123,Agreed.
dcow9xs,simshim,Good luck getting any Trump supporter to agree. That is where the real success lies.
dcovv9d,Russelsteapot42,"What's more likely, changing the media, or making stupid people not stupid?"
dcovy9i,simshim,"Neither because both are equally difficult.Corporations control the media, so if you want the media to change you have to either influence the corporations to incite change or turn off the TV and radio in mass which will force a change. The latter requires people to not be stupid and the former, I have no fucking idea.Making people not stupid requires them to acknowledge that they aren't intelligent and are uninformed/ill-informed. That is extremely difficult because of how our mind works and how it relates to trigger defense mechanisms ingrained within ourselves. So again, neither because both are equally difficult."
dcow9xp,Russelsteapot42,"We actually did the former for a really, really long time through things like the fairness doctrine, but in a fit of fucking madness we got rid of that shit in the late 80s. Whether it's possible in the current political climate to put the genie back in the bottle, I don't know."
dcowkrc,simshim,"That genie has turned into a 6'2 70 year old with some weird fucking hair and a cult like following. So I highly, highly **highly** doubt him or his administration and government will be ones to seek truth. And if they did, holy shit God or aliens or both better come and help us. Because the end result of that will not be good."
dcoy20q,living_lego,"The narrow-minded, absolute arguments that your present make you have as much empathy and understanding as the conservative extremists you bash, making you no different from them other than the color of your political party."
dcoy6ao,simshim,Care you explain your stance further?I should say that I hold the same belief to anyone of any political party. Being of a certain political affiliation doesn't automatically make you intelligent and not susceptible to bullshit.
dcp1vkm,living_lego,"Your unabashed declarations regarding how all people who believe ultra-conservative personalities such as Rush Limbaugh (whose views I do not support in any way, I'm an independent politically speaking), are idiots by default does not take into consideration how those people grew up, the level of education they have, or the environments they are continually surrounded by. These are all factors that affect how everyone develops their personal views. In other words, those people may simply not know better because they have not had the chance to be as exposed to other perspectives and other types of people. That being said, one's intelligence does not directly correspond with their political views, even if there is a strong correlation. Correlation does not directly equate to causation by any means in any given situation. I am not qualified to judge you as a person because I do not know you, but from what I have seen from you in this thread, I have been led to presume that even though your beliefs differ from an ultra-conservative mindset, your overall philosophy does not. Your implications that the ultra-conservatives who follow the words of Limbaugh and the like are inherently stupid is no different from how some ultra-conservatives state that all people who are dependent upon welfare are inherently lazy. Does that make sense?"

dcosu8s,simshim,"It is unfortunate. But attacking the media dilutes the end result, which is an intelligent populous that can spot bullshit on their own. Attack the source of the idiocy, which ironically is the person/people believing the crap from what they believe to be a credible source. Expecting all media to be factual is fighting an impossible and losing battle. Expecting and demanding people think for themselves and educate themselves is well within reason.The issue with that is that people, in mass, believe they are intelligent. Despite believing falsehoods and having bias, conflicting views.However, once you break down falsehoods and bias believe, we all pretty much believe and want the same thing for our country and ourselves."
dcox3ya,,"> Expecting and demanding people think for themselves and educate themselves is well within reason.Not if the institutions aren't there for that to be taking place, it's not reasonable to expect that at all. You're basically complaining right now that more people didn't listen to Rachel Maddow about who they should have voted for, because liberalism is obvious and conservatism is idiocy. Who exactly was the brilliant opposition that everybody missed?"
dcoxb1y,simshim,I don't think people should blindly listen to anyone. If someone voted for Hilary because Rachel said so. They are about as intelligent as someone who voted for Trump because Limbaugh told them to.
dcpybxe,portablemustard,"You don't understand what the environment is like in places like the southeast where literally everyone repeats the same things over and over and literally convince each other of these things that are mostly false. For every one of you that is able to see through the bullshit. There is 30 more in the red states that believe that Obama is a foreign born Muslim. Then they will compare their narrative to ANY news that disagrees and labels them as false, fake news. It could be as prestigious as the WSJ to conservative minds and they would consider it fake news if it clashes with their mindset. But it took years of slowly poisoning the well with fox news and rush limbaugh and then recently the ever expanding alt-right news branches of media to get people to be this gullible.But this is is the problem because as we have seen it take hold, it has swept in to the center and southwest parts of America. They don't know who the correct target of their hostility and anger is and when their news points to an easy target and on the surface sounds actually believable, they bite. And then you see things like Donald Trump elected president. It confirms to those alt-right media distributors that they are working and it's time to double-down."

dcp2lkv,joggle1,"No, and I'm pretty liberal. The Huffington Post doesn't matter because it has a tiny number of readers compared to the number of people who rely on conservative talk radio and/or Fox News or like-minded friends or relatives on Facebook or email for virtually all of their news."

dcovo6l,simshim,">Neither one of them is inherently damaging on it's own.Both are damaging on their own. Lacking the ability to critically think influences your every decision. It could cause you to run a red light, while not realizing it's red for a reason. In doing so you plow into a man on a motorcycle, killing him. That man just had his first child. Now his wife is a widow with a newborn. His widowed wife is stricken with grief and commits suicide. Now that child grows up without a mother and a father. That child grows up to be a murderer and ruins the lives of many in the process.See how that works? That scenario may never happen, but it very well could. And it all started because that person lacked an ability to critically think, and think about the end result of their stupid decision. Deliberate spreading of misinformation is just as damaging because it damages the credibility of all and importantly factual information. You see this with Trump supporters who will reject the truth in favor of their nonfactual opinion. I'm sorry, but you are completely wrong with that statement."

dcp1cba,verdatum,"No idea what he's talking about regarding natural gas. He's not completely wrong on the other stuff though. The byproduct of properly combusted coal, once scrubbed is fairly pure CO2 and water. CO2 is poison, but it's a poison your body is designed to handle. You could breathe it, but it would make you dizzy. When mixed with sufficient oxygen and nitrogen, it would be just like clean air.Unfortunately, CO2 is still bad because it's a greenhouse gas. But it's not bad for Trump supporters, because they don't believe in human driven climate change. So there's no push for sequestering the CO2, because doing so is really very expensive.Another problem is that there's pushback from the conservatives on enforcing clean coal standards. They try to keep coal plants in operation that still release sulfur compounds. The coal plants that are still nasty do things like claim they can't afford to upgrade, and in many cases, they are given a pass as a result."

IIRC from my freshman energy science class, they pump it into the dirt or something, which helps a decent chunk of the carbon to be fixed again more or less right away by soil microbes.It's definitely hyperbole, and very clearly an attempt to keep coal mining viable, but it is certainly more eco-friendly than conventional coal usage, largely due to how low that bar is set."

dcoqu3o,psychicprogrammer,still awful though.
dcopf3l,utmostgentleman,"Coal can have a variety of impurities that effect how cleanly it burns. With carbon capture and high quality coal, emissions can be significantly reduced. The problem is that ""clean coal"" comes at a significant cost while coal's largest benefit is that it is relatively cheap. I wouldn't be surprised if the emissions limits for coal plants were eased in the next year or two.The strangest thing is that coal isn't all that cost effective when compared with recent developments in solar and the number of people employed by the entire US coal industry is much lower than one would expect considering the political influence they appear to have."
dcoqyut,psychicprogrammer,the reason for that is because coal mining area has a large number of marginal voters due to the massively distortion effect of the electoral collage.

dcortdc,,You use carbon scrubbers.
dcoru5g,Lonestar15,"There is a project outside of Houston that is trying out clean coal. The idea is to use a carbon capture technique to keep emissions from coal power plant. From there they put the co2 in a pipeline and send it to an oil field where it is used for secondary recovery by pumping it down the well to make the hydrocarbons less viscous? So they can extract it easier. They also have a carbon capture machine(or whatever it is called) at the we'll to capture any Co2 that escapes. Not sure what they do with the co2 after they use it for secondary recovery though, still pretty interesting. I'm also not sure how effective the ""capturing method"" is. I don't have a source since I'm on my phone but if you google ""Houston carbon capture power plan"" I bet it will come upEdit: here's a source.

If you are really lucky, they may even consider other things, like fly ash, and other gases like nitrous oxides.So far there is not a lot of huge plants out there doing this, let alone prototype ones. Also, a key issue is the energy expended capturing the carbon.Additionally there is a looming issue on what will this sequestered carbon be like? Will we have a new waste product that no-one wants?

There's really no excuse, especially to not even put up a placeholder."
dcooc8q,BenevolentCheese,"> You don't need to replace everything at onceThey aren't. They are replacing things one at a time. In the meantime, they've taken the previous stuff down, because the current administration holds different views. This isn't that complicated."
dcoog9u,mattattaxx,"Except as I've said already, that's typically not how things work when you're dealing with a website.They've replaced ones they care to address with new pages, like the Energy page, and left others completely missing. There's not even a placeholder - it would be very simple to have a mass redirect for those pages to go to a coming soon type page."
dcoqj71,Namell,They are not dealing with website. They are dealing with change of president.They can't check and rewrite all the things previous president added in last 8 years. First thing to do is to take down everything that might now be wrong information.It is not website redesign. It is totally new company taking over the domain.
dcor4tz,mattattaxx,Not having a redirect or information page *is* web design. The Canadian government managed to prevent a laundry list of pages missing when Trudeau took over for Harper.
dcoorr3,The_Brutally_Honest,"> Foreign FlairYou don't understand our government efficiency here. ""Government Efficiency"" is an oxymoron in the United States.For more information, see: Department of Motor Vehicles"
dcooxne,mattattaxx,"Nearly every country has government inefficiencies - I'm from Ontario, for example, which has a long list of government complaints most recently topped by Kathleen Wynne carrying a strongly conservative action platform with a strongly big government ideal. We have the worst of both worlds."
dcopdjh,The_Brutally_Honest,"Yeah... but anyways... The site is just being moved around. Take a look at a comment I posted elsewhere:Hijacking your comment here! It appears that several pages on the site are down. Namely ones that were centerpieces to Trump's campaign.I think it's reasonable to assume that the site is simply under construction and getting a makeover for the new Trump Administration (it'd be kinda messed up to just rip everything out when Obama was still in office even if he only had hours left).Other down addresses:https://www.whitehouse.gov/lgbthttps://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/veteranshttps://www.whitehouse.gov/economy/buffett-rulehttps://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/seniors-and-social-securityhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/healthreformEdit: It appears that they are simply being moved to different locations...https://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/ has been moved to:https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energyAnd it looks like the rest of the ""missing"" pages are being moved too! Just look at the ""Issues"" drop down and most of them have already been restored."
dcooy96,tmac25,"I'm sorry, do you have some of that ""faith"" in who our government contracts out to manage our websites? I appear to be out."
dcoozce,AlkarinValkari,"To play devils advocate, maybe whoever runs the code for the site are under authority of the current acting president. So the team has not been working on any updates to the site for trump because hes not in command of their jobs. Now that he officially is, they may be now working on the changes he wants and taking down the stuff trump doesn't want right now until the new pages are up to replace them. Mind you I'm just spitballing and this could not be the case."

dcosj1t,falcon_jab,"Although in this case I imagine that ""downtime"" isn't really comparable when the existing administration is literally no more.I'm guessing they just torched the whole thing as soon as he became President, and will work on filling it in later. Probably. They were very likely not in a position to be preparing for updates before he got sworn in. Perhaps moving over to an entirely new website support team.I'm guessing they'll get their security guys to install Wordpress or something."
dcosmt6,mattattaxx,"Oh, I don't think it's entirely nefarious, or at least I don't jump to that conclusion, it's just amateur."
dcoz1j9,percussaresurgo,"That's what is normally done. Trump and his people are not normal. This is likely the result of ineptitude, not a conscious decision to get rid of everything about climate change and LGBT issues."
dcp11w7,norsethunders,"Well, we're probably talking about some sort of CMS here rather than someone directly making these changes in templates and pushing the new code to prod. So it's not that unreasonable to expect that someone's going through the admin UI updating/changing articles as they go."
dconcs1,befron,"I would bet it has to do with policy changes. Trump has to hire people to make the changes, which can't be done while he isn't president, but now that he is president he doesn't want page's that contain stuff from Obama's policies up. Doesn't mean he will significantly change anything, but it doesn't mean he won't."
dcood30,TheBeginningEnd,Which is why the above is wrong in this case. It's not a web development issue it's a PR one. It takes time to hire people and rewrite the content and they don't want the existing administrations page up in the mean time.
dcosnup,warriNot,Hello that's what transition phase is for ? Is it not? I thought he had his policies in place ? Isn't that what you get elected for in the first place. And you are right it's also a PR ISSUE. Which can be corrected by having the policies that they are going to have a webpage with a simple line saying CONTENT COMING SOON. Looks better than no policies at all IMO but I am no businessman
dcoulzq,TheBeginningEnd,"He can't actually hire many people until he's in office. Most of the transition phase is spent finding critical appointments, and working out what should be the priorities in the first 100 days rather than trying to figure out what the website should say."
dcourzr,warriNot,"Doesn't the website just say policy ? Also, as I said a simple place holder is enough but this is not a big deal minor hindsight"
dcovscv,TheBeginningEnd,The website does essentially just say policy but no raw policy. The copy in the website is policy rewritten by PR. It's a shaped message. The transition period is spent figuring out the people and the message that can later be shaped.
dcovzs4,warriNot,Fair enough man. I really hope the current page of An America First Energy Plan isnt his real plan.
dcosinb,geekwonk,Two and a half months feels adequate if you've got a plan like Christie did. Dude had the first 1-200 days mapped out.
dconbkz,darkknightwinter,"They're just engaging in ""repeal and replace.""Yeah, they could work offline while leaving the other stuff up, just like they could just replace Obamacare without repealing it. The reason they don't: They actually just want it removed."

dcop68e,treehuggerguy,You would expect that to be done by a *competent* administration. It's entirely possible that the Trump team just noticed the memo sent to them in November saying that they are responsible for providing content for the White House Web site.
dcosl9e,geekwonk,"Web site? But when I went there it was just porn. The white house doesn't have a real website, right? Just like a Twitter and a Facebook or something."

dconweo,jamkey,I heard a podcast on what it takes to get stuff updated in govt or to update any tech. It's horrifyingly slow and convoluted. So it could be that they do actually have to just take it all down for a while. Seems strange that they would do it literally on hour 1. But maybe thats the way it was done by Obama in 2008 too.
dcoojdo,deadspider187,This was a cut and replace migration to a newly designed site. The old site is under archived website.
dcopcbz,mxzf,"Should be. If you've got good web devs they'll make changes to test servers and then push them. I don't really have that much faith in whatever webdevs the government tends to hire though, most .gov sites are pretty bad."
dcor7w2,,"If you are competent, that is."
dcormbd,TheRabidDeer,You may also be overestimating the quality of the devs that the government hires. Or do you not remember how bad the healthcare.gov site was at release?
dcos7pq,warriNot,Devs =\= system admins. That falls on the system admins for not checking for load balancing. But yeah all countries Gov sites are shitty makes me tremble
dcosgzh,TheRabidDeer,"It wasn't just load balancing, nothing on the website worked and what little did work was buggy. It wasn't until they brought in an entirely different team of people that turned it around to what it is now. It took me months to get coverage because of all the issues they had and in the end they told me to just make a new account because my old one couldn't get verified."
dcosipk,warriNot,Haha well I stand corrected. Not American from our side of the news it sounded like load balancing.
dcosr0a,TheRabidDeer,Yeah the initial website was the worst experience I have ever had with a website. Load balancing was definitely a huge issue but it had a lot of others too.
dcorq87,mydoingthisright,"Actually:> However, it's inaccurate to say that these terms were specifically scrubbed from the site by Donald Trump. On 17 January 2017, WhiteHouse.gov issued an announcement explaining the digital transition that would take place on Inauguration Day. For instance, all of the messages posted by Barack Obama under the @POTUS handle on Twitter were transferred to a new @POTUS44 account, giving Donald Trump the opportunity to take over the previous presidential Twitter account @POTUS. In the same way, the content related to the Obama administration on WhiteHouse.gov was migrated to a new web site, ObamaWhiteHouse.Archives.gov:- From Snopes: http://www.snopes.com/white-house-web-site-trump-changes/"
dcorui5,headinthesky,Repeal and replace in action
dcot3mc,xRehab,"Or it could be as simple as a makeover and the current POTUS, along with his advisors, decided leaving up the old president's values/beliefs/vision is not what they want people seeing when they first land on the White House website. **If Sanders becomes president in 4 years, do you think his team will leave Trump's old pages up on the site or will they be pulled down immediately like what we just saw? Do you think they can reasonably have a new page in production before he is actually sworn in that could go live at a moment's notice?** Or is it more likely they have a general page and talking points setup, but have to run everything through all the hoops and check every box before it goes live since this is arguably the ""biggest"" government website the US has?Ignore what those old views were or what the suggested new views may be for right now; look at it as new management is taking over. In any normal position, new leadership typically does gut the old and bring in a revised version of things - even if your revised version is essentially the same as the old, it is better to have a fresh ""new"" version of it that is attached to you. Again, we don't know what it will be replaced with or if it will even be replaced on the site, but don't jump to conclusions assuming the worst. While a lot of the suggested outcomes that are being posted here are very probable, a lot of them are worrying about things that go way above and beyond what is reasonably going to happen.I'll end this with what I explained in a lecture yesterday; Trump ran his campaign as the antonym of Hillary's. His entire campaign was built on ideas and dreams which is what won people over, but he didn't have any plan for how to achieve those dreams. Without a thorough plan crafted well in advance, the reality of his decisions and actions will fall well short of his goals. He may call for a wall and in the end only receive some extra funding and more boots on the ground; he may have called for the repeal of the ACA but will only end up gutting a fraction of it and slapping a new GOP title onto it while touting how great their new plan is in comparison to the ACA. Sit back and wait for a bit while the whole thing is transitioned. Once they are settled in and actually start making moves, then we can start picking apart what they actually *did* and not just what they *said* or we *think* they will do."
dcot6m3,HavocT,You'd think that's how it would work.. but then you'd also think they would have prepared something to replace ACA before shutting it down.
dcotc2x,WhyLisaWhy,Color me shocked that Trump wouldn't have a competent web team that would have the site ready to go on day 1.
dcp50om,faxinator,"Actually, during the inauguration (I watched it all from my dialysis chair today), it was stated that Obama staffers were actively taken pages down from the White House web site."

dcoo261,TheBrownWelsh,"Nah, the ""makeover"" was already done and prepped for release the moment he took office, as is customary.

dcooa6k,whatthefizzle,This is what's happening. A lot of old pages are redirecting to obamawhitehouse.archives.gov. I don't know if they did this when Obama first took office but I expect more pages to be added that aligns more with what Trump believes.I do hope Trump's position on climate change changes now that he's President.
dcoop5q,orlanderlv,"That's not how ""makeovers"" work. Typically, there's a dev version of the site they work on and when ready they release the work (called ""versioning"" and uses keywords like ""trunk"" and ""branching"" just like in regular programming).Source: Webmaster for several high profile corporate sites."
dcop13t,v4-digg-refugee,"Yeah, maybe. But they could've done it in a much more subtle way. To strike the pages completely, immediately following the inauguration, is to deliberately make a statement. The White House wants this to be news, otherwise they could've done things much differently. The real issue here isn't what he'll wind up doing with these pages. The real issue is that he's deliberately making a statement to wipe clean every policy listed in those pages."

dcom0lh,gAlienLifeform,"I wouldn't say it's an overreaction, the fact that this stuff was gone from the primary website in the first hours sends a pretty large signal about the way they mean to run this country.

dcoov4i,Reddegeddon,"Yes, this is overreacting. The White House website is renovated every time the president changes. LGBT rights aren't a priority on Trump's list as much as they were on Obama's list, but to also be fair, things have changed a lot during Obama's tenure, gay marriage is legal now, for example. Trump has other concerns, he isn't required to maintain the same priority list of issues that the outgoing president had.As far as climate change goes, that's how he rolls. He's clearly more focused on the economic impact than the environmental one, but I don't personally think he'll gut it to the point where we're just as bad as China. One of the arguments made during the campaign was that net global emissions will be reduced if America builds more product because we will maintain stricter regulations than current manufacturing countries, even if we repeal some of the more expensive ones."

Even then, the shit he's doing, the brazen way he's ignoring and shitting on science, future generations, immigrants and people all over the world in this country and out, his chance from anyone that gives or gave him one is nada. Politics becomes hostile with racists, misogynists and frankly, assholes take over. I hope people are hostile about the things that matter."

dcomq1k,ChLoRo8523,I mean all you have to do is look at his VP
dcoo563,frontierparty,Conversion therapy works!
dcp52nm,Nisas,Imagine if you started building centers to turn straight kids gay. Imagine how quickly that would get outlawed.
dcooaox,SirSkidMark,Ayyyyy
dcotgxm,usoland-sama,I hear he's anti mutants too
dcoxdy5,MoreDetonation,What about super mutants? Is he *super* against those?
dcoxoso,usoland-sama,"As long as they're xmen, yes"
dcpf50d,,But is he anti inhumans?
dcoy46r,markatl84,"He may *be* evil but he's handsome in a ""Generic Central Casting/Hollywood President"" kinda way. So that's pro-gay, right?"
dcoov4r,,God bless Mike Pence. Finally setting the country straight.
dcoqpgg,Yugiah,Or sending them to electroshock therapy until they are!
dee41qn,swaggy_butthole,"That actually isn't true. He supports gay conversion therapy but the shocking was falsified.Disclaimer: I hate the guy too, it's just that the shock therapy thing is 100% false"
dcp4qw1,,you realize that's fake news right?
dcp2v17,Mugsnotdrugs,Are you serious?
dcp36g3,,Of course. The West has lost its way in celebrating and normalizing degeneracy - time for a dose of reality and godliness.
dcp3c5c,Mugsnotdrugs,Come on man. What's so bad about two women being married?
dcp3qx5,,Marriage is a sacred bond between a man and a woman that is centred around the physical act of procreation and building a family. Gay marriage is self-celebration and hollow.Regardless I didn't mention marriage just the general disgusting levels of degeneracy that has run rife for too long. God guide Mike Pence to help the President see clearly on this matter.
dcp3sxc,Mugsnotdrugs,I thought God loved all?
dcp46do,,"God is a metaphor for the spirit of a collective people, so it depends whose God you're talking about. Mine & Mike's doesn't approve of degeneracy."
dcp4o5k,Mugsnotdrugs,So what your saying is god isn't real you just think gay is gross?
dcp4uzo,,No? The collective spirit of a people (God) is very real. Gays can fuck as much as they like but we need to de-politicize their degeneracy.
dcp5fdn,Mugsnotdrugs,Then we need to take away all tax benefits for straight married folks. And half of that collective spirit believes in gay marriage
dcp5sxe,,Why would we take away their tax benefits? We want to encourage procreation not limit them because gays want to be degenerate lol. Please don't pretend to know my God. You do not.
dcp69lh,Mugsnotdrugs,Dude. We can't even feed millions of homeless in our own country. How many more humans do we need to starve?
dcpajsu,HollrHollrGetCholera,That's pretty heretical. I don't think any major monotheistic religion believes that.

dconr9m,,"This list is just incredibly stupid and biased, so much that it hurts. Here's one example from it: >At the Republican National Convention Trump stated in allusion to Orlando that he would protect LGBTQ citizens from ""a hateful foreign ideology."" Not only does this dishonestly characterize the motivation of the Orlando shooting but it specifically avoids condemning hateful domestic ideologies, ie that of his Republican colleagues.This is just so misleading it's insane, first of all Trump didn't mischaracterize the Orlando shooter at all. And condemning the hateful domestic ideologies of Republicans? Are you kidding me? Are they honestly comparing stuff republicans support to a man literally going and shooting people dead? Incredible. There's more examples from there too. Just like the misleading Christian statistics. They compare Islam to one specific sect of Christianity, however Christians in general support gay marriage more than Muslims. It's blatantly misleading to push a narrative, and just looking at the data they posted themselves proves it."
dcoq9x1,whochoosessquirtle,There is no such thing as no bias. Certainly not on the right. The entire concept is an illusion in your mind created when someone told you it was so and you immediately believed them. Also you're responding to a list and right out the fucking gate you hand wave it away. Really dishonest discussion
dcoqh19,,"/r/neutralpolitics is a pretty good subreddit. It's possible to discuss things more objectively and in a fact-based data-based way. Everyone is biased, but your arguments don't have to be. Your data doesn't have to be lied about. There's better ways to argue and discuss things, that list was an absolute pile of garbage."
dcoog8v,FasterThanTW,>Can you give me an example of anti-lgbt policy? we can start the list with choosing Pence as VP.
dcopxb0,Augustus_Caesar1,How does that make sense? Pence being Anti LGBT doesn't mean Donald is.
dcoqiaq,whochoosessquirtle,"And Donald is pro-LGBT how? By holding a flag and taking NO ACTION, with NO PLAN?"
dcor7z6,Augustus_Caesar1,"I didn't say he was. Also, what action and plan would you like him to take? What needs to be done? I'm not up to date on what they are fighting for at the moment."
dcosezf,zinc55,"You can still be fired for being gay in most states. Gay people need equal protection under the law. We don't want marriage rights ruled back. Trans people need a ton of legal reforms, none of which Trump will ever do. Trump is anti-lgbt, his entire cabinet dislikes gay people."
dcosoli,Augustus_Caesar1,"Marriage rights wont and sort of can't be ruled back. Thats settled. As for the rest, thats on congress, not Trump. Trump is not anti-lgbt.

dcotjc6,zinc55,"> Trump is not anti-lgbt. His cabinet may be but him and his cabinet aren't one person**he chose all of those people**. He could have chose other people, but didn't. He is either anti-lgbt or simply doesn't care what happens to them under his regime. either option is *bad*."

dcotrqy,Katket,">Well, their stance on LGBT rights is irrelevant to their jobNo, its not."

dcour5a,Katket,">Well, that has nothing to do with LGBT rights either if you actually read it. That effects straight people just the same.So you didn't actually read it. Here's a quote from it right here :>""It is perfectly constitutional for the government to offer benefits or subsidies to some married couples while withholding those benefits from others.""They can't undo gay marriage, so they want to limit it as much as they can."
dcouvek,Augustus_Caesar1,"And >Last September, Texas' justices declined to hear the caseSo, are you going to make a relevant point here or are you just going to bring up any and all lawsuits that anyone can file at any time? The lawsuit was self defeating. To suggest its constitutional to grant rights to some people and deny others is obviously unconstitutional. The case was ridiculous which is why they didn't even bother to hear it."
dcov7o5,Katket,">To suggest its constitutional to grant rights to some people and deny others is obviously unconstitutional.Really now. Because there are a lot of rights that I don't have, that other people get.

dcow26a,Katket,">What rights are those?I can be fired in my state, and most of them, for being trans. I can't serve in the armed forces, and would be dishonorably discharged from it if they found out I was trans. In order to be seen as okay for anything by the state, I have to be forcibly sterilized through SRS. Some states allow apartments to discriminate against us.

dcpetd3,zinc55,"If obama had a cabinet full of people saying ""whites don't need rights, they're amoral and bad"" the right would have burned down the white house"
dcpeuei,Augustus_Caesar1,If thats really how you felt about it I would suggest you gather enough people to do the same. You have my support.
dcoqqfs,SyrupLicker,"So appointing (multiple) anti-LGBT politicians into power isn't a reflection of his beliefs on LGBTs... What about voicing (or ""considering"") opposition to federal laws protecting LGBT rights, such as gay marriage and anti-discriminating? Is that also too unclear? As long as he doesn't preface all these decisions with ""because I hate gays!"" we should go ahead and assume it says nothing about his overall thoughts on that demographic? It sounds like you just want everyone to play dumb."
dcoqzql,Augustus_Caesar1,Why are you assuming he is against LGBT because other people that are not him have those beliefs? That literally makes no sense at all.
dcorati,DJLockjaw,"It does, because he picked those people. Arguing otherwise is disingenuous."
dcord96,Augustus_Caesar1,So? Do you know for certain he picked them because they were anti-LGBT? Are you seriously telling me that he has to be anti-LGBT if he had picked anyone to serve with him that was anti-LGBT? Regardless if it had anything at all to do with their position.You're the one being extremely disingenuous here.
dcosq6r,SyrupLicker,"You haven't explained why he, Trump himself, has discussed considering getting rid of federal laws on gay marriage and anti-discrimination. With his appointees as an addition to this fact, why *wouldn't* we assume he's anti-LGBT? The available information very strongly suggests it's the case."
dcostfp,Augustus_Caesar1,"You want me to explain to you why you shouldn't make an assumption about someone elses beliefs? Does that honestly need to be explained? You're speaking about things that are under the powers of congress, not the president. Gay marriage also isn't going anywhere, thats settled."
dcp1kth,SyrupLicker,"Not an assumption then, an educated guess based on his words and actions. His powers as president are irrelevant to the question - how are those expressed sentiments not anti LGBT?"
dcosw63,FasterThanTW,"He didn't have to pick them *because* they're anti-lgbt. He picked them *despite* them being anti-lgbt which shows he is, at best, unconcerned with that community."
dcosykv,Augustus_Caesar1,"Okay, but their jobs have nothing to do with lgbt rights or lgbt issues. Thats like refusing to hire an accountant to do your taxes because they are anti lgbt or something. What the fuck difference does it make?"
dcotksh,FasterThanTW,"These aren't accountants, they're leadership positions that influence policy."
dcotlj2,Augustus_Caesar1,"Yeah, policy that has nothing to do with lgbt rights. That was kind of the point with the accountant comment."
dcoty6b,Katket,">Thats like refusing to hire an accountant to do your taxes because they are anti lgbt or something. What the fuck difference does it make?Because if someone is against me having human rights, why would I support them financially when I could just as easily find some other accountant to fill the spot?"
dcotzkw,Augustus_Caesar1,"Sure, but thats a personal decision that has literally nothing to do with the job or their ability to do the job."
dcou0q5,Katket,"And cabinet members decide policies where it has a direct impact on the policies they implement. I get it, it doesn't affect you so you don't care. But it does affect us."
dcou3a4,Augustus_Caesar1,"You can't be serious right...? Do you know what their jobs are? It has nothing to do with LGBT rights. Also, I find it funny that you would jump to conclusions about my personal beliefs. Unsurprisingly you're wrong."
dcorz1p,DJLockjaw,"Well, denying human rights to someone is kind of a deal breaker to people with actual humanity. Again, Trump selected these people, so it's clearly not a dealbreaker for him. If you don't have a problem with people imprisoning gays, then you can fuck right off."
dcosbfe,Augustus_Caesar1,"Well, he hasn't imprisoned any gays and he can't so... what are we talking about here?"
dcot428,DJLockjaw,"Judge William Pryor, who Trump has put forward as a likely SC nominee:> “this Court has never recognized a fundamental right to engage in sexual activity outside of monogamous heterosexual marriage, let alone to engage in homosexual sodomy. Such a right would be antithetical to the ‘traditional relation of the family' that is ‘as old and as fundamental as our entire civilization.” Texas is hardly alone in concluding that homosexual sodomy may have severe physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual consequences, which do not necessarily attend heterosexual sodomy, and from which Texas's citizens need to be protected.There is no fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy just because it is done behind closed doors… Because homosexual sodomy has not historically been recognised in this country as a right; to the contrary, it has historically been recognised as a wrong. It is not a fundamental right.”If there is no right to consensual sexual activity, then it can be legislated against, and has been in the past, complete with imprisonment of gays. Maybe crack a history book and look at the history of gay rights in the US? To the broader point - Trump is anti-gay because he has acted in an anti-gay fashion. To put people in place whose agenda is to roll back gay rights is anti-gay. We have nothing to judge Trump on but his actions, which have all been decidedly anti-gay. Or maybe he held a flag one time or something. I don't know."
dcot9tj,Augustus_Caesar1,"Thanks for the history lesson(I already knew). Thank god that isn't how things are currently so it holds no relevance to the situation. Let me know when something actually happens to roll back lgbt rights! I don't actually ever expect that to happen. I mean, its not like the SC nominee can roll back gay marriage just because he wants to."
dcoq6u7,jonsnowme,Dude having Pence as your VP says A LOT. That's like saying I LOVE JEWS! and then having a Swastika as your campaign logo. Picking Pence is the opposite of showing support to the LGBT.
dcoqbww,Augustus_Caesar1,"I have friends and family who are not LGBT friendly. That doesn't mean I'm not LGBT friendly or that I don't care about those issues.So, while you might think someone elses beliefs have to be shared with everyone they associate with, thats simply not reality. Believe it or not there are more issues than just LGBT stuff. Your purity test makes no sense in the real world."
dcoqpfw,DoAlwaysDoTheNo,The views of your family and friends are different to choosing someone to be your right hand man and policy influencer. Try using a stronger argument next time
dcorrqb,___OccamsChainsaw___,"His VP, all his cabinet appointments, his shortlist for the SCOTUS, and his promise to sign the FADA. Easy."
dcouhs1,,"I don't see a problem with it actually. I lean strongly libertarian, I believe religious people and LGBT people should have the same rights."
dcousy0,___OccamsChainsaw___,"You don't see a problem with a hospital refusing to let someone see their spouse on the basis that they don't believe they're truly married? You don't see a problem with insurance companies withholding spousal benefits to married same-sex couples? You don't see a problem with the federal government being unable to fire employees who refuse to treat married couples as married couples when it's relevant? This is not a question of us having the ""same rights"" unless I'm allowed to not recognize marriages performed in churches, or to refuse service to Christians.Your beliefs here do great harm. There is no justification for it. If you truly believe the above things are acceptable, you yourself are no better than the most virulent homophobe, in effect if not in intent.

The examples you give do not even compare to that kind of ""great harm"". It's far FAR less than that. And regarding healthcare, I believe that we should have single payer free health care and that it should be illegal for the government to discriminate anyway. I find it very disappointing you actually take it as far as saying that I'm among the worst homophobes when I believe people should have the same freedom as everyone else. This type of thing is a perfect example why everyone is full of hatred and divided.

dcovjbk,___OccamsChainsaw___,"The fact that you're trying to make yourself look good in comparison to *murderers* is telling. Your beliefs would make it such that in a medical emergency a hospital could decide not to contact a gay person's spouse (if you don't support this, you don't support the FADA). If you don't see what's wrong with that... well, it says nothing good about you. No person who believes such a thing is acceptable can properly be called an ally."

It is *categorically* anti-LGBT. If you support it, you are too. End of story."
dcox1z1,,"I didn't realize I need to support every letter of a piece of legislation. I agree with it aside from the healthcare field related discrimination. That's it.

dcoxatl,___OccamsChainsaw___,"What's the difference, if you support it anyway? I don't know you. I'm not emotionally invested in you. I don't care what you truly believe or whether you have any animus toward LGBT folks or not. Motivations mean nothing to me, only their effects.

It's like saying, well LGBT individuals are deeply harmed by the fact John Smith doesn't donate $10,000 to a pro-LGBT charity every year.

No high-minded rhetoric or appeals to libertarian fantasia like ""liberty"".> but my point is that you don't actually know my motivationsRight, which is why I couldn't care less about your motivations and only about the expected effects your politics would have on the world. You could be Fred Phelps or Harvey Milk, but if the policies you support are the policies *you* support, my evaluation of you doesn't change one bit.

dcpa9io,,">But that's exactly what you want to do! Don't you understand?There's a limit to how bad things can get when you believe in libertarian principles. There's NO limit to how bad things can get when you're dealing with an authoritarian regime. The most extreme thing a libertarian can do is leave you alone. This can't possibly be compared to actual executions of millions of people carried out by the extreme left and right. >In what possible way would letting a landlord evict their transgender tenant or an insurance company refuse to provide spousal benefits to a married gay couple be good for them?

dcpd7si,,">Then why not go full anarchist?

dcpey7f,___OccamsChainsaw___,"> Just because there's a limit to how bad things can get doesn't mean I want things to get bad. Several comments back, I told you that I believe in single payer government run healthcare, not very libertarian at all.Then your appeal to this limit to power isn't compelling, since you obviously think it should be ignored in certain circumstances. I obviously think this is one of those circumstances, so this argument doesn't work on its own.> Surely you're not advocating against the first amendment? Or are you?In general yes (I'm Canadian and believe the CCRF to be *vastly* superior to the American Bill of Rights), but not here. No, by ""unknown, toothless and ineffectual"", I mean they can't lawfully make any discriminatory decisions in conducting their business, thereby making their moral failures impotent. > A bigot with a company is a wealthy and powerful bigot. With influence. A bigot without a company doesn't have any of that.That's a good point actually. However, I think this specific topic is too complicated, noisy, and culture-dependent for it to be very compelling. I don't think it *necessarily more likely* that there be a class of stealth-bigots using money they get from their companies (which are protected from social backlash because they cannot legally discriminate) to influence policy in a way delirious to LGBTs than it is that if they're unable to discriminate public tolerance for bigotry will decline and thereby so will support in government, or than that the educated elites are more likely to be socially progressive and thereby have a louder voice than the bigots, or that the public will respond to their politiking or views anyway, or some other equally likely narrative. Looking at what we *know*, the US has at once no federal protections for LGBT individuals and a great many wealthy and influential bigots and bigoted lobbiest groups, whereas here in Canada discrimination is prohibited outright but no such influence by homophobes is exerted (even the Conservative Party affirms same-sex marriage now, and a Canadian conservative is more likely believe it to be moral, not just that it should be legal but that it is *moral*, than the *average* American). This definitely doesn't *disprove* your point, but it does suggest that it shouldn't be taken too seriously unless you have other information to share."
dcpaybg,HollrHollrGetCholera,">Sure, the company falls apart due to a massive backlash and the owner basically gets what's coming to him. That's one example of a good thing surely no?And here's the problem with Libertarian ideology. What if the region does not support such a response? What if you are one of a few gay people in a very conservative town? What if the majority of your customers support your views? What if the people who would be outraged didn't use the service originally?The market is a powerful tool, but it isn't a cure all. It is capable of being manipulated and distorted, such as monopolies and cartels. As an aside, you need to stop justifying actions by comparing them to literal genocide and murder. You don't get slack for being a racist by saying you aren't a serial rapist, you don't get slack for being a robber by saying you aren't a murderer, and your argument is not improved by stating that at least you won't cause genocide."
dcpcxmv,,"I know it's not a guarantee. I admit it's just an example of something that could happen, and in many areas in say, the US that's what would probably happen. When I make comparisons to the problems that LGBT people face in other countries I'm not saying that justifies what I'm proposing. It's difficult for me to put it gently, I'm not sure how. But in the grand scheme of things these issues like a business denying service are extremely small compared to what other people face. I believe everyone has to sacrifice a certain level of comfort so that everyone can enjoy the same freedom. Does that mean that some people would have it harder? Yes, it does seem that way. That said here are some things to consider:1. Just to be clear, it's not like every single business will suddenly create some kind of discrimination policies, it's going to be very few. 2. If someone actually hates LGBT people enough that they're willing to deny them service, is the law going to actually stop them? How efficient will the government be at investigating something like that? What's stopping them from doing something else to vent their frustration? 3. Paradoxically I think there's a chance that people might be more likely to ""see the light"" and overcome their extreme homophobia if they aren't forced by the government to do what they don't want."
dcpdet5,HollrHollrGetCholera,"In the grand scheme of things we are floating on a dust speck in a meaningless void and can be obliterated by a cold rock. You can take nearly any problem in the world, and try to negate it through comparing it to a larger problem. It's a common rhetorical tactic. It also isn't logically consistent, as it requires simplifying problems and social systems to the point that your only conclusions are good sounding but inapplicable theory. The idea of a government creating protected classes to ensure that discrimination is reduced, and if not eliminated then able to be punished, is only seen as government overreach if you are one step away from anarcho-capitalism. It is in effect one of the primary purposes of government. 1: Of course not, but more would be able to now than before, which represents a negative movement. 2: No, but it provides recourse to those affected. Laws are 1/2 prevention, 1/2 restitution. 3: I disagree. The only way that has consistently shown to reduce bigotry and intolerance in personal beliefs that I know of is through continued contact with people. Anti-gay people can have a change in heart when their child comes out. Racists can change their world-view when they serve alongside black soldiers. A hardcore liberal might become more sympathetic to conservative views if they can talk with a friend who is conservative."
dcpdpzd,,"I appreciate your reasonable response, don't get me wrong I can see your point of view. On the last point I just want to clarify a bit though, I think you've got that a little off. I'm totally in agreement with you about the effect of exposure, and how yes that can reduce bigotry, totally fine. However, what I mean is that when the government at the point of a gun forces you to do something that can only breed contempt. A person could find out that their friend is gay, and perhaps somehow organically through that change their views, that's reasonable. The state forcing you to do stuff isn't going to have the same effect."
dcpdzur,HollrHollrGetCholera,"Of course no one likes to be forced to do anything, but equality witihin the law comes before equality within social perception, and the latter is often a result of the former. There were people who after women gained the right to vote still held in their hearts that this was wrong, and that an ideology they didn't agree with was being forced upon them. But women were then equal in terms of voting rights before the law, and in time this came to be accepted as normal. In civil rights cases, blacks did not argue for equality in the eyes of their neighbors, but equality before the law. We take a lot of what we consider to be socially acceptable from what our government allows. If the government allows slavery, then slavery must be acceptable, otherwise it would not be allowed. The same is true for discrimination. If the government allows one to discriminate against another based on the color of their skin, then it follows that such discrimination must be acceptable within the society represented by the government, because we know intuitively that the government is formed by society. This is why equality before the law is so important. Hearts and minds change slowly, but the self can warp it's opinions and beliefs to conform to the societal structures around it, and the next generation will grow up simply accepting that this is the way it has always been."
dcpen39,,">The same is true for discrimination. If the government allows one to discriminate against another based on the color of their skin, then it follows that such discrimination must be acceptable within the society represented by the government, because we know intuitively that the government is formed by society.I think that the way you're framing it is that I'm proposing discrimination to be legal and fine. When people think of discrimination they've got a made up picture from past experience and knowledge. I don't believe in discrimination, I believe in people being able to refuse service to any individual because they're a free human being. The fact that people can discriminate based on race for instance is a sort of ""necessary evil"". The process you have described though is actually very dangerous. You could do as much bad as you could do good when you use the government and laws to force certain beliefs into a society. The examples you gave are good, don't get me wrong. But guess what? Sometimes people like Trump and his administration get to have power. Surely you see what I'm getting at? With great power comes great responsibility."
dcpfdey,HollrHollrGetCholera,"Your belief in the right to refuse service to people will result in situations that go far beyond some kind of wedding cake. What happens when the only grocery store for miles in a small town decided to refuse to sell anything to a Muslim family? The only doctor nearby refusing to see Asian patients, of which there are only a few in the area?You are, in effect if not explicitly, proposing that discrimination be legal. And if something is legal, it must be acceptable, until such a time as it is determined it is not and made illegal. Trump is still limited by the Constitution, and all politicians in a democratic government are limited by needing votes to retain power. If the administration uses laws to enforce certain beliefs onto people, then the people will vote appropriately, or so the idea goes. The idea that allowing for discrimination based on race is a necessary evil is abhorrent. All people give up some amount of freedom to participate in society. That's the whole concept. The amount of freedom given up, and the types of freedoms that are given up, are decided upon by the people. In America, we have, through the sacrifice of many individuals, come around to the idea that all citizens are equal before the law.There is no perfect system of government. The people will be the ones to judge whether what trump does with his administration is right or wrong, and will act accordingly."
dcpfws2,,">What happens when the only grocery store for miles in a small town decided to refuse to sell anything to a Muslim family? The only doctor nearby refusing to see Asian patients, of which there are only a few in the area?I really find it hard to take this type of thing seriously. It's a very absurd hypothetical that I'm not convinced would ever happen. Will there be a Muslim living in a tiny town in the deep south with only one store and that store owner happened to be so much of a bigot etc. ehhh, It's a real stretch. I wouldn't want to see that happen, but we live in a very connected time. When something happens in a remote part of the country the entire world can know about it in a few moments. So, the backlash doesn't just have to come from that town, it can be from anywhere. >And if something is legal, it must be acceptableThere is a very large number of things that are legal, but are definitely not acceptable. There's a lot of crazy examples that can surely be made here.>Trump is still limited by the ConstitutionEspecially because of it's focus on freedom and individual rights. >The idea that allowing for discrimination based on race is a necessary evil is abhorrent.Well I happen to think that giving some people more freedom on the basis or race or religion, etc. than others is abhorrent."
dcpguu1,HollrHollrGetCholera,"As far as hypothetical go, it's hardly ridiculous. All you need is a refugee family being settled in a place that previously lacked that kind of group. How about a gay teen living in a small town? And again, the people who would be outraged by this sort of thing are not the [people who would have any affect on the town. No one likes bad press, but it would be forgotten about in a few weeks by the vast majority of people. Backlash requires actual consequence, which i do not believe the internet age adequately provides without legal backing. I'm saying how society generally sees acceptability. Obviously, since people seek to change laws constantly, that many view certain laws and norms unacceptable. But it is far easier to support a position if the government has it as legal. It is both the focus on individual rights as well as the division of powers within the federal, state and local levels that restrict trump's power. The President is not that powerful of a position, it just gives you the most name recognition and air time. You don't get more freedom than others based on race and religion. You have the exact same freedoms. Your race, any race, is a protected class. As is you religious beliefs, and you gender, and your ethnicity. Those protections extend to all citizens."

dcookj3,PM-Me-Your-BeesKnees,"I mean, Trump's entire political career is based on ""Obama sucks, he's not even a real President anyway."" I wouldn't be surprised if he removes the O's from the keyboards and makes it a firing offense to say the name Obama without following with, ""The bastard...""It's not really shocking that Donald Trump is petty."
dcoout9,FatalFirecrotch,"That actually isn't how it works if you even just read the article. At noon today Trump's team took over the website, it is now their website and not Obama's. It doesn't make sense to leave his stuff up there."
dcosvnm,crownpr1nce,"Because the White House website cannot be showing the website of someone who is not president, it just doesnt make sense.Many pages are switched to place holders and the website is a lot more bare bone than it was under Obama. There is a lot of work and the website is just not a priority, it makes sense."
dcorprm,sirin3,I work on my homepage like that.
dcot90b,FingerRoot,Maybe it's going to be named something different. Maybe it will be a part of another page. Maybe they didn't update it the way you think they should because they don't have any material and don't want their website looking outdated. Don't stir up more controversy. Think rationally and don't start freaking out about something before you know all the info

dcompe7,Barron_Cyber,"if its ran by compotent people, yes. unfortunately as weve seen with the cabinet picks thats not who trump chooses."

dconp2f,DJ_Velveteen,"Now I'm envisioning some 22yo Young Republican finance major who has a Wordpress and put ""cyber"" in his list of peripheral skills on his resume."
dcop9lr,Monkeymonkey27,Trump picks the guy who runs the website?
dcoq8tl,rareas,The entire executive branch is his. Yes.
dcop6pz,ScruffyTuscaloosa,"...No.It's not like they're replacing the website's furniture or something. They don't need to physically get rid of the old pages. You edit the new site offline and then you replace the old one.The fact that they got rid of those pages within hours of the inauguration, and they're all pages related to things Trump has specifically stated he has problems with...Frankly it's a little naive to think that isn't ideological."
dcot5sg,crownpr1nce,"Yes they had the new website ready to go with what they agreed to put on it: Trump's priority and campaign policies. So bringing back jobs mostly and energy plan.But its entirely possible they do not have a good grasp on what their policies will look like and until then, they clearly wont leave a page of Obama receiving members of the LGBT community in the oval office and dont have any important information to put there in the meantime. So the team didnt include that page in Trump's website.Plus I'd imagine in a change like this one they wouldnt replace page by page. They would remove the entire directory and replace it with their own. So its not like they went and deleted the LGBT page specifically, they just removed and probably archived all of Obama's site and put their own up in its place."
dcormy4,roboninja,"Right, because climate change and LGBT rights are ""Obama things""."
dcotb8m,crownpr1nce,"They are topics that Obama had policies about to share with the people and priorities of his. Clearly they never were and most likely never will be Trump's priority. This doesnt teach us anything on that front.All we know fro sure is that there is a transition and any page put in place by Obama will be removed, even if its a page saying how kicking puppies is bad. It has to do with ideology that a similar page for Trump isnt a priority, but not because ""He hates gays and deleted them"". More that its not a priority enough to him to have a page ready in the small core of the new website. Lets face it his website is not yet as extensive as Obama was after 8 years of presidency."

If you look at what the ""issues"" were that were listed from the Obama administration, they are completely different than the Trump administration (trump also has only like 6 issues listed). That is representative of the focus of the administration. Do you expect the trump administration to put LGBT rights and climate change as a FOCUS of their administration? Of course not. That's not saying this is signaling some crazy crack down on LGBT rights, it could just be that he has a different focus."

dcoxhb0,204_no_content,"Just to be clear, this happens every time a president changes. Trump's site is essentially a new website that's hosted on the same domain Obama used.https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/lgbt is still a thing.Regardless, Trump won't stand up for LGBT rights. He discusses ""clean coal"" more than he does human and civil rights."
dcp3hdn,Bumbalo,"No offence but what else can you say about LGBT rights, or basic human rights. We have them, were one of the most liberal countries in the world. No need to beat a dead horse. Main focus right now is economy/energy/education and trade."
dcp5ear,204_no_content,"The concern is that LGBT rights will be taken away. Trump's administration is comparatively rather anti-lgbt. Pence has a long history of anti-lgbt action and passed a law that made it illegal for gay couples to even try to get married. It's a pretty serious issue for them.I agree that we're more liberal than a lot of countries, but we're absolutely not in the top 10, which makes it hard to say we're one of the most liberal. The only list I can find that includes the US in the most liberal countries places us at #16.I do agree that we need a focus on the economy, energy, education, and trade, though. I wish I agreed with the Trump administration's approach for any of those, though."
dcp5jup,Bumbalo,"I really doubt same sex marriage being taken away is a priority. Doesn't seem logical or even important to focus on. I understand it's a concern but that would have to go through the Supreme Court, and no one is calling for that. Just because someone has a religious belief doesn't mean they can warp the law to their ideology. I think Pence understands that and wouldn't do anything to even out Trumps administration into question. It would be a very stupid move."
dcp6unt,204_no_content,"I don't disagree. It absolutely would be illogical. Keep in mind that state and local governments get away with passing laws banning same-sex marriage, though. The GOP has a well-documented history of infringing upon LGBT rights.Here's an example from [today](http://staging.hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_GAY_MARRIAGE_TEXAS?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2017-01-20-14-40-49).

Is it really so dire that the human population may be 100% wiped out within the next 100 years? Or are you considering other factors that Trump brings into play?
dcosdgz,MolsonC,"It's very easy to process when you see the steps.1. CO2 and methane goes in the air at an increasing rate2. Sunlight is trapped in the atmosphere instead of bouncing back out3. Earth heats up at a rate that would naturally take millions of years, as evident in recording temperature recordsAs a result1. Crops dry up, as droughts are widespread, and forest fires are uncontrollable2. Some places become literally too hot to live in, others too cold3. Natural food resources, especially the oceans, are dry as acidification and overfishing depletes marine life, affecting not only humans but other animal populations4. Ice caps melt, raising sea levels worldwide, destroying coastal cities Mass migrations begin, not unlike the Syrian migration. Wars for resources begin, especially food and water, and hospitable places to live.It's not that shit will hit the fan. It already did. Trump and his team are just turning up the RPMs."
dcp17ul,DoktorSoviet,"Yep. while it most likely won't wipe out humans (we've survived some really bleak shit before), it will send us back to pre-civilized levels.Our time may only be a myth to the people of the future.

Worst scenario (with current behavior) is +4C by 2100, which is also not really good. Going back on coal for power would probably push us over +4C by 2100.If you want to be on the survivors side, learn to grow your own food, without running water in permanent drought."

dcp0j45,,"No, there won't be extinction within 100 years."
dcp5n0r,Sanpaku,"No, there's too much inertia in the Earth system for the full impacts to be felt in 100 years, and there isn't enough carbon in remaining fossil fuels and reservoirs like rainforests, peat, permafrost and seabed clathrates for a Venus-like runaway. However, over the next couple centuries a repeat of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum 56 million years ago, when mean temperatures rose 5+° C (about twice that on land) is very plausible. Even in PETM like conditions, there would be places suitable for agriculture, but they could only support a small fraction of the present, much less projected, global population.The major primary impacts we'll see over this century are heat waves, more frequent droughts, more frequent destructive storms, and crop losses, as some of our stable crops are highly susceptible to heat stress, and many of the world's breadbaskets will dry out with latitudinal expansion of the subtropical desert belts. A rule of thumb that's emerged from several studies is every 1° C means an average loss of 10% in crop yields. This means more failed states, conflict, and refugee crises, which as the last election suggests will fuel fascist politics in the developed world.Over the next century, we'll have around 1-2 m of sea-level rise, and many low-lying areas will either erect defenses or be abandoned to the sea. There are no defenses against the 30 m (or so) expected this millenium as Antarctica and Greenland melt, or the 60 m possible over the next few millenia. There are also no defenses against the combination of high summer temperatures and humidity which will make some places lethal to humans outdoors (around the Persian Gulf later this century, but including much of the US midwest in the full 6°+ C scenario.There is a possible worst case scenario playing out over the next millenium, in which the oceans become thermally stratified, and the chemocline above anoxic bottom waters rises towards the surface (photic zone anoxia/euxinia), permitting the proliferation of green and purple sulfur reducing bacteria and burps of noxious hydrogen sulfide to the atmosphere, which doesn't just smell of rotten eggs and kill directly, but also destroys the ozone layer. This mechanism is believed responsible for many of the extinction events in the geological record."
dcp82uh,blackfogg,"When you ask most biologists (Or other qualified people for that matter) that question, you'll get a answer somewhat like this: ""No, humans are like a really good virus, you can hardly get rid of us all. But it could certainly wipe out civilization, if we are not prepared."""

dcoyag6,Jushak,"Eh, I guess you're forgetting how pro-fracking she was."
dcp4oj5,Sanpaku,"Look at carbon emissions under Obama. Renewables were responsible for some of the drop (as was less energy intensive industry), but the majority is due to replacement of coal with natural gas, only possible because of fracking.Every solar array, every windfarm is an intermittent electricity producer, and the only economic way for utilities to counter nighttime and windless days is with natural gas generation, which can ramp in minute(s) vs. the hour or so that it takes a coal boiler to heat up. So every MW of wind also entails a MW of gas turbine. Fracking produced natural gas, from this perspective, is enabling for rapid growth of renewable generation."

dcoo499,Hazard_Warning,Hmm does his name begin with a T and end with a Rump?
dcoole2,Drachte,but he won the election
dcop7wu,mspk7305,he won the process but lost the election
dcoppg8,Drachte,Do you know how the american election works?
dcopvn4,spacemanticore,He lost by nearly three million votes and only won because of a handful of bumblefucks in nowheresville.
dcp1lqk,Askol,"I hate trump, but that's a completely unfair argument. He ran a campaign based on winning under the current rules. If the election were decided on popular vote he would have ran a completely different campaign."
dcp3lpu,muddisoap,I didn't know the current rules included running a smear campaign on your opponent with illegally obtained documents by your blackmailing mother country.
dcp4b46,Askol,That's a completely different argument.
dcpk3e6,muddisoap,"No. A completely different argument is ""kayaks are more fun than canoes on rivers"". This is like a main branch off the tree trunk of the argument you were having."
dcopyt9,Drachte,"but the election isn't decided by number of total votes, it's whoever wins enough states to get enough electoral college votes. So he won the election."
dcortmg,Chimp-Spirit,Hitler didn't win by getting the votes either.
dcos2zb,Drachte,Not even close to relation. Trump won by the means that have always decided the president in this country.
dcot2qg,Smallus_Dickus,"I don't like Trump at all but I don't understand these idiots saying that Trump lost the election. He won it. Popular vote has never decided election in the US, I mean holy fuck are these people that daft?"
dcou82n,Left-handed,"I think most people understand the process. I think that most people dispute its fairness and effectiveness, ergo, maybe it needs to be revised or updated. I'm saying this as an objective bystander. I couldn't care less about one party's results over the other. I'm just saying that, at least to me, it seems that majority rules is par for the course in the majority of voting mechanisms."
dcovwjx,ninjacereal,Then they should protest to change the process of the next election rather than the outcome of the last.
dcowgyx,Left-handed,"A protestation of a decision must have a beginning, and quite often it's in response to something that's already happened with the hopes that it will spur change in the future. I think that's exactly what is happening. Just like the Civil Rights movement and other movements throughout history. Protests began in response to something that happened and the movement began to spur change for the future."
dcp34uk,Hhtura,So that's a 'no'?
dcoq4ic,mspk7305,"Yeah & I will explain it for you so that you can stop being smugly ignorant: 1. The people vote. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the vote. 2. The rules that 'balance' the electors adjust the weight of the vote and can end up awarding the process to someone else. In 2016, Donald Trump came out ahead in that process and despite having campaigned heavily against it has since kept his mouth shut because it picked him. This means, in short, that Clinton won the election while Trump won the process. There, now you are less ignorant. Feels good, doesn't it? I can't help you with the smugness though, you will have to grow a bit for that."
dcoq9cn,Drachte,"The states vote, not the people. The people vote within their own states and then send electors to vote for whoever the state chooses as their preference for POTUS. There is no national election. You're saying she won a race that is irrelevant. If they were just chasing the popular vote both candidates would have played it differently."
dcoqdw7,mspk7305,"I see you have doubled down on both the smug and the ignorance. Trump will likely need a new pick for Education Secretary soon. Toss your name in the hat, I am sure you will be a good fit."

Clinton may well have won a popular vote if the electoral college didn't exist but it's completely impossible to say. Ask any political scientist and they'll tell you the same thing"
dcourc3,,"Oh man you people are still on the popular vote issue, that's a salt mine."
dcp0iye,IKnowMyAlphaBravoCs,"They fucking **love** that 3 million vote lead, but what they refuse to admit is that Sanders' supporters came out in droves to give that lead because if they do then they lose the excuse that it was Sanders supporters that cost them even though the places that made the difference were not progressive strongholds. What they also don't consider is that there were 136 million votes cast for president, more than any other votes for president ever, and 83 million of those votes did not go to Clinton.I'd source all this if I weren't on my phone, but you should easily be able to confirm it. If I got anything wrong, please let me know."

How would you feel, as a German citizen post- WW1, if your country was in shambles with a horribly hyper inflated economy, and a dashing young fella with a cool mustache named Adolf Hitler came along and said he would fix everything? Unfortunately he *was* part of the Nazi party whom practiced fascism and antisemitism, and was also a fucking loon (Mein Kampf) with plans of world domination by the German Master Race.

dcpifz8,-SpaceCommunist-,"To their credit, the Germans didn't elect Hitler - he was appointed as Chancellor by President Hindenburg after Hitler lost the election for presidency. The Reichstag fire happened, leading to Hitler organizing and presenting the Reichstag Fire Decree which gave him heavy executive powers, and Hindenburg signed it into law. Hindenburg then died the next year from poor health, and Hitler, using his newfound powers, declared the office of president null.So don't lose your faith in humanity just yet - the majority of Germany didn't want Hitler to lead them."

Even on the ""left""-wing, references to the unique greatness of your country abound.In general, you basically have an almost cult-like national identity, with flags and legends of your own greatness and union everywhere. You allow the preaching of ""american exceptionalism"" - an idea of some vague form of superiority that white americans hold over all other people around the world.You tell your kids manufactured legends of how the US won WW2, invented democracy, the internet and spacecraft, and quite a lot of you are secretly proud that your country stood behind the biggest power demonstration of our time (nuking Nagasaki and Hiroshima).Your flag looks like a candywrapper. Basically, your whole national identity is a bit like Donald Trump. Pompous and full of little cognitive shortcuts and lies to make the national identity feel grandiose and big.And the kicker - these narcissistic ideas (which have been there covertly long before Trump came to office and started blaring them out) might end the current age of human prosperity as we know it.There, I think that should cover it."

dcojdmt,jcargile242,"From the [whitehouse.gov page on DT's ""energy plan""] (https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy): >Energy is an essential part of American life and a staple of the world economy. The Trump Administration is committed to energy policies that lower costs for hardworking Americans and maximize the use of American resources, freeing us from dependence on foreign oil. You know what else would do that? Continuing progress on *clean energy* and working to make oil obsolete. >For too long, we've been held back by burdensome regulations on our energy industry. President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years. Those ""burdensome regulations"" are there to protect public health and save lives. Eliminating these ""harmful policies"" will cause unimaginable harm to our people and planet. >Sound energy policy begins with the recognition that we have vast untapped domestic energy reserves right here in America. The Trump Administration will embrace the shale oil and gas revolution to bring jobs and prosperity to millions of Americans. We must take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own. We will use the revenues from energy production to rebuild our roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure. Less expensive energy will be a big boost to American agriculture, as well. Yes, let's get busy fracking all over the place. Nevermind all those earthquakes! >The Trump Administration is also committed to clean coal technology, and to reviving America's coal industry, which has been hurting for too long. COAL ISN'T COMING BACK THIS IS A LIE LIE LIE. >In addition to being good for our economy, boosting domestic energy production is in America's national security interest. President Trump is committed to achieving energy independence from the OPEC cartel and any nations hostile to our interests. At the same time, we will work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy. We can boost domestic energy production AND move away from oil at the same time. In a few years China will be leading the clean energy revolution, making massive profits selling their technology around the globe, while we're sitting here in the old USofA, finding new and better ways to suck dead dinosaur juice out of the ground while more and more people are dying from cancer. >Lastly, our need for energy must go hand-in-hand with responsible stewardship of the environment. Protecting clean air and clean water, conserving our natural habitats, and preserving our natural reserves and resources will remain a high priority. President Trump will refocus the EPA on its essential mission of protecting our air and water. BWAHAHAHAHA OMG WTF all of THAT above talking about scrapping regulations which aim to improve our air and water quality and then THIS? **REFOCUS THE EPA???** FFS, how? By putting in charge a bought-and-paid-for shill for the fossil fuel industry? A man who only recently grudgingly stated that he kinda thinks climate change might be a thing maybe but he's not even sure if humans really have much to do with it. A man who as Oklahoma AG, has sued the EPA repeatedly over, among other things, laws requiring lower mercury emissions from power plants. Seriously? >A brighter future depends on energy policies that stimulate our economy, ensure our security, and protect our health. Under the Trump Administration's energy policies, that future can become a reality. These policies will do none of the above. Our economy will stagnate and fall behind as the rest of the world gets over its addiction to oil. Our security will suffer as climate change accelerates - our own military has said as much. And our health, fuck me... Destroying regulations which are intended to reduce pollution and hold accountable those who spew toxic waste into the water and air will have no positive effects on the health of Americans."

He improved on Mitt Romney's margin by more than 30 points (!) in Ashtabula County, Ohio, for example, an industrial county along Lake Erie that hadn't voted Republican since 1984.>And this is also a reasonably diverse list of counties. While some of them are poor, a few others — such as Bullitt County, Kentucky, and Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana — have average incomes. There's also some racial diversity on the list: Starr County, Texas, is 96 percent Hispanic, for example, and Clinton underperformed Obama there (although she still won it by a large margin). Edgecombe County, North Carolina, is 57 percent black and saw a shift toward Trump.FWIW Hilary won the popular vote by 2.8 million."

I also read that renewable energy employed a vastly larger number of Americans than all other dirty energy industries.Sadly, renewable energy won't be supported by business which dictates how our current leaders run the country. The problem lies in the very concept of being renewable. Coal, gas, oil all of those are limited resources. Only so much is collected and only so much exists. You have much more power over controlling price when the supply is limited. In turn greater margins. Renewable energy lacks the ability to imply scarcity and thusly you cannot manipulate price as easily.This will change. Eventually energy will be so abundant that it won't be a sector of extreme profit. Sadly American business people want to milk every dollar of dirty energy they can before it's exhausted. I just hope we see this changed before clean energy becomes so abundant, or America will come late to the party with an even worse environment and economy."

dcoqm1g,jcargile242,"From [wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_coal): >Clean coal is a concept for processes or approaches that mitigate emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases, and radioactive materials, that arise from the use of coal, mainly for electrical power generation, using clean coal technology. Currently, the term clean coal is used in the coal industry primarily in reference to carbon capture and storage, which pumps and stores CO2 emissions underground. Plants using integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) involve coal gasification, which provides a basis for increased efficiency and lower cost in capturing CO2 emissions. Prior to the current focus on carbon capture and storage, the term clean coal had been used to refer to technologies for reducing emissions of NOx, sulfur, and heavy metals from coal."

Trump doesn't think CO2 is an important contributor to global warming so he wants to loosen those regulations. While protecting clean air, clean water, etc. is a much more concrete issue which thankfully it seems like he is behind. It seems to me that, even if you disagree about his opinion on climate change, he's logically consistent on this issue.Also coal never went anywhere, coal produces far more of America's, and even the world's energy, than renewable energy sources.

These areas are more polluted than any place in America. That is true. But per capita the US still releases more atmospheric pollution.It honestly doesn't even matter at this point.

dcouw7d,Botogiebu,"Again, the only thing you may have a factual case on is CO2. The rest is pure speculation and again - the air pollution in China will give you lung cancer, the air pollution in the US will not. There are far more damaging forms of air pollution which are killing millions of people right now. The air pollution in some parts of China is like smoking 60+ cigarettes every day, 360 days a year. When your lungs are black, your snot is black, and everything around you is covered in soot from air pollution every few days, you can take your CO2 per capita and shove it up your ass. When virtually everyone around you has a chronic smokers cough and only see the sky a couple times a year, human CO2 emissions is a pretty stupid way to measure ""pollution"". People who think the entire pollution argument is measured by man made CO2, are easily distracted tools who have never experienced real pollution in their lives. I'm not measuring pollution dicks, I'm saying as someone who has lived many years in both the US and China that your belief that the US is worse than China on environmental protection in regulation is orders of magnitude wrong. China invests a lot more money on developing industries and manufacturing, China needs more power and is running out of quality coal, which used to be cheaper than dirt. They are investing heavily into nuclear as well because much of the country still has frequent blackouts. Just a few years ago it was not uncommon where I lived to not have any power from 10AM to 10PM for months during the summer. China needs more energy and will get it wherever possible. Don't confuse that with the Chinese government being liberal environmentalists."
dcox2aq,hayberry,You're missing the point.>It honestly doesn't even matter at this point. China is moving forwards and we are moving backwards. THAT is what we should be talking about. Not measuring our pollution dicks.
dcoy4kb,Botogiebu,"The US is **not** moving backwards. The market forces that are causing China to invest in new energy technology also are driving private investment in the US. There is no holding back technology like solar and EV at this point, it will continue to grow exponentially regardless of Trumps position on CO2. Removing a page on the white house web-page has little to do with anything, and any conclusions are conspiracy and speculation at this point. Besides, Trump mentioned new energy technology in his inaugural address. Updating the white house page is something every administration does, nobody knows if renewable energy will have a new page or not or what changes will be made. It's been only hours since he was sworn in. Maybe take a breath and put things in perspective."
dcoyesf,hayberry,"Don't act like removing the page on the white house is an isolated incident. With the current state of things it's obvious we shouldn't expect any positive moves on climate change from the current administration. If you have evidence that the private sector is advancing at any significant rate that would be interesting to see. But regardless we're not doing anything to the tune of $300 billion, and that's why you're missing the point. Unless you think the US has nothing to improve on, it's a useless argument."
dcoz4fn,Botogiebu,"If the US had millions of people living with daily blackouts and was running out of quality coal, the US would be moving much faster on Solar, Nuclear and any other viable energy source it could produce. The US is not in a state of emergency on this issue like China is, so the drivers obviously won't be as urgent. China is in basically a state of emergency in terms of air particulates caused by burning poor quality coal, and virtually no effective environmental enforcement over industry. More people will die of cancer (breathing and smoking) in China in the coming decades than is even imaginable in the US, possibly hundreds of millions.The US still has plenty of good coal, cheap natural gas, oil, and a much better regulated industry and cleaner burning power stations. People aren't having daily blackouts, or dying off left and right and choking under a thick toxic cloud of pollution for lack of clean energy. So don't expect the US to move as fast as China, who also has far more industrial power than the US and manufactures for the rest of the world. However, if you don't think the US is moving faster than ever before, just look at figures for solar installations. The US is less than china, but renewable's and EV are still turning into a hockey stick."
dcoz592,hayberry,"None of this matters without numbers to back it up. Blackouts have nothing to do with how environmentally sustainable a country is being. And the whole point is that the US and China might not be on the same level *yet* but at least they're sinking billions of dollars into it, where we're going the other way. What is it that you're trying to argue? That the US is okay going the way it is and we should stop complaining and/or praising other countries?"
dcp064j,Botogiebu,"I'm saying much of your praise is misguided. China invests in all energy because it has energy shortages. I don't have numbers to give you, I don't think you will ever find accurate numbers. But I do have experience, I know that I had no power during daylight hours for an entire summer, and so did everyone else in my city. Businesses ran on diesel generators during the day and supermarkets couldn't keep refrigeration going or foods frozen during the summer months. Every night I had to fill up a bucket of water to use during the day because there was no running water during the day either. This would go on for months at a time. Sometimes up to 72 hours with no electricity or running water. You are comparing apples to oranges. China and the US are both moving forwards, but if you think China is spending more money on energy just because they have green thumbs you're wrong. The economic pressures can not be compared. Beijing recently had some of the worst days they've ever had. Central China had pm 2.5 levels over 900 in the last month. A lot of that is because power stations are not regulated even close to the standard of the US, effectively none in many places. Using brown coal, not pre-washing the coal or filtering the emissions at all are huge problems. Documentaries which show Chinese pollution have been banned and censored in China. Praising China for environmentalism when you have never lived in China and know nothing about Chinese life or politics is absurd. Saying Trump is going to make the US worse than China is stupid, and annoying. Just stop."
dcox7m6,Botogiebu,"I am the first person to punch someone in the mouth for suggesting coal is the future. I could not be more pro solar, I worked for an electric vehicle startup and a multi billion dollar company investing in renewable energy. But nothing gets under my skin more than people who only latch onto a mainstream narrative and become single issue pawns with zero perspective. Seeing an Al Gore docudrama means you're aware of a single potential CLIMATE issue, not an expert on pollution. So don't try to equivocate your bullshit when you have zero perspective. Saying most air pollution is CO2 is meaningless, CO2 is a greenhouse gas that is naturally abundant and necessary for all life on the planet, CO2 is part of the life cycle of all carbon based life-form on earth. ""Man made"" carbon pollution is nothing more than returning millions of years of stored carbon to the atmosphere by burning long dead dead plant matter. It's like saying electrolysis causes man made ""oxygen pollution"". While releasing millions of years of carbon stored in plant matter will return the earth to a less hospital per-historic temperature, CO2 is not a poison or cancer causing particulate - and classifying them together is asinine. Thumb me down and cry all you want if you saw some keywords you've been programmed to be triggered by. When you're done crying, try evaluating your bias and getting some perspective."
dcoyc3a,Cyorkshireman,"How is it meaningless to point out that we produce 17 metric tons of CO2 per capita while China produces only 7.2?You don't think there's something wrong there considering China has 5x our population? That's not useless information. CO2 is a major contributor to global warming and producing so much of it is dangerous to the environment.If you want to contribute data regarding other pollutants go right ahead. Nobody's stopping you. Otherwise you're adding nothing to the conversation other than criticizing minor points within my argument.>CO2 is not a poison or cancer causing particulate - and classifying them together is asinine.Never said CO2 is a poison or cancer causing particulate. However if CO2 reaches certain levels within our atmosphere it *does* become toxic to us. The main reason I classified CO2 with Methane and Chloroflourocarbons is because they're the main contributors to atmospheric warming. China is moving forward, we are moving backwards. Complaining about China's environmental problems when they're at least trying to confront them, while we're moving towards worsening ours with Trumps proposed plans to pursue ""clean coal"", fracking instead of moving towards renewable energy like the rest of the modern world. Like I said, we should be less concerned with what other countries are doing and focus on ourselves."
dcp0vkv,Botogiebu,"Again, you are boiling 'environmental problems' into 1 single relatively tiny issue that doesn't effect anybody's life in China at the moment, when hundreds of other environmental problems are a harsh day to day reality for hundreds of millions of people in China. You are also assuming that everything the Chinese government does that produces less co2 than burning fossil fuels is because the Chinese government cares more about co2 than the US. That's not the case. China is investing a massive amount of money into energy because China has energy shortages. China is not switching to renewable energy because they are afraid of sea levels and the central government in Beijing is full of environmentalists. They are building renewable energy because it is economically viable in China and necessary. for their growing energy demands. You're trying way too hard to assert that the US is a worse polluter or doesn't care about as much for the environment when your opinion could not be less informed or more comical. The US does and continues to do a far better job at protecting the environment regardless of co2 per capita. It also doesn't have 5% of the of issues China is dealing with which makes solar absolutely necessary. China will level mountains and flood millions of acres for economic development and power to fuel development. They are motivated by development, not green thumbs. And while the industry is moving in the right direction, the pollution is incomparably worse in China, and continues to get worse and will for some time."
dcp234g,Cyorkshireman,">You are also assuming that everything the Chinese government does that produces less co2 than burning fossil fuels is because the Chinese government cares more about co2 than the US.The intent doesn't matter at this point. I'm not under the false notion that China has some altruistic agenda. They're doing it for economic reasons, like you said. But it benefits not just themselves but the whole world. The fact of the matter is they are moving away from coal and towards renewable energy and we are not. I find it pretty concerning that China is making smarter moves with regards to the environment than we are. They're set to become the world leader in renewable energy.

dcp05sz,kperkins1982,If he was totally on board with gay marriage he wouldn't be submitting scotus picks off a Heritage foundation approved listif he nominates a justice (via stealing Obama's nomination) and that person goes on to vote against it then in effect he enabled itI also don't see him vetoing any anti lgbt bills that come along either
dcp0v1g,maliciodeltorro,"Are you aware that Trump's nomination would be replacing Scalia, the most conservative justice, who voted against gay marriage?And what anti-LGBT bills do you expect to come along?

dcovkhj,ttrain2016,"It's not because you are equating civil rights not being in America because of a website?

That is why they burn cow dung in many parts of africa so they can keep warm and cook... Basically most of the things obama and the left has pushed are purely wastes of money that will produce no actual effect on the climate, much like the paris climate agreement.[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L5AVBOh4SM) is somthing so you can have some actual perspective, not that I expect that from the echo chamber that is r/politics."

Also the climate agreements we have entered thus far have no actual effect and just cost us a shitload of money that could be used to go to research.There are other problems though, such as how our grid is not set up at all for intermittent power and battery tech is really no where close yet (and we have all kinds of research going into batteries from the private sector). All of the companies that the goverment has given money to for research for solar have failed also...Don't get me wrong, I would like us to move to non pollutants, but the way we have been going about the entire thing really does not work."
dcp6pg0,animosityiskey,Wait this program?http://reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN0IX0A120141113
dcph476,Plasticover,> All of the companies that the goverment has given money to for research for solar have failed also...What is your definition of failed? Serious question. Companies (especially companies surrounding new technologies) not making a profit in 1-10 years is not a reality based way to measure their success.
dcp2fmh,Plasticover,"What climate policies from the last administration were wastes of money from your point of view? Research and funding of new technologies is how you drive down prices in the long run, which is what ""the left"" was doing.As far as burning cow (and other animals) dung, it has been going on for thousands of years for cooking and heating; it is common in places where there is little disposable timber. That is really besides the point however. What is actually happening in many of the world's poorest countries is something called [""leapfrogging""](http://www.sciencealert.com/the-world-s-poorest-countries-aim-to-jump-straight-to-100-percent-green-energy).

dcomx4g,Accademiccanada,China is the most polluted country on planet earth. It's also one of the most industrious.I'm 100% positive that they aren't doing this out of any concern for the environment and the only reason they've been speaking down to trump from the moral high ground is to make themselves look better on the world stage (while secretly going for a land grab in the South China Sea)China is doing this primarily because their local environment can't handle any more air pollution.
dconpfo,climber342,So you're saying a country that is feeling the effects of an unhealthy environment is doing this to clean said environment but not because they care about the environment?
dcouz13,Chosen_Chaos,I imagine that not having air you could probably chew in their major cities is also a contributing factor.

They have what they call National Center of Climate Change Strategy Research headed by Li Junfeng who won Zayed future energy prize http://www.zayedfutureenergyprize.com/en/Meet-the-2017-Winners/China government maybe authoritarian, but they aren't dumbass career politicians or climate change deniers, most of them are engineers and scientists. Next time do a bit of fact check. Whether they are doing it for themselves or the planet does not change the fact that they ARE DOING SOMETHING."
dcowaq2,Accademiccanada,I'm talking about likely ulterior motivation.I only say probably in my post because it's just my thoughts on what the Chinese are doing.
dcowp2k,kshatriiya,"Just hold back for a moment. Even if China has say, the motivation to gain more geopolitical influence by leading the investment in renewable, isn't it something good for the planet overall? The point here is that, Paris deal took a monumental effort and it was a desperate rally to save the planet that we are living on. Regardless of their motivation China is contributing A LOT, that is an indisputable fact. It is not a conspiracy. The most astounding thing is, amidst this GLOBAL effort to make our planet cleaner, your clown of a president is going backward despite having the leadership and influence in the whole world. Unless of course, you are one of those people who don't believe in climate change. If that is the case, just forget we ever talked."
dcox90k,Accademiccanada,"No, dude you misunderstand me. I'm not sayin global warming is a farce. Even though I have some support for trump I think what he's doing to the ecological community is really sad. He has to because there's no way his plans for coal and oil would get done if he admitted it. It's the main thing besides his cabinet that I disagree with. And in not saying what China is doing is necessarily a problem either. Just that we should take it with a grain of salt when an oppressive oligarchy does something good."
dcoxhk9,kshatriiya,"Yeah I see your point, I normally don't care about American politics or what you guys are doing but this is one area I was really hoping every country could work together considering the urgency."
dcpdcz2,Accademiccanada,It's a shame that coal mining and oil appear to be two of the public works jobs he mentioned in his inauguration. We're going to need a planet a few years down the line more than we're going to need a few hundred jobs across the country. There are only so many states with coal and oil reserves

But that was fake news.Then that Matt Damon movie showed us the truth. It wasn't Mongolians they were keeping out. It was lizard people.China does the long con better than anyone."
dconr8k,SikhAndDestroy,"Everyone wants to own renewables, nobody wants to be forced into using them before their economics improve. China's position has been that countries that have benefited from industrialization for longer should take charge and leave them (presumably BRICS countries) to catch up before agreeing to growth-limiting measures. Meanwhile, energy security remains one of China's Achille's heels. They desperately want to have indigenous companies own the IP, manufacturing base, and O&M expertise so it can be controlled by state-owned enterprises or Chinese investors rather than having to go abroad for that capability. It's why you see this huge dissonance between heavily investing in renewables whilst simultaneously rejecting their feasibility. And in this case mixed with some classic Chinese Whataboutism."

I've traveled a lot, and the difference in attitudes towards Americans abroad during the Obama years was vastly different than out was in the W years."
dcow18n,53bvo,"If people see that you are a decent and friendly person they won't mind where you are from. If you walk around in an stars and stripes outfit yelling murica fuck yeah and keep quoting Trump, not so much."
dcon3bg,GAndroid,"""Your friend"" could still move to Canada..."
dcotvhq,Chi847,Canada is not far enough away at this point...
dcoyf2h,Snorjaers,Easy. Just talk approx. 95% less than you regularly would do and you're fine.
dcos4gc,Wodge,"In Switzerland? Loads, but the cheese is nice."
dcowoyt,gamrin,"As long as you are not a dick, none at all. Most European countries can perfectly understand English and just a few refuse to speak it (France and South Belgium for example)."
dcp0g51,Asyx,They don't refuse to speak English they just so rarely get to speak English that they literally panic when they have to...
dcp0d9l,Asyx,"Not nordic but in Germany, you'd probably socially isolated.But learning a language isn't that hard to be honest. Especially if you are staying in Europe and already speak a European language (Indo-European specifically. But that only excludes Hungarian, Finnish and Estonian as well as some minority languages in Europe)."
dcpnmt0,DASK,Typically none. Good faith effort to learn the local language will get you a very long way. Americans do well over here if they are serious about taking in the local culture.
dcokzxi,RollinsIsRaw,do you guys have Physician Assistants?
dcola6m,SunTzu-,"Norway has a constant shortage of healthcare professionals. Expensive country as all hell though, since it's an oil country, but the pay is comparable."
dcoown6,CornflakeJustice,Most of the European countries require knowledge of the local language to work in the health industry right?I'm studying nursing and wouldn't mind considering not being here.
dcopmf2,Jinxzy,"I suppose nursing would definitely have a preference for knowing the language but then again at least in the nordic countries we have a pretty high demand for people in the healthcare sector, and on top have some of the highest average proficiency in English of countries without English as their primary language, so I'd still imagine pretty good chances of getting a job."
dcoqkya,CornflakeJustice,I'll have to do some looking when I start looking at the job's market.I have a kid on the way a little later this year and while I think my partner is open to moving out that way we're still in heavy discussion about where we think we want to end up.Thanks!
dcorfe4,archaeolinuxgeek,"I spent a few months in Denmark in a fully English environment and still couldn't help but pick up a bit of Danish. The local response was without exception overwhelmingly positive. If you take the time to at least try to learn the local language and customs, you'll never lack for friends."
dcoqgms,SunTzu-,"You're probably right. Luckily, Swedish and Norwegian are both some of the easier languages for English speakers to learn."
dcoqlzp,CornflakeJustice,True!
dcp0hve,Asyx,There's no way you're going to not learn the local language if you don't try to avoid it.
dcorbch,SvenDia,"If you leave, Trump wins."
dcorhwx,CornflakeJustice,"It's honestly a lot more complicated than that. I have between 2 and 4 years that I'm going to be in the US regardless. At that point my kid will be between 2 and 4 years old and I'll have a few things more important, like guaranteeing the safety and security of my family, which do in fact take priority over feelings of patriotism or country loyalty.And I've been considering moving out of the country for a long time before Trump was anywhere near the presidency.And depending on how the next few years go, staying may not be worth it."
dcoopl8,RollinsIsRaw,"interesting, Several countries have not expanded to include advanced Practice profesionals. I know the UK was in the process of expanding/testing....same with Australia and NZ.I hadn't thought of Norway... Id say Im on a boat tomorrow, but I want to wait until Trump is out...you know the whole USSR thing right now j/k...kind of...not really"
dcooqff,Tootski5,"""Expensive country as all hell though, since it's an oil country""?"
dcoqnyp,SunTzu-,"Yeah, Norway's prices are quite inflated since the pay is so high over there, and it all stems from their access to oil which has been used to push money into the local economy. It's a popular country for people to work in while saving their income and then moving back to a cheaper country to live."
dcorodv,Tootski5,"Yeah that's nonsense. It's cost of living has always been high due to high pay, high taxes, the cost of imports, and tariffs. If oil production equated to a high cost of living then China, Iraq and Iran would have some of the highest costs of living in the world."
dconv35,scoobyduped,How's the work visa climate? Also would having a Norwegian last name help at all in that regard.
dcoqxnb,SunTzu-,"Nordic countries tend to be very welcoming if you have skills that are needed. We've got generally well educated populaces, but there's always sector specific needs. Same will apply to most of western Europe.Having a Norwegian last name certainly can't hurt :P"
dconvbj,EditorialComplex,"Man, you guys all speak pretty passable English, but I'm sure there has to be a market for copy editors making sure it's accurate, right..."
dcop54w,Dark1000,There is.
dcor9f3,EditorialComplex,"I do like Oregon, though.Ah well, call that Plan C."
dcortg7,Eryan36,How would one who knows nothing about the emigration process go about learning about said process? Asking for not a friend.
dcp1ar3,Dark1000,You generally need to get a visa via a job or get accepted to a university programme. It depends on the country.
dcxclua,mel_cache,"Search for a country's immigration page and look up visa information. It's relatively easy for some countries if you're young and educated, much more difficult if you're older and have medical issues. Or happen to be in a field like geology and geophysics, where unemployment has been massive since 2015."
dcoojmi,a4s,"How difficult is it for someone from the US to find, and presumably get approved for, a job over there (specifically the Nordic countries)?"
dcor42n,SunTzu-,"Comes down to what your education is. There's no real fear of any kind of discrimination (that'd be against the law, and just generally not how we do things), so it's all on how your skills align with what sectors of the economy are in need of workers."
dcow90r,53bvo,"In academia we have more foreign staff than local, at least it was that way at my university in the Netherlands. It is a niche sector though. If you are good you can usually apply online (international oriented companies have their whole job application process in English). It really depends on the sector you are looking in really."
dcp5o4n,Lord_Wrath,Bout to finish up my degree in Bio and do my post grad in Germany. English works there too ;)
dcopgls,swill128,"I legitimately want to work there. But I don't get how to apply for foreign jobs, do I just submit an online application like any other job?"
dcoqjky,SunTzu-,"There's a lot of multinational companies where you can apply from their website for jobs in specific countries. The more specific your skill set, the better your chances."
dcopwy6,Tomhap,"Some shit advice right there. If you move to a country where english isnt the standard language, learn whatever is if you plan to live there. Source: am dutch, everyone who was born after the babyboomer gen speaks english, but if youre an expat who doesnt speak dutch, youre not going to fit in all that well."
dcorrd8,SunTzu-,"Sure you'd want to learn the language over time, but it's not a pre-requisite for working in the country. At least not over here in Finland."
dcoq6q3,kkkkat,"I'm a bathing suit designer, what are my prospects...?"
dcor8ad,SunTzu-,"France and Italy are nice...well...all times of year actually. Might need to learn the language though, those people are terrible snobs."
dcovawr,kkkkat,Oh yes the French especially regarding their language.
dcoqalm,herefromyoutube,What? I thought it was kinda hard to get into the EU?
dcoro0t,SunTzu-,"Every country has specific needs for educated workers and most western European countries have low birth rates so there's a generally acceptance that we could always do with some more people, and can't just rely on inter-European immigration."
dcoqjab,danesays,"I am 1/4 Norwegian and have relatives in Norway, but it seems difficult to gain citizenship there...? All the countries with good healthcare (I have a pre-existing condition) are hard to get into."
dcormxh,SunTzu-,"You generally need to move in pursuit of a job, which can indeed be difficult if you have health concerns."
dcorelu,Dorkamundo,"IIRC, the Nordic countries are some of the most difficult to obtain worker visas for, and getting dual-citizenship is neigh impossible in a place like Norway. Even for a 6'2"" semi-introverted guy with blonde hair, blue eyes and who's name is Norwegian, works in healthcare and has family that still resides in Stavanger."
dcosbqi,IAmSoUncomfortable,What good would that do? The US is on the same planet as Europe. Change needs to happen here. Fleeing the country is cowardly.
dcoshxv,SunTzu-,This was (originally) more in regards to people who were concerned about finding work in research fields which might get de-funded under a Trump presidency.
dcoslcj,IAmSoUncomfortable,"Oh, that definitely makes more sense! Sorry for jumping to conclusions."
dcosm0b,Infinity2quared,Isn't it hard to get a job/permanent residence if coming from outside the EU? I thought there were laws preventing immigrants from working for a while.
dcoth6z,SunTzu-,"There needs to be a demand that's not being fulfilled, but these always exist in booming industries, which will differ from country to country."
dcoujkp,pandm101,"Where can I sign up. I do standup comedy, so I should be welcome, right?"
dcoyez1,SunTzu-,"Germany needs your help sir, especially once the U.K. leaves the EU."
dcoyjyq,pandm101,I am 100% serious when I say this get me a ticket over there to stay and I will come over there and stay and also learn German and also try to make German puns.
dcp261h,Tuub4,Good luck finding a job.
dcxci65,mel_cache,Visas for working are an issue.
dconx0c,Nyefan,"Except for, y'know, England, which makes it a royal pain in the ass for Americans to work there even though we practically throw green cards at them."
dcor5qc,SunTzu-,"England might have to change their tune very soon, given that they made it clear they are going forward with a full Brexit."
dcox1aa,Whippr,Don't you also have those refugees raping everybody and Russia next door? No thanks.
dcoir3q,,Pro-tip: India speaks English. Y'all are welcome here.
dcokeua,cyanocittaetprocyon,"Wait a minute. Do you guys in India really say ""y'all"" too, or is this just someone in Texas??"
dcokx63,,I've lived in the US for a while
dcoo6ly,orlanderlv,Not in the north you didn't. Mid-south more like it.
dcorqj4,meatduck12,"I'm in a northern area. I use the phrase ""y'all"" in online conversations, it just won't come out of my mouth."
dcotrnm,Projekt535,Born and raised in California. I say y'all all the time.
dcotwsn,Chrispy_Bites,"As a native Southerner, I would like to say that y'all is an extremely economizing word. Since the singular you doubles as a plural, it creates so much room for misunderstanding in speech, especially casual speech.Other iterations of pluralizing you add more syllables: you all, youse guys, etc. Y'all is a single-syllable, unambiguous way of addressing a group of people in the second-person."
dcowf6l,xensoldier,I'm a native Texan living in California. I say y'all with pride and hope to spread it around the Bay Area.
dcp3yj8,Fozanator,"As a non-Texan, I feel like the Y word is *your word*. You know? Like, Texans sound cool when you say it to each other or anyone, but I feel like if I tried to say ""ya'll"" I'll drop a hard 'a' or something and everyone will hate me."
dconlvm,littlebritches420,"You're welcome here too, buddy."
dcoo26v,perrythebari,"But not for long, apparently."
dcoq3og,Interlakenn,History might repeat itself :(

dcop1tz,ReDMeridiaN,Translates into visited India on a Taj Mahal trip once
dcotcbf,RudeTurnip,"Dallas? A lot of Indians live in Dallas, which would explain the y'all."
dcopgxr,LordFuckBalls,"I'm from the Indian subcontinent and ""y'all"" is pretty commonly used a a plural ""you"" where I'm from. My American friends find it hilarious that there's a random hint of Texan-ness on the other side of the world."
dconr67,your_mind_aches,"Here in Trinidad and Tobago, we say ""y'all"" a LOT."
dcooeul,toadofsteel,"I don't know about *in* India, but one time I had attended an Indian wedding that was some offshoot of Eastern Orthodox. It was mostly normal stuff from the Orthodox church with sanskrit thrown in... until the time came for the priest to bless the marriage, when it suddently went full holy roller. Like it literally took a sharp turn to Southern Baptist. That was confusing as all hell..."
dcooxq2,dkppkd,A Texan would have said y'all're
dcoob9y,Edewede,Probably a Texas tech support person pretending to be Indian.
dcornwv,,"Heh. I'd love it if a white dude in Texas goes to work at a call center, and adopts a rich googly-moogly Indian accent, just to make the customers comfortable."
dcopwg2,thecricketnerd,"Actually, yeah. A lot of Indian millennials that are fluent use it frequently, without the southern drawl obviously."
dcottdw,Corporal_Cavernosa,It's gotten into our city-speak through American TV shows.
dcousu0,BullyJack,Upstate new yorker here. We say y'all.
dcown45,evanz,Interesting that this thread came up. In the universe of *The Expanse* series of novels and television series when humanity colonized mars the Texans and Indians settled in the same region and found a sort of cultural harmony. The Indians picked up the drawl and colloquialisms of the Texans.
dcoyzz7,tnturner,India is also kind of shaped like Texas.
dcoonci,TechyDad,"Does it count as irony if your ""American"" tech support agent is from India and your ""Indian"" poster welcoming you to their country is from America?"
dcoqls0,broohaha,They kindly do the mindful.

dcolyc4,Quietus42,"Estoy aprendiendo Espanol. Uruguay es un ~~hermosa~~ hermoso pais! Editar: ~~Es Hermoso? Por que? Lo siento, pero yo no lo se porque soy estupido~~. Editar dos: Entiendo ahora."
dcoob7x,politicalshakespeare,Hermoso* ;)
dcowf9o,Quietus42,Por que es hermoso y no hermosa? Me Espanol es malo porque soy nuevo. Editar: ortografia y gramatica
dcox3rg,politicalshakespeare,It's hermoso because country is a masculine noun and therefore the adjective referring to it must be masculine aswell (hermosa is feminine). En este caso es soy y se escribe nuevo.Great that you're learning Spanish! Keep it up!
dcoxrgk,Quietus42,Entiendo y mucho gracias!
dcop35a,Balazi,"I am learning Spanish, Uruguay is a beautiful country"
dcomjvc,vesomortex,"Namaste, Y'all."
dcopqum,Brighteyes720,"Here's a fun fact. Very few people in India uses 'Namaste' to address someone actually. It's too formal. Most of the people use Hinglish or regional language+English so half the words are English and half or not. Most people just use the word 'Hello' or 'Hi' only. Hello is used much more often though.Also, Namaste is a Sanskrit derived word so everyone from the South who speak Dravidian languages never ever use Namaste."
dcor3gi,daKav91,Blame the yoga studios
dcort6m,TheGameOfClones,"Yeah, I'm Indian and it's been years since I greeted someone with a Namaste. It is mostly a hello, a hi or a hey!"
dcov5om,vesomortex,Well I'll be damned. Thanks :)

dcong1b,AlwaysSpinClockwise,"Can someone from the US actually be competitive in the job market there? Seems like culturally, Indians have an extremely high drive for academic excellence success that surpasses a good chunk of Americans."
dcor13h,,"It depends on the industry and the type of company you work for. Most of the talent in that academic excellence in India lies in engineering. Because of the bad education system, although we have people with engineering degrees, they aren't truly capable of achieving engineering success in the world wide space. This is why a majority of Indian engineers working in India are actually support engineers working under a different title because of their degree. This is why Indian engineers are competitive in the support space but not so much in the actual engineering space. Any Indian who rises above this keeps moving abroad to innovate leaving the support people behind. This is causing a massive brain drain in the country where the best and brightest move away seeking greener pastures. The western education systems are far more advanced and practically oriented. So if an American educated engineer comes to India, you can bet he will be better than almost every Indian engineer at the same experience level. You will have to fight the idiotic cultural office politics but this is rapidly changing and, if you don't mind living in a 3rd world country, you can achieve great success in India career wise. A software dev with say 5 years of experience is going to grow at least twice as fast in India."
dcorjls,AlwaysSpinClockwise,"Whoah, I had no idea. That's super interesting, thanks."
dcorv8d,TheGameOfClones,"Man I think if you have a good job, you won't even feel like you live in a third world country. India is developing at a crazy rate."

dcoknm4,beaverteeth92,I'd go in a heartbeat. If I had any organizational skills I'd organize it.
dcp29aq,Optewe,I would fly from Hawaii to join
dcpsr5p,Anintricatedioley,Unfortunately I can almost assure you your administrators won't. If your grants weren't on the chopping block already then I'm sure they will be.

dcopa4c,Smileyface3000,I would actually fly up for this.
dcopdu4,beaverteeth92,"I don't know who would lead it. Maybe Ernest Moniz? It would make sense to have it organized and led by a scientist who led one of Obama's departments and who would be terrified of how the government's approach towards science will change over the next four years.While I'm brainstorming, an obvious first step would be to email department chairs at D.C. universities to gauge interest."
dcora84,superflippy,"We don't have to wait for someone to lead it. We pick a date & tell all the other scientists. We just get started.So, how about the Saturday closest to Earth Day?"
dcorz91,beaverteeth92,That makes sense. Someone make a Facebook event with a detailed post. Again I suck at organization or I'd do it.
dcovayl,superflippy,Done: [Scientists March on Washington](https://www.facebook.com/ScientistsMarch/) on March 4th.I've gotten it started. Who wants to pick this up & run with it? Don't like the date? Don't like the content or images? PM me & I'll add you as a page admin so you can fix it.

dgm2bjl,whatllmyusernamebe,Awesome!
dgm3xfc,whatllmyusernamebe,Awesome!
dcos2p3,EMINEM_4Evah,So the GOP can attack them literally? I wouldn't rule anything with those fuckers.
dcos7ob,beaverteeth92,Imagine the optics of Trump attacking thousands of scientists.
dcosblb,gelinrefira,And gathered together some of the best and brightest people which a huge segment of the population in America hate? I can hear the rifles firing into the crowd already.
dcosfdc,beaverteeth92,"A huge segment of the population likes them though. If Trump orders people to start shooting scientists, then we're truly beyond saving as a country."
dcot1gd,gelinrefira,Ohh I don't think he will. I'm thinking about the extremist elements among his supporters will love to volunteer to put lead into unAmerican scientists and liberals.
dcotkee,beaverteeth92,"I'd be worried he'd turn a blind eye to his supporters. As long as the police do their jobs we'll probably be fine.That being said, tomorrow is going to be the lithmus test on how Trump will handle protesters. If he starts firehosing people with signs, we're fucked."
dcp0bgf,pretendtofly,There are tons of female scientists marching for our science tomorrow. (I am one)
dcp0djk,beaverteeth92,Good luck! I'd love to see a science-specific one though. Targeted message explicitly in favor of defending science from a hostile administration.
dcvpie7,damunzie,"Scientist here. I hate to rain on the parade, but marches are for large groups of people, and there aren't that many of us. If you have a march with few people, it just looks pathetic and reinforces the idea that we don't need to be taken seriously. Scientists need to engage in some other form of protest, although I'm not sure what that is. Need to call in a social scientist."
dcwo3yi,yousuckatpropaganda,"It's not just for scientists, it's a MARCH FOR SCIENCE, Shucks there were tons of men at the womens march, right?"
dcwqywo,damunzie,"The original discussion was about a march of scientists. A march for science makes more sense, but I'd say we still want to have an idea of the order of magnitude of the size to determine whether it's a good idea."
dcxbku4,PurflePurfie,"Nurse here. We're trained in critical thinking and how to do scientific research from day one. Many of us who go on to get Masters and Doctorate degrees in nursing are also considered scientists, depending upon the field of study and research. I, for one, would be willing to march! Even if I'm not a ""scientist""!"
dcx6bnd,stellabrew,"PhD candidate in social science here. I agree with the comments about making the movement broader. A march for science in general can engage undergraduates and graduates in STEM and social science, policy makers, MDs, PhDs of all kind, lab staff, health care workers, environmentalists, citizens, and the list goes on. The message should be all inclusive about anyone who cares or respects science. I will certainly be there and promote this to my network of scientists and students."

Most of the democrats already know what needs to happen, but no doubt they will appreciate the support."

dcok4dj,,"Get with your society(ies). I think these will become very important lobbying arms in the next few years. They will have to learn to exert as much pressure on Congress as the AMA and NRA, and they can, if they do it right.One thing to watch is the ol ""we need to be politically neutral"" and the vocal minority of right wing asses. No to the first, and your 5% representation will be considered accordingly to the second."
dcokyfb,retardcharizard,You're right. I should probably contact some national organizations. My institution is mostly medicine and agriculture. Research biologists are few and far between.
dcpt56r,Anintricatedioley,Its different because the NRA isn't funded by the government. The grant money mostly flows from the gov. Academic societies cant really become lobbying arms because if they did money would divert around them and then there would just be homeless people protesting instead of scientists. Tons of biologists already can't find industry jobs and research academics is their safehaven. Academics cannot or shouldn't get too political for other reasons as well but the moneys the cincher.
dcpuknu,,"I notice you ignored the AMA. Vast amounts of money for medicine and research comes from the government. Scientific societies for sure are not funded directly by the govt.> Academic societies cant really become lobbying armsThey already are, and they understand that cowering doesn't work.

Environmental science (along with other sciences) take an altogether different (easier )series of physics/math than several other majors.Look closely at my wording; I said they take ""comparatively easy science classes."" Do they still take some challenging classes? Absolutely. Most majors do have to take difficult classes. But it's still a significantly easier ride through college than anything in STEM along with several other more difficult science majors (Chem/BioChem, Computational System Biology, etc.) All I am saying is that at my college (UCLA), Environmental Science majors have an overall easier course load than many other field (as stated above). You say you partied while your friends went out and partied more is the opposite of my 2-3 friends currently in that major. They have way more free time than I do (and many of my friends in more challenging majors do). That being said, there are some quarters were they do take difficult courses and have less time than usual, but overall, their classes are nowhere near as difficult. Maybe it's different at your college, but from my experiences (and my friends in other California schools), Environmental Science students often choose that major because it is easier."

Environmental Science is probably one of the easier bachelor of science programs, but my point is the electives needed are hard for environmental biology majors. Many schools require you take organic chem with a bio degree and that is far from introductory chemistry."
dcx103r,InTheMorning_Nightss,Glad we can get on the same page and come to a solid outcome from our discussion!
dcounfp,goldandguns,Personally I think it's more important to study farming and genetics so we can figure out how to cope
dcontrc,Floating_Pickle,I study the environment and I definitely agree that most students and professors at my school have had some depressing talks and moments. I had a professor cry to us as she explained how much she appreciates that we have chosen to study and how sad she is over the new administration.
dcooq63,tggadcox,Lol I graduated last month. Fuck me
dcooxam,MynamemightbeMorgan,As a natural resource major with a concentration in policy and management.... yeah...

dcoprja,Thor_2099,I'm going to hit it hard even more in my classes this semester and next. Especially in my non-majors class next Fall. This shit is important.
dcouiln,zoicyte,"no. just becuase the current political party in power is hostile to reality, doesn't make it any less real, and the companies and people in power that have to deal with this issues regardless of how deep the Trump administration buries their heads in the sand will still need them."
dcp1u4d,chocolate_enterprise,Have an environmental science degree. It was insanely tough to get a job in this field before this....
dcp56jg,DrPotatoheadPHD,Don't forget economics since Trump doesn't seem to think that field of study is real either based on his trade ideas.
dcp5mn0,j_ly,> and people getting environmental science degrees are wondering if it's going to be useless.Insurance companies already factor climate change models developed by environmental science into their actuarial tables.Government shouldn't be the only answer for everything. The free market will have plenty of work for environmental scientists in the years to come.

dcokmyo,f_d,">They won't get as much money from the feds anymore but private corporate funding should be able to fill the gaps (at least it was when I was helping my Physics mentor draft requests for funding after Bush gutted science funding).Private money isn't going to hold a candle to what the US government and NASA were capable of providing. Trump is chopping off the head of US science research, and don't be fooled that it will stop at that level. They'll move on to other avenues of attack swiftly."

Things may get better eventually, but there is going to be a lot of blood shed in the great spasms of societal change, and one day historians will look back and see that man made global warming started by the industrial revolution was a central component of every drop of blood spilled and every life cut short for the better part of a century or longer."

dcopbpq,,"The price of oil is absolutely going to go up - [the master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin) demands it to save his sovereign wealth funds and remain in power. I'm not sure what will trigger the increase -- increased instability in the Middle East, probably."
dcopyab,,"I know gas priced rise and fall all the time, but I have noticed a steady raise in price in NYC ever since he got elected."
dcosh89,,"I was thinking more of an 1979-style shock rather than a little price blip. I'm not predicting gas lines because the production in North America is close enough to satisfy demand, but the price is going to go up.It's crucial that Russia's production and shipping capacity remain unaffected while some other major producer is crippled. Could be Venezuela, but they're working on that on their own, so somewhere in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, probably) is more likely. Maybe moving the Israeli embassy to Jerusalem will trigger another war and tankers won't want to move through an active war zone."
dcot1pa,,"I just remembered the slow and steady uptick in price during Bush II election, and how the media went crazy once it hit $3.00 a gallon. With the way trump talks about ""wiping radical Islam from the face of the earth"" , and other posturing about the area, I was wondering if that would have an effect price in the coming months. But I guess will see when he actually tries to eradicate radical Islam."
dcou8tz,DeathByBamboo,"Presidential policy really doesn't have a substantial effect on the price of gas. There's only a couple things a President can do directly (get Congress to adjust the federal excise tax on gasoline, and adjust the strategic petroleum reserve) and neither of those things actually has a major impact on gas prices, nudging them a few cents in one direction or another. The bulk of the increase throughout the Bush Administration was due to the war in Iraq and nervousness amongst futures traders about the supply of oil. The huge and sudden drop in oil prices at the end of 2008 was because Saudi Arabia unilaterally decided to flood the market with oil. The Iraq war was definitely an American policy forcing, but it was an indirect force that could easily have been mitigated by OPEC if they'd chosen to do so."
dcorhs5,DemonB7R,"Well we have this little thing called winter, where a lot of oil and gas are burned to provide heat. Prices are going up, because inventories are expected to be lower. That, plus production has been slowed somewhat, so that's going to cause the price to move up as well."

dcorqpo,gizzardgullet,"> The only way that the energy industry makes more money is if the price of oil goes upor if they can extract existing oil for cheaper.

The CDC National Vital Statistics Report already tells us that. And the fact that it's not nearly as high as it's made out to be by the media is what proves it's not the huge problem they call it.[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_04.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr65/nvsr65_04.pdf)"

dcowgxm,kremes,"The question was how many people **die** from gun violence so you're asking a different question entirely.

I think before we can get accurate numbers on that we need laws forcing them to report accurately, and auditing of their reporting obviously.Suicides is listed in that CDC report on page 44. 21,334 in 2014, numbers for 2013 are similar. Suicides make up the large majority of deaths with a gun."
dcozwfe,ILikeLenexa,"The question as how should we legislate to lower the amount of gun violence.We paid for a database on police shooting, but self reporting is optional and most departments opt not to. No one has these statistics a few newspapers tried to put together numbers this year.It's 2017. There's a few years missing there."
dcp5l5m,kremes,"No, actually the question was how many people die. Don't move the goalposts now. Here let me quote it for you.> if there weren't any numbers on **how many people die from gun violence**And the question should be **IF** we should legislate it. You're assuming we should, which isn't a very good assumption given just how tiny of a percentage of deaths it is based on the data we have.I agree on police and said as much, but that's a barely related issue.I know what year it is. CDC reports lag behind, that's how it works. CDC's **Preliminary** report for 2015 births was just released in June of 2016, as was the Final Data for deaths for 2014. Research and data aggregation take time.Regardless, the comment was clearly attempting to perpetuate that stupid ban on research myth, which only people who haven't even bothered to google it believe.Gun violence is a very minor issue.

dcoo1rf,JayReddt,"The one thing I disagree with:Americans don't enjoy long commutes. Many would love public transport options. It just isn't in the cards for a country our size. There are issues with freight trains owning railroads. Issues with where to build tracks things (certainly most are against eminent domain but then tracks are inefficient). There is the pure size of the US that makes anything outside major cities or areas with major cities close to one another very difficult to get public transport options.I'm hoping for driverless cars (and therefore taxis, buses or some specialized fleet) to save the day there. Because we are a country that realistically needs cars and roads for many to function. Much of the US is not a city and we can't all just be crammed in cities anyhow.Plus some people dislike the city life even if it would allow for public transport."
dcopdmc,felesroo,"Yes, people can be crammed into cities if they are designed well. But that would mean living around people who are different colors and suburbanites really don't like that. There was a white flight from cities after the war and the people in these HOAs and gated communities want to keep it that way. Yes, they DO like long commutes because it means they can live on their half acre of grass in their McMansion with other people like them.Driverless cars do not solve any energy issue unless they are electric. The problem isn't whether people are driving them or not.The size of the US isn't a problem either. Most people don't need to regularly travel long distances. Our regional transport is abysmal though and what we've got is old and slow.The US hasn't made enough significant investment in its public infrastructure. Traveling in the US after having been in anywhere else in the developed world is really eye-opening. US roads are terrible and expensive, the subways and trains are a joke... it's rightly compared to a third world country already. Americans just don't know it because they don't travel enough.No, Americans don't like public transit because it goes against their idea of freedom. City dwellers do, but city dwellers aren't really the problem. They have a lower carbon footprint (smaller homes, use cars less, tend to be less far, etc.) than do suburban and rural residents."

dcp41n1,Revlis-TK421,"Living in the city is astronomically more expensive than living further away. Here in the SF Bay you would be lucky to get a 2-bedroom apartment for $4600 a month. I couldn't afford to live in the city even if I wanted to. I couldn't even afford to live in Redwood City which, along with East Palo Alto, are sort of the armpits of the Peninsula. Even here rent is $4000 a month for a 2 bedroom.I live in the East Bay, work on the Peninsula. I cannot afford to rent, let alone buy, on the Peninsula. Hell, if I hadn't have bought the property we're in for the absolute steal we got it for I couldn't even afford to rent where I am today. And that's with dual professional incomes. So that means I get to commute.Most of the Bay is not HOA and gated communities. Sure there are plenty of them here but there is a whole lot of normal, old housing as well. We are all commuting somewhere, HOA or no. No one here likes the commute. 1.5 hours each way just to go 30 miles. It's not fun but see above. There's no choice.Public transit is great. For those that happen to live and work where it services. Sure, I could take the bus to BART, BART to south SF, and then CalTrain down to my job. If I didn't mind it taking 3 hours each way. I tried it for a week. Spending 1/4 of my existence on public transit is not cool.You are right that the infrastructure sucks. But that isn't going to change any time soon. Not even if you threw billions at it. Why? Because between eminent domain battles (there's no place to build new corridors even if we had the money) and endless environmental impact studies it just can't happen. I would be the first to volunteer for higher taxes if it meant another mid-bay bridge with BART tubes. We need that, a doubling of tracks, dozens of new stations, quadrupling of cars, bringing BART down into south Milpitas and south Mountain View, connecting the 237 loop, and seemless integration with both VTA and CalTrain before public transit became a viable enough option to make a difference around here. Short of that then coordinated, driverless, electric cars are really the only viable solution here. It's individualized mass transit. Even if $50B got thrown at solving the public transit problem here in the Bay today, driverless electric cars will be the norm before they'd be able to finish building the first new BART station."

dcov2wc,AthloneRB,>The US science and industry will be surpassed by nations who prioritize green energy and environmental research. This will make America less relevant moving forward and it's population sicker and poorer.Highly debatable. There's a lot more to national progress than prioritizing green energy and environmental research. The notion that these things alone are enough to carry a country ahead of the United States despite the many advantages the USA has over the rest of the world is a bit off.
dcoyvso,DaltonZeta,"Green Energy and environmental research are poised to be massive areas of industrial growth as more people transition to them over hydrocarbon energy sources. The US alone has a massive energy industry, and by disavowing that sector change, we lose out on the growth opportunities since the rest of the world is so interested in those technologies and their implementation. They aren't a sole factor that will alter the global landscape, but it's a sizable step. Energy production is what propelled several economies forward in their own right (Saudi Arabia and the UAE being good examples, limited by their size), Norway is also a good example of the capability of the energy sector to be a driving economic force. Similar commitments to the energy sector has the potential to alter the balance of economic power for an economy the size of China when compared to the US as an example. The US had the industrial and intellectual talent and capability to become an export power house in green technology. We're squandering that royally at the moment and leaving it for someone else to sell. There are a finite number of things we can competitively sell to other people (mostly high technology items and industries), and we're giving up one of the big pillars of that going forward in this century."
dcp2d19,AthloneRB,">The US had the industrial and intellectual talent and capability to become an export power house in green technology. We're squandering that royally at the moment and leaving it for someone else to sell. There are a finite number of things we can competitively sell to other people (mostly high technology items and industries), and we're giving up one of the big pillars of that going forward in this century.I don't understand this argument.Quite a few of the market leaders in green energy production today are American corporations, and they will continue to be American corporations regardless of who the president is. That technology will still be researched, developed, and exported by those companies, and the fruits of that will still be coming back to them. I don't see a reason to believe that American companies will not be benefitting from green energy/research when they are consistently among the global leaders in said research (and production in the case of who manufactures and engineers the turbines, solar panels, etc). Any advancement globally in the manufacture, research, and proliferation of green energy is going to have the likes of First Solar, Westinghouse, GE, and Evergreen among the leaders. These companies aren't about to quit being green energy/research leaders just because Trump took the white house. And all of this is aside from all of the foreign leaders in green energy (ex: Siemens) who have significant portions of their equity owned by American investors (meaning that their success comes back to those investors right here in the form of higher returns).The USA isn't giving up anything."
dcp3q7e,DaltonZeta,"They expanded large portions of those operations through incentives and government programs to my understanding. They're certainly not going to shutter those areas, but they're not exactly going to have the support of something like a corn subsidy going forward. Government investment, backing, and incentives has a lot of power in pushing growth more so than market forces alone. Other countries are expanding their own home-grown corporations preferentially in many cases. And pushing them forward with government backing (see China). I liken it to differing rates problems - in that our rate of rise will not be matching other countries because we are not investing as heavily at an institutional level. We'll continue rising, and will remain on top for a while, but other places making proportionally larger investments will see larger rates of growth in those industries and eventually may surpass our baseline. We're squandering the ability to use a dominant position to reinforce that dominance in tying the global industry to our own corporations/economy at this critical time in development/deployment while there's still room for massive expansion."
dcot1a2,,"Yes, because green energy and environmental research is the entirety of the scientific field. Nevermind fields such as Aerospace, Medicine, Computer Technologies, and pretty much everything military related that are poised to benefit greatly from the tax and regulatory policies of the coming administration. Just look at the recent investments from SoftBank and Apple (the SoftBank CEO specifically said that he would not have made the investment in a Hillary presidency). But you're right, the US is doomed because we'll research solar panels less than other countries."
dcovipq,felesroo,"We'll see. The US will continue to lead in computer software and hardware design, but it has a lot more competitors now and relies on foreign workers even now. The US educational system cannot keep pace with demand. The Chinese will soon have the only operational space station in orbit. The US medical system is pretty hobbled by runaway costs due to profit taking.The US is not as in competitive a position as it should be. Yeah, corporations will ""invest"" in the US to get tax breaks, but the benefits of that will go straight overseas. But there will be more low-paid jobs, so that's something, I guess."

dcopthr,felesroo,"Well, the Chinese government is regulating it, so that's where innovation will happen, and Americans will have to buy it from China because they will be way ahead the curve in terms of technology.American business doesn't innovate. It's late-stage capitalism. There's so little actual competition that it's cheaper for them to stay the course. Innovation is a risk and there's no need for them to take it. By the time they need to, it will be too late for them to catch up."
dcoqag5,YoungLegal,"We need some fixes to our capitalism I agree, and I highly doubt this is going to get any better under President Trump, but I think despite the monopolistic nature of our economy you are still underestimating American innovation. I just don't foresee other countries making huge green energy gains without significant contribution from American industry. And while it would be better if this industry had support from our government I still expect our green industry to do extremely well, even if most of our innovation is ""exported"" so to speak."

dcov8jz,NisslMissl,"Those vast regions in Eurasia that are just ripe for picking.That lovely continental climate that already produces harsh seasons, with hotter summers coming down the road will surely be sufficient to provide for humanities future. The regions nearer the poles will have the largest added seasonal temperature fluctuations due to climate change and the fluctuations are already massive. Canada and Russia aren't going to get much more fertile than they currently are."
dcp01bg,YoungLegal,"There are parts of the world that are too cold to be utilized and are mostly empty. These places will no longer be too cold if they get hotter. Does something confuse you here?Anyway, case in point is that global crises are good for nations that can survive them and bad for those that can't."
dcp3783,NisslMissl,"Fertile ground is not solely based on temperature. The majority of land area at higher latitudes is in Russia, so I'll focus on that for now.Almost a quarter of the land area in Russia is currently covered in peat lands, which are low in nutrients and not really useful soil for a lot of agricultural plants. On top of that though, they are really good carbon sinks. Peat land conversion in Malaysia (which is a different order of magnitude than what would be required for Russia) for example produces 60 tons of CO2 per hectare per year for 25 years. Then you have the boreal forests, which again, cover massive areas. These again, are nutrient poor and surprisingly again carbon sinks. On top of that, they are generally found in areas with low precipitation. Perfect for agriculture.So on top of the already catastrophic emissions that we are pretty much guaranteed from the melting of permafrost and those released in the east Siberian arctic shelf, the only way to actually farm the areas ""gained"" would be to convert peat lands and through massive deforestation, producing even more emissions. Now though, you've only got the land clear for agricultural use, you have yet to actually farm anything. Because of the nutrient poor soil you need fertilizers. The production of chemical fertilizers currently accounts for ~2% of global energy usage and uses natural gas as a hydrogen source for nitrogen fertilizer. I suppose one could potentially use water for the hydrogen, but I think one would be somewhat strapped for that, wanting to irrigate massive fields of crops in an area of low precipitation. Then we have the problem of sunlight and while there are more hours of sunlight per day at higher latitudes, the angle means that the sunlight hitting a certain area will actually provide less energy than nearer the equator. Maybe the extended hours cancel that out again, but I'd be rather surprised by that. Add to that the problems with infrastructure in areas where the ground freezes solid in winter due to the massive seasonal temperature range of such a continental climate and you're generally left with a situation that I would describe as less than ideal. It's a bit more complicated than > These places will no longer be too cold if they get hotter.I mean possibly the problems are manageable, but if we're unable to deal with climate change in anything resembling an effective response, I don't really see it happening when you add 50 crises."
dcp43pr,YoungLegal,"What do you think about sweating out the competition though, which is the crux of what I'm getting at. It looks like you know more about agriculture and shit, so lets say things are gonna get worse for mostly everyone, but the U.S. has the power to secure the most of the dwindling resources, which will allow us to further assert dominance over the world. Allowing global warming to continue seems to be a good strategy for weakening our adversaries in the Middle East as well as recolonizing Africa like China is beginning to do right now."
dcp54ff,NisslMissl,"Being king of the ashes sounds like a fantastic plan. What exactly is that going to do for the average american voter? Or even the plutocrats? I'm pretty sure we're all better off as individuals now than we're going to be if famine, mass migrations, resource scarcity and resulting wars become commonplace."
dcp5n0t,YoungLegal,"Conflict will continue on this planet as long as there is inequality among cultures, the EU and other globalists want to use global warming as a way to unify the world under a single western culture before oppositions gain nuclear power.Also ""King of Ashes"" is somewhat of an exaggeration. The west will be largely unharmed by global warming, only the 3rd world will be devastated; and if all goes to plan they will become dependent on the west for survival and we can finally move towards world peace with those opposed to western culture (almost exclusively muslims) too weak to resist."
dcp7hdk,NisslMissl,"So having looked at your post history, I rather regret starting this conversation with you, as my effort was likely wasted on someone who seems convinced of his intelligence and yet sports white supremacist rhetoric. Not saying that necessarily makes you dumb, just that my perception of the likelihood of you being convinced by rational arguments has decreased somewhat.But well, in for a penny, in for a pound. If you think the west will be unharmed by a **global temperature increase** of at the very least 2, more likely 3.5+ centigrade, I would implore you to read what climate scientists are actually saying. From your comments you seem to be around college age, so if you're at all considering ever having kids, please don't do so ignorant of the effects they will be dealing with. Hell, that you will be living with if you make it past 50.The California central valley will dry up. You've likely heard about the droughts and wildfires they've had recently. Those will worsen. As you likely also know, California is the most populous US state. The map I linked you earlier showed quite a large part of the US affected by desertification. You can't grow food in the desert. The areas highlighted on the map are pretty likely going to be completely barren within at most a century or two. And that's just one aspect. There's collapsing bio cascades, relocation of tropical viruses, heatwaves enhanced by el nino events that will kill tens of thousands of people,then there's unchecked mass migration, competition for resources and water shortages that will enhance the potential for conflict. And I don't just mean from outside the united states. What happens when parts of Florida get flooded and California has water shortages? You don't need any outsiders whatsoever for their migration to cause alarm. It seems I'm reaching pretty far across the aisle here, being an anti authoritarian socialist myself, speaking to someone who accused a reddit admin of being complicit in a child sex ring on /t_D and has made multiple askreddit threads asking why racism is wrong. So I'd be awfully appreciative if you would prove me wrong, that you will listen to rational arguments, even if it's just on this issue. There are very intelligent people on this planet who are concerned about the very existence of civilisation in just a few centuries. Please do me the favour of listening to a lecture or two, because you are seriously underestimating the potential for damage here."
dcpk3lt,YoungLegal,"As far as my post history is concerned;I'm a race realist, I believe there are significant biological differences between races, however I also believe that all human races are capable of coexisting in western culture. And discriminating against races isn't feasible and therefore detrimental to progress, but so is ignorance and blind acceptance. By the west being unharmed I largely mean that in a comparative sense. I believe pretty much everything you say regarding agricultural problems from global warming, you seem very educated on this matter. I do believe in human caused climate change, I've studied thermodynamics and the emission/absorption spectrum of gaseous CO2 is not something that eludes my understanding. The U.S after global warming compared to the U.S before will be weaker, BUT (only caps cause main point) THE US WILL BECOME COMPARATIVELY MORE POWERFUL AFTER GLOBAL WARMING THAN BEFORE. Millions of people in the third world will die, maybe only a few hundred thousand Americans will starve (high estimate imo). Now, even if we accept the most alarmist positions, say viruses break out and MILLIONS of Americans die and it is a global catastrophe, the west will still come out on top, and the worse the global catastrophe is, the larger importance military power has, and the greater dominance the west has.The entire middle east will become completely dependent on the west for survival, and this will finally begin to end anti-western sentiment, and this is one way that world peace can be obtained under western culture; which I believe is crucial for the advancement and survival of our species. As far as my Donald postings. I don't think spez is involved in pizzagate, and I don't believe in pizzagate anyways; I just like to rile up the crowd. As a general conclusion so you understand where I'm coming from. I believe nothing matters more than the advancement and survival of our human species, and that the western culture is the way in which we should progress. I do not value individual human life in this context, especially those who oppose western culture. I think socialism can and will eventually work, but only when there are enough resources to ensure everyone of a satisfactory life, which I don't see being possible unless the earth progresses under a single western culture. And I see global warming as a great way to influence the change towards a western culture."

Actions speak louder than words, and actions tell us that the world is definitely not in some other league relative to the USA on these issues. They're either promoting failing policies or actively contradicting pro-environmentalist rhetoric.And claiming that there is some huge economic cost here to be paid for failing to take a more environmentalist stance on climate change is wishful thinking. The anti-climate change/anti-environmentalist path is the profitable one, not the environmentalist path. This is precisely why it is so hard to get powers that be to support environmentalist policies that are concerned with climate change - it is more economically expedient to ignore it. Environmental awareness/climate change action is the hard route, not the easy one. It is the route that asks for higher costs, not lower ones.

Of course I - and most of my peers - know climate change is real and support renewables. The demand for cheap energy is only going to continue rising, and adding more wind, solar, nuclear, etc. to the mix is beneficial to the species and our continued prosperity. You're still going to need oil for fertilizers, plastic, natural gas for heating, etc., albeit to a lesser extent. If I can do my part to ensure that oil is safely and efficiently extracted and reduce any spills or disasters, I have an ethical obligation to do so. Climate change needs to be taken seriously, but that doesn't mean oil and natural gas are going to disappear entirely for a long time, since they are still needed for *many* things other than electricity and vehicles. It would help if people realized that maybe, just *maybe*, we aren't all in this business to do harm.

dcopxiw,PencilvesterStallone,"No, I just changed .02% to its decimal form of .0002. I was about to do some calculations so I just changed it. .02%,.0002, 1/5000. However you want to look at it."
dcoq1bp,belgiumwaffles,"Still. I was stunned when I first heard it. Of all the things to cut, they go for that? Why not reduce some of the trillions spent on the military?"

I'd always thought I should adopt instead of making new children, but my wife wanted one with our genes, so I leaned in that direction. Then within an hour it wasn't even a choice anymore. My wife and I are such a good match that we didn't even need to communicate with each other for us to both know it wasn't a good choice anymore. What kind of world are they going to have to grow up in? We're just going to do our best to adopt and care for children that are already stuck with this world."

dcow9zq,bontesla,Congratulations on your pregnancy! People like Trump and his ilk have always existed. Will always exist. Don't let them win. Don't let them stop you from achieving your happiness. Achieve it in spite of them. Achieve it in defiance of them. The pregnancy belongs to your wife and you. You get to determine the terms in which you choose to have it or not. I'm choosing not to have kids because my ethics won't allow it with climate change. But you get to have your own ethics and make your own decisions. That's how you defeat what Trump represents.
dcoy9vl,goodolarchie,"Thanks. We won't let them win, we can't. We've always fought this kind of thing, the environment is our #1 issue and something she has dedicated her life toward. It just makes us feel bad about bringing a child into this world.We were both born when Reagan was in office, that's what I told her."
dcp103i,InfanticideAquifer,"That's a fine choice that I respect. But the heatmaps of ""reddit users"" and ""people who won't be nearly as affected by global warming as most people will"" look really similar. If you live in a first-world country things'll be okayish. The real tragedy is the billion-ish people who will die in the developing world. The ocean could literally wash over the entirety of Florida and, if you lived anywhere in the US other than Florida, you'd just be annoyed that your taxes went up and that Florida refugees were driving on your roads. Life might get harder, but I don't think a life with really expensive food and gasoline is a life that isn't worth living. The people in countries where society will collapse, where people will wait in line for 12 hours for food that isn't even there. Those people seem like the ones with a big global warming related reason to avoid having children. (Apologies, of course, if you *are* from one of those countries.

dcor4as,corylulu,"Yeah, but if they are underpopulated, it kinda just leaves the next generation doublely fucked and giving them a greater burden when we all get old / retire to both subsidize and care for us while also dealing with the effects of climate change. It would just be yet another burden to inflicted on them. And even if it's well intended, it ultimately will seem like a selfish decision made by us. Much like how baby boomers are a disproportionately overpopulated generation, the effect works the same way in reverse, just without the one generation delay. We'll end up just like them. Old, out of touch and a burden to the working class, but still have greater political representation and will likely ignore future threats that don't affect our generation the same way baby boomers did with climate change."

Whether or not I reproduce is going to be irrelevant. And as nice as you may be - I do not love you enough to have a child for the purposes of taking care of you. I do not love you enough to burden my child with the effects of climate change. I would have loved to have children. But we, as a nation, have decided against stopping climate change. And I have to respond to that as ethically as I can."
dcorzqd,corylulu,"Not trying to tell you, personally, to have a kid. I'm just stating that the *attitude* itself, if held by enough people, is potentially dangerous and people should know why. Just the idea that people are saving a child from being born into the world shouldn't be their motivator because it's then that person who is the burden come later in life. If someone doesn't wanna have kids, nobody is forcing them, but people should fool themselves into believing a self-righteous, but misguided, justification as to why."

GHGs like CO2 retain energy from the sun, there's more GHGs, so more energy is retained. How it all manifests itself in an extremely complicated system is tough to understand, but the premise is high school level science."
dconuaw,,[deleted]
dcoo6rg,dankmanbearpig,Unfortunately true.
dcopeud,Ridley413,"I've always thought not believing in global warming is funny because the basic mechanisms of the greenhouse effect are involved in so many things we experience in our daily lives. If you don't believe in thermal radiation, why does your electric stove glow? How can you feel radiant heat off of hot things? Does your IR thermometer not work? If matter doesn't absorb photons, how does your microwave work exactly? Does it not heat your food? Why do you see different colors?"
dcopzmq,Mark_Knopfler,"Please don't take this the wrong way, but that's so simplified that its misleading, if not entirely untrue. The system is too complicated and requires so much data and scientific understanding to really explain that the only people who are actually able to understand the system are the actual scientists studying it. I am at work but if I remember later I can maybe give you some examples of how simplifying the system to this level is dangerous as it presents an easily debunked strawman to climate deniers rather than a robust field of work."
dcpgjdd,dankmanbearpig,"Go ahead, send a few links. In all honesty though, there needs to be a concerted effort from those studying climate science to develop an elevator pitch of how it works in a very simplified manner. Showing the relationship between atmospheric concentration of GHGs and average annual temperature seems to have no effect on those who are skeptical."
dcpgte5,Mark_Knopfler,"I'm actually working on doing just that with a friend. I have a PhD in isotope geochemistry, and he studies paleoclimate. Honestly scientists are failing the general populace in terms of communicating the science, but to be fair it is incredibly difficult to explain the entire system without handwaving and basically just saying 'you have to trust me'. Even with 10 years of higher education I am not really an expert in climate change: I understand very clearly how to use isotope systems to tell time and explain some geochemical and geobiochemical processes. Thats it, and its a small piece of the climate picture. The general populace, or even a theoretical particle physicist, so anyone who isn't a geochemist, basically has to have faith in academia, science, and 'consensus' among those scientists. I honestly dont know what the solution is, but if I can get some funding I think it would be a worthwhile project."
dcokxqo,f_d,"I want to temper that comment slightly. People *need* more open avenues of information where they can at least see and hear *why* scientists are so committed to their process and their findings. Going up against a denier in a rigged debate isn't the answer, but people who are genuinely wondering who to believe do need help understanding at some level what is going on. They don't have enough reasons in their limited experience to give those scientists that trust.Unfortunately, most of the avenues of communication that reach them are tightly controlled by manipulators."

The LGBT page was a page about President Obama and the LGBT community, and wasn't even created until over a year into Obama's presidency. When there's a handover like this, all the pages from the previous administration are archived, and the new administration starts adding their own. The archive is at [ObamaWhiteHouse.gov](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/)[There's a Snopes page on it](http://www.snopes.com/white-house-web-site-trump-changes/). That;s not to say we shouldn't worry, we absolutely should. But we shouldn't worry about this, because this is not a thing. We should worry about the stuff he ends up putting down there when he does, and we should worry about his policies, his incompetance, his supreme court choices, his ties to Russia, his sexual assault lawsuits, and so on and so on.

If you are unconvinced by the science, then you don't know anything about science. Scientists all overwhelmingly agree on the science. If 98 doctors tell me I have cancer, I don't respond ""well the science isn't conclusive and these 2 other doctors said they had no idea what it was, so it's probably nothing"" This is Galileo being persecuted for thinking the Earth revolves around the sun level shit.

We can go that direction, but we need vast improvements to our infrastructure, both in manufacturing capability and grid improvements.ORRRRR we could embrace technological advancements in nuclear technology over the last 40 years and go Nuclear! It's really the best option. It's green. It produces VERY little waste. It's safe with the right precautions. And it will basically provide us with unlimited energy forever.

The fact that he doesn't believe in/doesn't want to publicize/doesn't want to focus on those things won't make them exist more or less, and will hardly change the population's view on those issues.Sure, it's appaling that he feels it's important to remove the mentions, but it's still far from a big deal. Now, if he takes actions that completely disregard global warming, or discriminates races/sexes, or actually tries to remove ACA; *then* I'll say that something has to be done.

With that being said it's refreshing to see a reasonable mind who believes deeply in the issue who isn't a zealot about it. Hopefully it works out for all of us.

dcopvoc,Nuranon,"I think if things take a turn for the worst we will see efforts to do Research via ESA, meaning that NASA will make research, know-how etc and possibly staff available to ESA or start some wonky cooperatives with California which cooperates with ESA or so to allow international cooperation when the federal goverment doesn't want it to happen.Giving money to ESA to do stuff will be more difficult (if the federal goverment doesn't want it to happen) but I could see this to *some* also go via California - ESA builts an satellite, NASA wants certain instruments on there, California funds the instruments and related costs so that the guys at the Ames research Center and the Jet Propulsion Lab (whoever's job it is) can built the stuff.I guess american launch providers could suffer but I think DoD launches will continue and I doubt even a Republican Congress would stop ISS launches from happening and many launches are commercial satellites anyway.To trade stuff is also not uncommon - Europe (~~Italy I believe~~ Airbus in Germany, thanks u/Turminder_Xuss) builts or will build the Orion Service module, in teh future this was supposed to be a way to share development and production costs and allow a trade like 1 seat in orion for one service module...NASA could try to change those deals - so that NASA pays for the Service module, ESA pays some insignificant sum for the seat and ""happens"" to start a new earth observation satellite with tech support from ~~NASA~~ the university of california."
dcou2va,Turminder_Xuss,"> Europe (Italy I believe) builts or will build the Orion Service moduleThat would be Airbus Defense and Space from Bremen, Germany.And yes, the Ariane 5 is the finest medium lift vehicle known to man, and California would be very welcome to buy launches."

dcotgc8,CheMoveIlSole,"See my above comment. If California decided to purchase a foreign made satellite, and have that satellite launched from a foreign territory as overseen by SpaceX, would that implicate ITAR concerns? It doesn't seem like it would."
dcotphy,sbeloud,"Im not sure. ITAR is very complicated and covers many aspects.They cant even hire people from other countries without jumping through huge hoops, I doubt they would just let your situation happen with no issues.Edit:why even involve spacex at all?"
dcotsur,CheMoveIlSole,Because the above regulations would clearly apply. I'm trying to think of a way that California could launch a climate research satellite without necessitating U.S. federal government approval. It seems like the best route to go would be to buy a European-made satellite and have that satellite launched from a territory outside of the United States.
dcotx2b,sbeloud,"Yea, that is the only way. Ignore my other comment."
dcou3f0,CheMoveIlSole,"Thank you for the help and clarification, though."
dcotvjq,sbeloud,Just to be clear when you say overseen by spacex do you mean that they are using a spacex rocket in another country? That is absolutely against ITAR. If not then I fall back to why involve spacex?
dcou5b1,CheMoveIlSole,"No, I meant overseen by SpaceX personnel. I suppose their involvement wouldn't be strictly necessary but it does seem like they know their business even if the launch isn't using one of their rockets. Perhaps they could just be advisers to the governor."
dcopvux,mspk7305,Can you send me an example of any private company that has performed a space launch from any location outside the borders of the country in which they originated?
dcoqz03,CheMoveIlSole,"I'd be happy to look into it. I'm guessing Europe might be a good place to start. The essential point remains, though: what law prohibits a US based space company from launching a foreign made satellite from a territory outside of the United States?"
dcorxa5,mspk7305,The International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
dcosjrm,CheMoveIlSole,> The International Traffic in Arms Regulations.I'll check it out. Thanks!Edit: perhaps I'm missing something. ITAR would cover the export of technologies or products but that's not what I'm proposing. The State of California would buy the satellite and have it launched from a foreign territory. Only the launch site would be in a foreign country. A company like SpaceX could oversee the launch. Thoughts on the above?
dcow2s0,mspk7305,Why would SpaceX oversee a launch of a vehicle they did not build?
dcp31u9,CheMoveIlSole,"Or advise in some capacity. The point being that California has the technical knowledge necessary to buy, have built, and launch a satellite."
dcp3a0q,mspk7305,You have changed topics three times now.

dcozfcr,RayWencube,"If you aren't religious, then prayer is going to be meaningless for you. The point of it is to bring you closer to God, which in turn helps you better live as you believe He would want you to. It wouldn't make sense for someone who actively doesn't believe in God, and who doesn't want to believe in God, to pray."
dcoznnt,Thysios,"Aka nothing. Other than furthering someones delusions. A placebo at best. As apparently it only works for people who believe it works.

The hypocrisy and contradictions. How people believe something with literally 0 proof is beyond me. And still believe after evidence comes ojut to suggest otherwise.I guess when you realise people pick and choose which parts to believe and follow it starts to make a bit more sense. But still..."
dcozs0q,RayWencube,That's..just..an avalanche of assumptions and gross generalizations.
dcp00g9,Thysios,"Then feel free to counter my post.Apparently praying is pointless and does nothing if you don't believe in God. If god is real it shouldn't matter whether you believe or not, as he would still exist.Having an old book that says a few things isn't the same as proof. Not being able to proof there isn't a God isn't proof that there is. The burden of proof is on the person making the claim.There is plenty of evidence out there that counters claims made by the millions of religions out there. And those that do still believe it some how manage to ignore all the bad stuff that goes with the religion.

dcp4q2m,I_Photoshop_Movies,That's actually a real problem. It's not ignorance. Many people actually pray and hope things would happen. Smart Christians know it doesn't change anything and praying is more for inner strength sort of like meditation.

""oh please god, give me the strength to not be an awful person!"" or ""look at this sunrise, you're a good god, thank you"". Face it.

I don't wanna seem harsh... it's cool, you're free to believe whatever you want. No one should limit your freedom to believe anything you want, even if it seems like nonsense.But would *you* ever want someone that believes in what appears to be complete nonsense... deciding policy that could ruin the planet you live on?

Most humans have a longing to believe in something greater than themselves, whether that's God or universal interconnectedness (a la Carl Sagan and ""star stuff"") or ""the power of love."" It's because we have questions for which there are no answers.

First, congress is mostly Christian because America is mostly Christian. Second, when an atheist or a scientologist isn't elected, it isn't because voters vote with their faith. I'm telling you this as someone with a graduate degree in political psychology. Third, being Christian (or a member of *any* faith) does *not* mean that one's faith is the only consideration one has. It does not follow that a Congress full of Christians will create a Christian Theocracy. For a real world example of that--look around you: do we have a Christian Theocracy? Are you required to worship Jesus? Are you required to go to church? Are you banned from getting a divorce? Do you go to jail for cheating on your spouse? Are you required to observe *any* religious law? Yes, there are religious zealots in politics who would like to criminalize homosexuality and adultery and all other manner of religious doctrine, but that does not mean that being Christian (or Jewish or Muslim or Hindu) means that a legislator will attempt to create a Christian (or Jewish or Muslim or Hindu) nation. > And.....there's your scoffYes, I scoff at any form of bigotry.

dcux5vl,esantipapa,">Which review them for writing style, not scientific merit. Publishers do review for literary merit, and often decide not to publish terrible works. But that's not the same I suppose.I mean the circumstances that make you YOU are arbitrary. Most religious beliefs are a reflection of pretty basic circumstances... where a person was born or whom their parents are, what their parents believe. And these arbitrary circumstances you appreciate apparently. That's cool. >If I can't get a solid answer regarding fundamental questions about our existence, I can't just somehow make those questions not relevant to my life. Is it so hard to accept that ultimately you really don't matter and you have no purpose other than that you choose? Do you really need to conjure up a creator of the universe to find meaning in your existence? (if that's what you do) Does that level of self-centeredness never dawn on you (if not for yourself, but for others)? The most powerful being in the universe not only exists, but it cares about *every* decision you make. (broadly speaking, that mindset applies to a lot of religions, if not yours... cool)The qualifier you desire is one you had already agreed to, e.g. when their faith informs/controls/guides/writes policy decisions. In good conscience, when someone explains they will govern guided by faith (see recent Presidential Republican Primary for prime examples), shouldn't that scare folks? I would hope their faith is the last thing on their mind when making policy decisions that happen to decide whether people will live or die, especially when those people may not believe in an afterlife whatsoever?I took the oath of service in the military, it does contain [the ""So Help me god"" portion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_help_me_God#United_States), but it is now optional... How kind! So when I opt out of it, everyone I'm about to serve with can see I opted out and thus don't share their religious beliefs, despite a strong, personal commitment to serve my country. But that's ok, I guess? Since I'm in the minority?>You believe God is made up. That doesn't make it true.There are plenty of made up things large groups of people believe without evidence, that doesn't make them true either. It just makes them popular.You're right, I don't know your religion. Though, whatever it is, I do hope you don't force it on others, seek converts, or involve it in politics. Humanity has more than plenty of it, wildly abused in some places, as is evidenced by Iran.And with that, I wish you personal peace and happiness, for as long as you live. LLAP"

dcotqlk,Zuwxiv,"I think you were being quite fair and /u/raywencube is protecting some insecurities.Maybe ""magic"" is somehow derogative? Maybe supernatural or divine are less offensive. What kind of power does God (or whatever religion someone follows) have?In purely anthropological terms, prayer is a religious ritual whereby someone attempts to communicate with a dirty or ancestors, frequently in order to request divine assistance or forgiveness.I wonder if magic's pejorative meaning has something to do with perspective. My religion has miracles, yours are magic. Or magic is unexplained, while my miracles are attributed to prayer. I can explain my magic with religion, they can't explain their magic. I don't know."
dcou9ke,Reddit_beard,"Thanks for being reasonable. I purposefully use terms like magic to highlight how strange and foreign some religious practices seem to people looking in from the outside. As you said, magic, divine, miracle, they're all the same thing."
dcp07b9,Zuwxiv,"Cool beans! I had a project in school for an anthropology class to study rituals in a religious area. It was supposed to be a religious building not of our own religion. The idea was partly to think about the rituals in your own life and religion, how they shape your thoughts and actions.I asked to do my report on a totally non-religious place: The student center. I wanted to look into all the rituals we have in daily life that are bizarre, unspoken, and yet followed religiously. How do people know the study room is a study room, after they took the sign off last year?Why do people stand a certain distance from the ATM, when there is no line or division to see?Why do people get on the bus by sitting along next to the window back to front, and only will sit next yo someone when all single seats are exhausted?When you start looking, you realize so much of your life is filled with rituals you were never taught, never question, and always follow. It is very hard to look from the outside in when you were always on the inside.So glad the professor allowed me to do that."
dcoy2pk,RayWencube,"I'm not sure what insecurities I'm protecting. I absolutely believe that prayer has a meaningful, positive impact on the lives of religious people. I also absolutely believe that prayer can be used as a means to excuse oneself from actually taking action. I also absolutely believe that if I pray for the Cubs to win another (holy shit) World Series or for the Free Syrian Army to give Bashar al Assad the business, I'm probably going to be the recipient of a divine ""go fuck yourself."" I am not so arrogant that I believe I can will God to take my side or to alter the world around us in some way I prefer.

If you'd like to divulge it I'd be happy to discuss it specifically. Unless it's an obscure one the odds are good I've read your holy book cover to cover and categorically rejected it. In the meantime, I lul at you thinking you've scored a point by mentioning I don't know what you've yet to share about yourself."

dcoqg76,Schnectadyslim,I mean if you look at the topics that are missing it definitely appears purposeful but we shall see.
dcoqafy,AlphaAnt,I refuse to believe his group inadvertently removed all references to climate change if they intend to have some. That was a deliberate decision.
dcoup9l,creedofwheat,"I think it's an organized and purposeful shift of focus. I assume the justification would be that he doesn't need to defend it or provide references when there is ""no definite proof"" of it. It'd essentially be one of those things that can only change with a new administration or pushing for compromise with his policies. Which sucks cause #science, yo.I honestly couldn't tell you if he truly doesn't believe in climate change or just said that for garnering votes (likely the former though). Nonetheless, He emphasizes the job creation (bringing back old jobs with it) it will provide. I also believe he wants to work on clean energy and water technology development at the same time for business purposes.Plus his focus is cleaning our own environment, not the world's (and yes, it's redundant based on coal/fracking). He's taking the stance that no matter what initiatives we put in place, countries like China will still contribute to climate change... Why put money in to keep the neighborhood's grass green when they don't even mow it? So we might as well focus on our own backyard. Plus the tariffs he puts in place would promote manufacturing jobs to return to the US, which has stricter environmental guidelines. So technically he can say his initiatives actually helped fight climate change... and you can sure as bet he will say it around 2-3 years from now.I pretty much don't think he cares whether or not climate change is real or not. It's a political move, as the worse thing that can happen is things will remain the same. The best thing to happen is the development of clean energy that provides a not addition of jobs when we no longer rely on coal, etc.If my interpretation's right then it makes sense... but I don't agree with it. Yet it's also just an interpretation... so I could be wrong. If I'm right then the goal would be develop the clean energy as fast as possible rather then let any potential progress stall and fester with red tap.It would be easier if he believed in impact of climate change, though."

dcpqwwb,xahnel,"Climate change isn't one of his priorities. Regardless of its veracity, it has been used to perpetrate an enormous scam on the American taxpayer. Know how I know this? Within the last year, the UN came out with a 'plan' to fight climate change that was projected to have an enormous cost. It's projected beneficial impact? A reduction by a single degree within the next century.You want to know the actual way to push environmentalist behavoir in such a way that people choose to be green en masse? Make it affordable. Make them *better and cheaper* than the dirty alternative, not just greener. Just being green is a statement made by those who can afford the high cost of making it.Oh, and when [someone tries to build a solar farm in the middle of the desert](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/business/businessspecial2/24shrike.html), don't protest because a specific species of tortoise might be somehow affected by it."
dcprvxc,RayWencube,">It's projected beneficial impact? A reduction by a single degree within the next century.I get the sense you don't know much about climate science. A single degree shift is *enormous.* It doesn't mean that instead of being 70 degrees out it is now 71. It refers to average surface temperature. [And one degree warmer puts us on the path to catastrophe](http://www.livescience.com/10325-living-warmer-2-degrees-change-earth.html).>You want to know the actual way to push environmentalist behavoir in such a way that people choose to be green en masse? Make it affordable. Make them better and cheaper than the dirty alternative, not just greenerThat is what government subsidies for research are trying to accomplish"
dcpsqe3,xahnel,"No, no. You aren't quite understanding. This wasn't a degree Celsius. This was a fraction of a degree celsius. It was a degree in Fahrenheit.And according to climate projections, we'll have passed that two degree threshold anyways (if current trends continue) before the proposed plan would have ever had an effect. So, if the plan is essentially projected to fail, the fuck is the point of trying to impose it on people?Simple: you're being played. The government has never cared. The UN certainly doesn't care. They are using your fears and concerns to enrich themselves, give themselves more power and control, now, and fuck the future, because by then, they'll be dead. A good example of this is treating CO^2 as a pollutant. Literally every member of the animal kingdom exhales the shit. You don't realize how much power it gives a government to label your breath a pollutant. Once you personally are a polluter, you can be subjected to pollution regulation. And the worst part is that studies done on plant life suggests that plants are actually starved for CO^2. That a doubling or tripling of the PPM (which, at last googling, was somewhere in the 200 PPM range) would allow for hardier, faster growing plants that require less sun and water. Some greenhouses artificially increase the amount of CO^2 to get more out of their plants. This isn't a pollutant, this is the oxygen of plants, but we're striving to reduce the amount in the air constantly. This makes plants weaker. It makes them guzzle more water, need more time in the sun, makes them weaker to disease.And you can't rely on government subsidies for research (at least, not the ones that go to companies). Look at the most famous example, Solyndra. Obama pumped quite a lot of taxpayer cash into the company, only for it to fold like Vegas tourist with a pair of twos. I'd much rather that money go to university or military research into the problem. Better chances of success that way. After all, a university won't collapse if it can't crack cheap solar."
dcopsdh,ribagi,"It took 8 years to get everything Obama wanted up. There is a large number of policies that Trump supports that isn't even up there. But I WANT TO BE OUTRAGED, right?"
dcowi14,zugunruh3,Are you fucking high? Obama's White House site was up [the day of the inauguration](http://web.archive.org/web/20090120204553/http://www.whitehouse.gov/) and contained 24 policy pages. Trump's has 6.
dcoxmb1,ribagi,"He has 6 up *now*. But I guest if you are looking for outrage you'll find it anywhere.So I guest I can fake outrage too, omg obama doesn't care about [afghanistan](http://web.archive.org/web/20090204234622/http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/afghanistan/)!"
dcoxvay,zugunruh3,"Yes, he's up to 6 *now*, at the exact same time during Obama's transition when Obama had 24 policy pages that looked like they were written by someone more literate than Jaden Smith.PS, had you bothered to actually look on the website instead of randomly appending words to the end of whitehouse.gov you would see that Obama [actually did](http://web.archive.org/web/20090122232555/http://www.whitehouse.gov/agenda/foreign_policy/) have a policy page that discussed Afghanistan."
dcoxzzb,ribagi,So on the 22nd he had it up but not on the 20th? Stop this fake outrage.
dcoy1db,zugunruh3,"The 22nd is the closest archive of that particular page on archive.org, you can see if you look on the archive for the main page from the 20th that the link is there. If you want to insist it was a dead link for 2 days it's on you to prove it."
dcoybnf,ribagi,I guest you are unable to see the wider point I am trying to make. Just because there isn't a link to your pet idea doesn't imply that in the future your pet idea won't have a link towards it.
dcoyffc,zugunruh3,"Nope, not good enough. This is the public face of his administration, not having it up and running with extensive policy pages on day 1 when he has this many resources at his fingertips and this much time to prepare is simply unacceptable."

I'm kind of tired trying to go on Reddit for some light browsing of entertaining stuff and seeing all this shit. I'm getting more doom and gloom then I got the ridiculous the_donald posts.

Keep up with that denialist, anti-intellectual attitude."
dcoyi20,ribagi,"It isn't me who is redirecting. It is you. It is unreasonable to compare two websites, one 8 years old another 10 hours old, in all ways. I am not an American either, so keep up your anti-intellectual attitude and ad hominems. ffs I am trying to be reasonable here."
dcoyqrj,kshatriiya,"That is exactly why I asked what amount of time we should give Donald Trump before he clarifies his stands on Paris agreement and climate change. Yes, it is reasonable to expect him to be VERY prepared even on his inauguration day because he is the US president, presidency is a full time job and there is a whole world out there who needs him to address these important issues with urgency, this is not an issue we can give him 8 years for. I asked you a reasonable question but you didn't answer."
dcoz0mh,ribagi,The world is not often black and white. I can tell you now that expecting him to have a webpage for every issue you care about 10 hours after being the president is unreasonable. Calling people anti-intellectuals and a denialist because you are called out for being rash does not strengthen your case.
dcoz75s,kshatriiya,"I did not expect him to have every issued outlined on the site, I did ask you what would be the reasonable time frame to expect but I still haven't gotten an answer. That is saying something about your attitude.Besides, things like LGBT issues aren't something he should need to rethink over. Massive progress has been made under Obama for that. What is taking him so long eh?I think it'd be better to be straight forward about where each of us stand with regards to climate change, LGBT etc. It might also highlight why we maybe pro or anti trump."
dcots1h,Lt-SwagMcGee,Calm down. Dude hasn't even been president for a day yet.
dcoxpw5,RayWencube,Are you suggesting he is going to pull a complete 180 on everything he's ever said about climate change and actually pursue a course of action aimed at reducing greenhouse emissions and slowing climate change?
dcpcy02,Lt-SwagMcGee,"Not completely, but I assume he plans on addressing it as it is a serious issue. Just because it got deleted doesn't mean he is never going to replace it. Give him and his team to get everything updated. This shit literally happens in every transition but for some reason you people are only making a big deal of it now."

dcp1f2c,TheyAreAllTakennn,"You got a better idea? The entire world has been converting to democracies for a reason. We realized the flaws of democracy from the country's inception, that's why we made the Electoral College. Of course we are pro democracy, it's not perfect but you would be a fool to disregard it as a failed system. Until there is an alternative that ensures the people in charge are both smart and good people, that somehow eliminates corruption even over time, democracy is somewhat unfortunately the best option."
dcp1t9a,SrsSteel,"Yea, get rid of the electoral college.."
dcp3ot8,TheyAreAllTakennn,"I think you missed the point, while I somewhat agree with you, the electoral college is actually what op wants as he thinks you should take away power form the everyday citizen in favor of supposedly smarter people. The electoral college is the compromise we came up with, though it doesn't work because we still need to elect people to the electoral college to prevent them from taking over the country, which means they will do anything we want them to in order to be reelected.A better idea, in my opinion, would be to keep the electoral college, but completely clean it every election, so that they are guaranteed not to get the position next year allowing them to free up their conscience and do what they feel is right, while preventing powerhungry people form wanting the position in the first place since it only lasts for one election."
dcp4buq,SrsSteel,The electoral colleges flaw is that it's based on states and statistically favors people from states with less population. I don't think cleaning the electoral college would fix that issue
dcp4rh8,TheyAreAllTakennn,"That's a minor issue compared to most, but you aren't wrong."
dcp8czo,geeuurge,"Your talking points are that you (as in the USA) invented the electoral college system to hopefully attract a higher level of conversation among your electing population, and that democracy ensures both a meritocracy and a low level of corruption. Please feel free to change my view, but none of this seems to be the case currently."
dcp8vqm,TheyAreAllTakennn,"The idea was we would have a set of people who's job it was to be more informed than the average citizen has the time to be, and then these people would act as a safeguard in situations where they know for a fact that the citizens made a bad choice.And no, it has not proven to work yet. I believe adjusting it so that each elector can only serve for one election would fix the corruption and the loyalty issues with the current Electoral College.And again, we all realize democracy is flawed, this is not some revelation of yours, but we have yet to discover a better system of government that is effective on such a large scale. So, I'm asking again, do you have a better idea?"
dcpikwk,geeuurge,"It seems literally anything else would be better. I'm not going to argue merits of different governance systems because there's no data to compare, bar one. And while all the untried ones may or may not work, we know definitively that the one you've tried doesn't. At least not for the goals you outlined before. But I'm curious how you can say that you've yet to discover a better system in good faith when in modern times you haven't tried any others, and how you can claim it's effective at a large scale."
dcpvwxy,TheyAreAllTakennn,"America is still the most powerful country in the world and the quality of life here is still far better than almost any other country that has a government that isn't a democracy.Every other form of government in histroy has failed to provide a high quality of life for its citizens much harder and faster than democracy time and time again, that's why we resorted to democracy in the first place, and that's why so many others have done the same. We most certainly do have data to compare it to.We haven't discovered any other systems because we've already tried most if not all of them. You seem to be under the impression that we could just go, ""eh, this isn't working let's try something new again."" But no, there is nothing new that is likely to work. There are only so many forms of government. We can make variations of these forms of government, which we have done already in our own democracy, but to invent a completely new and functional form of government is not going to happen, there just aren't that many in existence.So, *again*, **tell me your better idea, and then we can talk.** If you can't do that and evade the question like you did above, then I'll dismiss you as ignorant or as a troll, and not respond."

Here is the issue, I do not consider myself a climate change denier because I am not even afforded the luxury of these facts to deny them in the first place. Apparently I am chasing ""rose-tinted visions of a past that never was"" because I have never read the whitehouse.gov page and do not take the x amount of scientists as seriously as I take the 3 in 4 dentists recommend this toothpaste.

They didn't vote for whoever won, so whatever happens it's not on them. They just sit around and complain about whichever side is in power. And then at the next election when they are given the choice to make another change they sit back and bitch about how all politicians are the same again, and let fear stop them from voting.Even if voting takes all day, so what? It's one day. Do the fun stuff you were going to do instead some other day. You get 729 days until the next election, I'm sure you'll find the time to do the fun things. It's not a rational choice. It's a fear driven one. If they don't want either fruit offered, vote for someone else. That's still a choice.

If there is, say, a super-intelligent species or a strain of light or a wave that can intentionally control and affect us, won't that be similar to what religions describe as the all-powerful God, somewhat?Basically, what I'm trying to say is that while the proof of presence of a literal God is non-existent, the possibility that something else in the strange and awe-inspiring universe may have god like powers cannot yet be disproved or proved by science yet. It is a waiting game. That's how I think about agnosticism. Then a whole another arena is spirituality."
dcoreik,pdabaker,"You're right. But most people who identify as atheists don't deny that. It's just the believe that there's no evidence for as such a thing and therefore no point in discussing it to begin with.

It's just the feeling of ""I'll believe it when I see it"".People who call themselves agnostics (online) tend try to act like atheists and Christians are both somehow equally ""closed minded"".

dcoo7qw,kosha,"Yeah, the Dems basically need to pull another Obama. Find a candidate with little to no baggage, relatively young, and full of ideas and you have an easy victory. It was immensely obvious that Hilary had no chance in this election, having more political experience is seen as a liability, not a benefit...just look at our last eight or so elections...the candidate with less political experience who was viewed as ""the outsider"" won."
dcoofdb,PraetorianFury,Obvious? She was polling ahead for the entire election season.
dcop9hf,kosha,"Polling isn't the same as voter sentiment, someone may intend to vote for a candidate and will answer as such on a survey but if they're not actually enthusiastic about the candidate then they may not have the motivation to actually show up to the polls and vote. Hilary ran on an assumption that Americans had a high level of economic satisfaction and essentially promised to keep everything the same as Obama. Depending on your socioeconomic status having someone maintain the status quo may be a good or a bad thing, but if you're poor and out of work you're probably going to gravitate toward the candidate who is promising at least some of ""change"". It's the same reason that casinos are mostly frequented by lower-income individuals, when you don't have much to lose you're a lot more willing to roll the dice.Trump's base had way more enthusiasm and excitement for their candidate, Hilary's voters mostly felt compelled to vote for her in order to stop Trump. Which motivation do you think is going to result in more people actually showing up to the polls?"
dcp0vhn,PraetorianFury,"What you're describing is the difference between polls and polls of ""likely voters"". This is something that is taken into consideration in most reputable polls.

dcpx5q6,kosha,"Enthusiasm alone won't win a primary, as Bernie shows you need numbers in addition to enthusiastic voters. Trump had a large number of enthusiastic voters, voters who are excited to vote are more ""likely"" to vote. Clearly the ""reputable"" polls which were mostly wrong didn't account for that correctly."
dcpxpu6,PraetorianFury,The polls showed a large dip immediately before the election. They weren't wrong. People changed their mind. Wonder why.

dcq5w4p,PraetorianFury,"The Florida poll shows Trump up by .2 points. So...great way to undermine your own point by not looking at your own source? Regardless, state polling is less reliable than nation-wide polling for a variety of reasons. There are occasional errors and lots of variation. To dismiss all of them because you think you know better is immensely arrogant.Hindsight is 20/20 and I'll give you that Bernie Sanders probably would have won the general if he'd won the primary. Not necessarily because he was the better candidate, but because of several of the Clinton campaign's optimistic assumptions that ended up being false, such as* Republicans would find Donald Trump so unpalatable that they would vote 3rd party or stay home. Instead, 91% of self-described Republicans voted for him.* Women would be eager for a woman president especially when faced with a candidate who bragged about sexual assault. Instead Republican women voted for Trump at the same rate as Republican men, around 91%.* Democratic fear of Trump combined with a strong get-out-the-vote operation would produce strong Democratic turnout. It was infact 7 points below Republicans, at 84%.[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-exit-polls-how-donald-trump-won-the-us-presidency/]Personally, I assumed that voters would find Bernie Sanders too radical and too closely associated with communism to vote for him. But we saw during this election that Republicans consider liberals more of an enemy than Russia.[http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/gop-russia-putin-support-232714] And given how stark the contrast was with Clinton and Trump, how filmsy the scandals for Clinton and how shocking/definitive the scandals for Trump, it seems clear to me that the truth doesn't matter. People hear what they want to hear. We've entered a new age of partisanship, and the only thing that matters is energizing the wings, as the center will always be terrified of the other side.A lot of experts were shocked by the outcome of the election. They're still analyzing it, but you seem to think that you knew better before it happened. I suppose if it was obvious to you after reading a few opinion pieces on salon or RCP that you've got a promising career ahead of you as a political strategist. Perhaps you can prevent a disaster like this in the future. Good luck."
dcq6ikw,kosha,"I'm not dismissing the polls nor suggesting that I have a way to make them better, but clearly the polls for multiple states did not accurately reflect the actual results so there is something wrong in how ""likely voters"" are counted. If the polls from right before the election were accurate then ""experts"" wouldn't be shocked by the results. I know next to nothing about political polling but I'm guessing that one of the factors used to survey people is how likely they are to actually vote, I'm guessing that the likelihood of a Trump supporter showing up to the polls was underestimated or the likelihood of a Trump supporter showing up to the polls was overestimated. I never said that Bernie would've had a better or worse chance against Trump, just that his base (though much smaller than Trump's) had similar enthusiasm. Again, the election result was hardly a surprise outcome given how the vastly different levels of enthusiasm between the two candidates. The underdog, with less political experience but more ability to speak and connect with voters, tends to do better in presidential elections...just look at Clinton v. Bush, Reagan v. Carter, Obama v. McCain, etc"

I will never vote for a politician that doesn't actually speak to the left. And by left, I mean workers' rights and economic social floor. I don't care about the progressive agenda outside of everyone should have exactly the same rights and redoing drug policy. I don't need a politician to wade neck deep into racial, social, and cultural bogs when the people whom it involves most won't do that. I want the 1st amendment reaffirmed both in reduction of grovelling to special interests as well as governmental overreach (i.e. Manning and Snowden) I want the 2nd amendment left alone (although I am in favor of mandatory safety training before someone can purchase a gun.) I want the 4th amendment significantly strengthened, particularly digital issues. If a candidate can't speak to a majority of those issue, then I'm more concerned with attempting to give the other parties a voice rather than bowing down to the dem establishment. I'd much rather keep taking 3 steps back until we can't step back any further and must move forward as a party than I am in constantly taking 1 step back in perpetuity like the dem establishment would have us do. For my lifetime, the politics of the party have been to only be marginally better for the middle class than the repubs. I'm sick of it. I think a lot of leftists like myself saw what the tea party did by blowing up the party from the inside and then taking a significant role in shaping policy moving forward. From the outside, we all laughed as the republican party seemed to be a comedy of errors. Meanwhile, all while you can't avoid media scrutiny for anything, they've taken over the government. And either through hubris, naivete, or ignorance, the democratic party got the country stolen from underneath them. School boards, regulatory boards, city/town councils, state govt, both houses of Congress and now the Presidency. None of that happens without the Tea Party. So I think the Bernie dems are going to follow that playbook going forward until the establishment can't take the losing anymore. If the Dems want to represent us, then we are going to make motherfucking sure they do. And if they don't want to play with us, then they can keep losing. It isn't like they're representing us anymore than the repubs.Edit: One last thing to add. Right now, neither the D or the R parties are giving me what I want. So the net effect to me is zero. You need me more than I need you because you aren't doing anything for me anyway. Keep that in mind when you begin to act like I'm the jerkoff.

You can attempt to marginalize me by putting me in the green party box but that isn't really the case or who I am. I also do not ideological purity on the left. I need a candidate that actually wants my life to get better. I want a candidate who isn't interested in shifting more wealth upwards while the middle class is withering.

Unfortunately for you and the establishment-types, there are lots more like me and we'll do it to the party again if we aren't heard.

dcpdhix,your_real_father,"And the DNC could have had all of those things left in tact (or dare I say even improved) if they hadn't stacked the deck for Hillary. I don't agree with the TPP at all. If you want to protect IP, sure. But I saw what nafta did. We traded a lot of really good jobs for slightly more part time Walmart-style jobs. No thanks. You act like it's my kind keeping these things from happening. It isn't. Bernie would have given you all of this. But the ultra wealthy taskmasters didn't want Bernie because he would have taxed them more. But when you support an institution like the dnc that rewards corruption, you are endorsing that. Don't be mad at me because I'm not going to reward corruption and ignoring the middle class. One or the other. Not both. Obama ignored the middle class but we looked past it because, as far as anyone knows, he's squeaky clean so we at least felt like we were getting close to fair shake, overall. JFK was wrapped up in all kinds of nonsense but it felt like he was for us (that was the perception anyway) so we let his unethical stuff slide.So from now on, I'm going to treat the DNC like a toxic parent. I don't want to cut them off completely, but if they want a relationship, it's going to be on my terms, not theirs. We saw a lot of leftists/progressives adopt this tone for the general this year and I think we're going to see more in the future. So if you truly care about left and social issues, you'll be all for this. If, for you, it's all about big business interests then you should probably switch to republican. As this election showed, you can't win without us. If you want grassroots enthusiasm, it comes from us. If you want feet on the street, it comes from us. Whether the establishment likes it or not, we are actually the base of the party. We've been pacified for decades because it was more important to win elections than it was to actually get what we wanted. I don't think we're pacified anymore.

The days of bipartisanship are over. The only bills that receive bipartisan support are ones that screw the middle class. Effective politicians don't make deals anymore, typically (Bernie being one of the outliers.) They obfuscate, obstruct, and bully.And if that's all the republican party gets but we can shape discourse for the next 50 years because of it, it's a small price to pay. That's how the Tea Party positioned itself and look at the politics of the GOP now - it's a TPers wet dream - and they won. If the progressive/left wing of the democratic party can pull off a similar feat, then as uncomfortable as this election was, it'll be worth it.

Unless citizens united were to get it's own reality tv show, America doesn't care so neither will the pols.Lastly, Obama had a legal remedy to put a justice in place. He chose not to. You want to blame me, but someone could have actually handled that issue that both of us voted for and didn't. The reason? It isn't a concern for the establishment of the dem party."
dcpf625,clone822,"Bernie set as a condition of his support that Clinton would stop supporting TPP and nominate a SCOTUS member willing to help overturn Citizens United. This is something she verbalized support of in the debates. This is the ONE THING we can probably believe her on because the CU ruling was literally about the legality of a hit piece the republicans ran on **her**. Voting Rights Act - they gutted section 5 in 2013 because they said the formula was obsolete. The republicans haven't (to nobody's surprise) made a new formula. A shitload of gerrymandering ensued, some of it happening right on the day of the ruling, in the states that the VRA previously affected. Just today, Alabama got hit with a ruling that they gerrymandered the election, which they will appeal of course. Your legal remedy had supreme court precedent against its legality. Obama probably knew that, being a constitutional law professor.> 13 Republicans joined Sanders and a majority of Democrats in supporting the amendment, while 13 Democrats and a majority of Republicans opposed it.Lets not pretend the democrats are why it failed. A majority of the votes in favor were democrat. You can't seriously tell me both sides are the same because of this bill when this bill CLEARLY illustrates a massive difference."
dcpfmo3,your_real_father,"> This is the ONE THING we can probably believe her on because the CU ruling was literally about the legality of a hit piece the republicans ran on her.I'll have to do more research regarding this. I don't recall any single recipient exploiting this as much as she had. As far as the TPP, I didn't believe her. Some small inconsequential tweaks would have been made. Her proxies would have pitched the ""new and improved"" tpp as so much better now that Hillary fixed it and it would have been the same thing.Here's the thing about gerrymandering that no one on reddit ever talks about: both parties' reps and senators love it and will do their best to not change it. CGP grey had a pretty good explanation about it. But basically there are a lot of dem seats that are untouchable as well and because they don't want to lose those seats to uncertainty any more than the repubs do and thus will keep the status quo."
dcpft3u,clone822,"http://election.princeton.edu/2012/12/30/gerrymanders-part-1-busting-the-both-sides-do-it-myth/Here is a pretty thorough explanation on why gerrymandering by republicans is much, much worse."
dcpfwbg,your_real_father,I'm not saying they aren't worse but if the guys who are supposed to be against it aren't what hope do we have of it actually being fixed? I can't get disgusted by them if my own party is a willing participant.
dcpfx5f,clone822,"A new VRA formula, for starters. No democrat can vote against that without being tarred and feathered."
dcpg5tj,your_real_father,"That's kind of my point, though. They don't want a light shone on gerrymandering and talking about that seems like it would shine a light on it. I don't think they're going to touch that issue. They're also going to misread (purposely so as to avoid introspection and accountability) Trump's win as America is racist so they'll want to avoid pissing off the now racist America by bringing this up. There are very few leaders in the dem party these days. Bernie, Warren, Franken, Reid when it's politically expedient. After that, it's mostly establishment hacks and empty suits who's only real goal is to keep their seats. They'll do and say whatever it takes to do that, period. If the gerrymandering issue, in any way were to get in the way of that, they avoid it (as they have.)"
dcpgltk,clone822,"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/obama-holder-redistricting-gerrymandering-229868Obama has made it his post-presidency cause, believing it to be the keystone issue of our democracy. It really would've been much better with a left leaning SCOTUS to hear the inevitable challenges and appeals, but here we are."
dcpj0k2,your_real_father,"When it actually happens I'll believe it. Obama has been a really strong person when it comes to his election and reelection but when it's come to defending against the wants of the 99%vs the establishment, he's been not so good. I hope he becomes the guy we saw on the campaign trail and not the guy who sat in the oval office. Having said that, I'll be pissed because he wasted 8 years in a position where he could have done much, much more than he could do in 8 lifetimes as a retired pres."
dcow4gw,your_real_father,"Yeah. I'm ok if people want to perceive it that way. I personally don't think that someone exercising their constitutional right to vote is disgusting but to each their own. Either way, I'll never vote another establishment person for pres again. I've earned the next 4 years as much as anyone has, but you don't get it. For me, my life wasn't going to improve under Hillary either. So I'd rather the system go fuck itself along with anyone that supports it. If the dnc didn't want Trump, they shouldn't have colluded to put Hillary as the nominee."
dcozhpu,clone822,"The DNC emails that show any sort of perceived collusion all date after May 3rd, at which point Sanders had mathematically lost."
dcp0kkw,your_real_father,"If you believe that, simply because an email doesn't exist, I have some prime Florida swampland to sell you. I thought it was crazy that they put that shit in email. In previous generations, that stuff definitely happened but it was done behind closed doors and never got any attention."
dcp14px,clone822,"Do you think they switched servers for coordinating their nefarious deeds in May just in case they got wikileaked in October? Nevermind, i'm sorry i started, go on believing whatever you want. There's really no point now. Whenever you see Trump on the news just keep on thinking ""Hillary woulda done that too."""

Or in your mind, they did the math on May 2nd and said to themselves ""hey guys and gals, we have Bernie whooped, so now let's all write some emails to show that we colluded (even though we didn't at all) against Bernie but only now that he's mathematically eliminated."" You can't possibly think that's what happened, right? Because that's exactly what you're implying happened through those two statements that I quoted above."
dcpdpl9,clone822,"Alternatively, she was the de-facto nominee and they wanted the primary to end so they can start the general. Which is what you'd expect people strategizinig the DEMOCRATIC PARTY CAMPAIGN to do."
dcpdysq,your_real_father,Then why collude against Bernie only from that point forward if she was pivoting to the general? That doesn't make any sense.
dcpe60k,clone822,"Because he had the far-left, all of it, and she needed them on her team ASAP. The democratic party really needed Bernie to do what Hillary did for Obama, which was concede and pass all her supporters over for the greater good.

dcpehtu,your_real_father,"I still don't think that makes any sense but I'll play ball on that premise for a sec.So instead of colluding with the media, offer the guy the VP slot. Oh wait, she couldn't because of a deal she had made years ago with Kaine and DWS.But I like how you think it's acceptable for her play to be to collude with the media to bully the guy into conceding after the way Hillary ran her campaign against Bernie (see David Brock.)If the DNC/Hillary were willing to lean on the media to bully Bernie into concession, 1. how is that acceptable 2. how did they not think it would cause resentment from the left 3. with having done it (provably,) why to you is it so unfathomable that they would have done it before that? I'm actually curious to hear your answers on these 3 questions."
dcpewzl,clone822,"1) Because he was trailing by 900 delegates and was dragging it out, because unlike Hillary he raised zero dollars for downticket races, because Donald won his primary by May 4th and the DNC really, really, REALLY needed to switch gears.2) Resent all you want, I did too. You think i was HAPPY about things? I voted for Bernie. But at the end of the day, the bitter pill is still medicine. 3) There's no proof of it being done before May, despite us having all their emails. In fact, that's kinda proof there wasn't any."
dcpf6g7,your_real_father,"1. He was dragging it out bc I think he was angling for vp and/or to pull the platform to the left. You didn't answer about the acceptability. You gave me their reasoning, not whether *you* think it's acceptable.2. Well we're swallowing a double bitter pill then. Like you said, it's medicine.3. One point to make is lack of proof can never be construed for lack of act. We don't have all of their emails either. We have some of Hillary's and Podesta's. There's more dirt to be found. That also doesn't answer why you find it so impossible for them to have done that before may 3rd. As far as money went, it seemed like Hillary shifted ran a ton of money through state parties and then used it for herself (in order to bypass personal limits if I'm not mistaken) without really giving any of the money to downtickets either. I would imagine this was a big reason why we lost the senate. Everybody is a politician on reddit. Let's talk like people and drop the party lines. I'm asking about your opinions.

It's time for the corporate dems to GTFO and stop holding progressives back.The fact that Sanders nearly beat clinton despite the DNC's fuckery should be sending clear messages to the dem elites.Their time is over.

dcp9erq,jagd_ucsc,"I'm sorry but I don't think losing by ~3 million votes in the primary counts as ""almost beating Clinton.""

This is what I feel and am open to alternative viewpoints on the matter. Any thoughts?"
dcot2ko,AnimusNoctis,Democrats and Republicans each have more in common with Libertarians than they do with each other. Democrats and Libertarians will both tell you that the Government should stay out of personal lives. Republicans and Libertarians will both tell you that the government shouldn't regulate the economy or provide services. The political spectrum is a square with liberals and conservatives in opposite corners and libertarians and authoritarians in the others.

It's just that, I see republicans on tv saying things that I find often times completely off base, I think to myself ""Are they serious? How can they not see what I see?"" Then I see democrats on tv and they also often times say things that seem like they just don't get it. I find both parties similar in that they often times look at things with what I consider a completely off base perspective. Example. During the presidential debates, I would sit and listen to Trump and Hillary, and on certain topics, and with certain questions, they would answer in ways the bothered me. There answers showed either dishonesty, ignorance/confusion, feigned ignorance/confusion, etc.. So many politicians from both sides rub me the wrong way, that's the similarities that I see. That's said, I do believe what I said in my first comment. But this is a more info on the similarities I find."

dcou7qq,Jedi_Ewok,"When people say theyre the same they mean their motivations. They all want to increase their power base and take it away from the people. They want more money for themselves, family, and business partners and few of them care anything about actual people. The only thing that differs is which voting block they pander to and how they go about attaining that power but even that is usually the same. Sometimes throughout all of it something beneficial actually gets done. Sometimes. I think there are far more similarities with W's presidency and Obama's than there are differences, especially in regards to foreign policy and ""security"" issues at home and abroad."
dcowl2c,bowies_dead,"I don't care about their motivations, I care about their policies."
dcphoos,Jedi_Ewok,"Why is just as important to understand and consider as what and how. I mean in a practical sense you just pick which side is voting the policies you most like, but it's important to know their motivations to help predict long term repercussions and know if you truly agree with those policies. For example, people bought in wholeheartedly to the Patriot Act because they thought it would protect them when it was just about expanding government powers and everyone in congress knew it. People heard the politicians saying their reason was to protect them but wouldn't spend 2 seconds looking for their true motivations. If they had they wouldn't have supported it so fervently. There are thousands of examples where knowing a politician's true motivations behind policy will affect your opinion of it. Now this doesn't necessarily apply so much to climate change specifically as that is really a scientific issue that has been unfortunately caught up in politics. The Republicans just use it as a way to divide the country and secure a voting block, in this case stupid people, so it's kind of different but it's true for most issues. In this case there is a right and a wrong, but that's not true for 99% of politics. TLDR: You should care about their motivations because it will give you broader insight into long term repercussions."
dcpt9qi,bowies_dead,The Patriot Act was bad policy. Your conjectures about motivations are irrelevant.
dcq3fqj,Jedi_Ewok,Yes the Patriot Act was a bad policy. My point is if people looked into the true motivations behind the policy they wouldn't have been so easily duped.

dcop946,Incendivus,"Just speculating, maybe it's meant to emphasize that this is *our* problem rather than *the planet's* problem?Something that affects ""the Earth"" is relatively abstract. It's almost so cosmic in scale that it's hard to pinpoint the effects on our lives.Maybe it's the same thing as the reason why a lot of people don't take ""brain damage"" seriously. Not everyone is readily able to make concrete for themselves the relationship between ""the brain"" and, like, *WHO YOU ARE*. I'd imagine it's the same for the planet as it is for the brain. It's almost such an integral thing to your existence that it's hard to look at it in a concrete, articulate fashion.I don't know, I'm just speculating. It seems like that might be a useful aspect of that saying, if you're trying to promote environmental awareness."
dcor7dz,subdep,"The difference between Venus and Earth is life.Without life, Earth is just a chunk of fucking rock and water floating through space.Run away global warming could kill off all life on the surface of Earth. At that point nothing about Earth would be special, most importantly, nobody would be alive to call it ""Earth"".So yes, Earth (not just a people) is quite possibly fucked."
dcoru2u,CaptainNoBoat,"I agree wholeheartedly. And it is a good sentiment to remind the misinformed that we are ultimately affected. I wouldn't have any problem with the phrase if not for people saying it every. single. time. It becomes an empty phrase the more I analyze it, and I'm being pretty nitpicky, I admit."
dcovgv9,Incendivus,"Yeah, I find the phrase overly snarky and pedantic too. Just trying to speculate about why people might find it useful. I wish we would start phrasing these issues in terms conservatives can relate to.

dcoog81,tarnok,"But it's really NOT about the earth. It's about us. It's disingenuous for us to make such a bold claim about saving the earth or the environment when what we are trying to save is our breif little biodome that can support homosapiens. Way over, way over 99% of all species that have existed are gone, and we'll be gone soon too if we don't take matters into our own hands. Even if we did nothing our planet will change gradually on its own and our little biosphere that we are comfortable in will be gone. A couple million years is just minutes to our planet.The point of the joke and the statement that people are attempting to make is to stop trying to sound it all high and mighty and basically face the facts and make it a selfish cause about saving humans - we'd probably be a lot more interested in controlling climate change if it's about us instead of the stupid fucking pandas.Edit: the thing is we are from the earth and from the cosmos, but we're also recycled. We really aren't that unique, we just like to think we are. To the perspective of a planet we aren't really that important not are we really that much of a threat to it. All the carbon we are burning was already in the air millions of years ago, it got buried by plants, now we dug it up. Big whoop to the earth."
dcop4u9,Tite_Reddit_Name,"I have the opposite view.It's not about us. I have absolute faith that humanity will survive even in some mad max apocalypse scenario. Sure lots of people will die but we've got the technological means to survive quite easily if it came down to it. The rest of Earth will NOT be around when we talk about the biosphere. The whole point is to save the plants and animals that are in danger of rapid climate change due to humans. ""Our brief little biodome that can support homosapiens"" cmon, we are talking about protecting forests, oceans, mountains, every other mammal, bird, reptile, fish, insect. I'm not being high and mighty when I say we should take responsibility and be compassionate here. The only selfish sentiment I have is that my kids and myself can enjoy these things in the future."
dcos9kb,tarnok,Interesting - how long do you think humanity will survive? On a timescale - a couple extra thousand years? Even just natural genetic mutations/evolution over a long enough timeline will have changed us into a different species.
dcrk6zx,Tite_Reddit_Name,"If we don't kill ourselves off through wars/conflict and assuming no global extinction events like meteor impacts before we colonize other planets/moons, I don't see us going anywhere for tens of thousands of years. Definitely will be a different species eventually, especially as we colonize off Earth. Seeing as we've been homosapiens for 200,000 years though, it will take a lot to really change us at that level."

So she brought upon and guided hundreds of millions of years of evolution until a creature capable of creating plastic for her emerged. And now that she has plastic, the relatively rapid process of removing the humans from the earth can begin. It's a darkly comic but thought-provoking bit."

dcoxz04,TheMealz,"Neither was a particularly good candidate. But Hillary's ""scandals"" were far overblown especially when compared to Trump. For instance, Hillary did not settle a massive fraud case involving stealing students money. That was Trump. I hear you on not rewarding shitty behavior, but is proving a point more important than stopping someone like Trump who has shown he has every intention of impeding progress in many aspects of society?

But what you fail to realize is we have a very flawed two party system. We have it. Third party voting is meaningless (really, it is. It gets nothing done specifically because our political system is flawed). So given the options of Trump and Hillary... I mean really I would like to think it's common sense. One candidate literally committed fraud in addition to bring a man child that makes me embarrassed to even read his tweets, has very evident conflicts of interest, and is likely putting on a show being the ""champion of the common people"". The other ""seems untrustworthy"". Gee I wonder what choice makes more sense."

The calthrate gun has yet to happen and if it does happen during Trump's term it will not be a direct result of him. It will be the last 50 years. I'm not even American. I thought Bernie was the best candidate. But all these idiots don't seem to understand that they fucked themselves. Given the choice between a openly racist sexist bigot greedy businessmen and a secretly corrupt left wing milking ""I might be proven to have a shit record but I'm a Clinton! and a woman, it's my turn!"" Whiner the American people were fucked from the beginning. And the rest of the planet along with them. Maybe this will put both groups into a ""maybe we should talk and find common ground"" mentality instead of only having 2 choices. Now all the idiotic middle class can get their heads out of their asses and realize this is a global issue. Corruption and warming. But maybe it will knock them off their high horse.

Lots of really educated people are leading that nation, though they do inevitably fuck up cause of greed. Their recent move for renewable energy is a step in the right direction, but it's probably a part of their campaign to increase living standards in the rural areas, which includes adding electricity and internet to remote areas.Still, even as a Chinese, I know better than to allow China the role of world leader. First thing they'd do is make sure no one else can ever take that away from them, and then start harassing people for all their money. There's a lot of anger still left in the nation after being invaded so many times... I can't help but wonder if they're still considering staging a few occupations and genocides of their own."

What is concerning is that Trump had built nothing in the form of a website in preparation for this day that was obviously coming, and then there's the deeply concerning rejection of science, and all progressive policy, that is being displayed instead."
dcoyb6h,mistrbrownstone,> What is concerning is that Trump had built nothing in the form of a website in preparation for this day that was obviously comingObviously coming... for less than three months.The Obama administration had years to prepare healthcare.gov and spent 2 billion dollars doing it.That website was a hell of a lot more important to a lot more people than a White House information page and it was basically unusable for months.
dcp44s4,Esc_ape_artist,"What does creating an entire setup handle millions of hits, registration, and whatever the heck goes into massive effort like that have to do with creating a few web pages stating policy objectives and perhaps a mailing list/social media options on it?

dcoswoq,ChiefTommyHawk,"Correct me if I am wrong, but hasn't every president when they have gone out of office removes everything from the website to the archives? This seems like making a big deal over something that would have happened regardless of who became president. The president has to come up with their platforms and then put them on the website. Correct me if I am wrong though"

dcotn5r,ChiefTommyHawk,"I mean I completely understand their concern and respect their right to complain. When Trump's Supreme Court pick wants to jail gays for having sex it's hard not to say that is bullshit, especially when personally knowing people who are LGBTQ.Edit: this is totally off topic of what you were commenting on though I think, blame that on screwdrivers I've been drinking since it is my day off and I am personally not to excited about a trump presidency."

It's a fitting metaphor I think. Less than 2 hours in and revisionism and censorship are hard at work. All the people who think Trump is an idiot need to get that notion out of their mind right now, for good. He plays the idiot, because the role gets him what he wants.For the next 4 years every time something flashy is going on you need to look for what the other hand, the hidden hand is doing.

You realize the point of my post was that we will be extinct due to Global Warming and massive irreparable environmental damages such as the extinction of bees, coral reefs being destroyed, and general ecosystems not being cared for.

dcoo83y,RayWencube,"The problem isn't that the pages were deleted; it's that they weren't replaced. We no longer have a page on the President's website that explains how he will protect LGBT rights, or protect civil rights, or fight climate change."
dcou1k0,bikerwalla,"Just like Obamacare, the repeal must be followed immediately by the replace, or else people are going to die."
dcoohlu,AngryMob55,OMG not even 1 day into his administration and he doesn't have the entire website updated/transitioned! WE'RE ALL DOOMED! ffs...
dcooy3t,RayWencube,That isn't how it works. This website has been ready to go for a while. They swap them out at noon. They don't slowly make changes as the website is live.
dcopnej,AngryMob55,"Oh I'm sure most of the pages have been ready to go, of course. But expecting every specific page to be ready is nonsense. Especially since the Obama team is making such an extensive website of their own. There is likely way too much going on behind the scenes for a smooth transition to occur as a ""swap."" Since when are government websites expected to be ran so smoothly and perfectly?"
dcopp10,RayWencube,"> Since when are government websites expected to be ran so smoothly and perfectly?Got me there, dog"
dcoqef7,BanzaiTree,"Trump & the GOP have already made it very clear they don't believe in climate change and have no intention of addressing it. But yeah, hide behind your ""give them time to update the website"" bullshit."
dcoqa9r,KingGorilla,Far before day 1 his cabinet picks were shitty. That's when I realized we're doomed.
dconpe3,RexHavoc879,"The concern is what is [not] in the official pages that represent the positions of the current administration. It's not ""oh no, Obama's pages were deleted,"" but rather ""oh no, Trump doesn't care about these important issues"""
dcosbsk,MyL1ttlePwnys,"The problem is that people are acting like deleting is the same as actively coming out against it. There is legitimate concern on Climate, as his official .gov stance is denial. On the LGBT issue, he doesnt even address it, meaning he isnt likely to take a stance on anything other than leaving things the way they are."
dcotqny,RexHavoc879,">leaving things the way they areis a big problem for a lot of people. LGBT folks can be fired from their jobs or denied housing in many states due solely to their sexual orientation. Even though LGBT people make up less than 5% of the population, 40% of homeless people under age 24 are LGBT people that were kicked out of their houses and ostracized by their communities because they are LGBT. Suicide rates are much higher in the LGBT population, especially trans people, because of bullying. Same sex marriage was a huge win for LGBT rights, but a lot of other very serious problems remain. Even more so if Trump signs into law the first amendment defense act, as he promised to do, which would expressly legalize people's right to discriminate against gay people (such as by refusing to recognize their marriage or refusing to provide medical treatment) and make it *illegal* for the federal or state government to take any action against the homophobe. Oh, and his top pick for the Supreme Court thinks that homosexuality should be criminalized."
dcop88t,dawgthatsme,Well the new energy page specifically states that he will repeal the Climate Action Plan sooo
dcorcg5,lookatmeimwhite,"It also says> Our need for energy must go hand-in-hand with responsible stewardship of the environment. Protecting clean air and clean water, conserving our natural habitats, and preserving our natural reserves and resources will remain a high priority. President Trump will refocus the EPA on its essential mission of protecting our air and water."
dcornip,brianpv,They're just going to say that CO2 isn't/cannot be pollution and ignore it.
dcsxhi0,lookatmeimwhite,"Well, ideally they won't say that about lead so someone will actually do something about the [thousands of other locations in the US with water worse than Flint](http://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-lead-testing/) and Flint, MI itself. Nothing has been done yet to address Flint's issues. Meanwhile, [Trump has been the only candidate to say he will take action](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/11/02/donald-trump-has-a-zany-plan-to-fix-flints-water-for-free/?utm_term=.4327b4bac889). Time will tell whether or not he will follow through.Whether or not it's actually free to the tax payers (to me) is irrelevant. Those people need help and someone needs to take a stand for them."

dcos9em,brianpv,"I suppose there's a chance, but that's not generally how it works. They work on the new site offline, get it ready, and then replace it all with the touch of a button at 11:59 of Inauguration Day. They've had months to get the site ready, not hours."

dcovsd4,astro_eng,Renewables wont get us there in the near term stating otherwise is disingenuous.
dcowjbo,,"Because you say so is fact? I'm involved in a community that promotes action on climate change. Here's the carbon fee and dividend plan. https://citizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-fee-and-dividend/Coal is quickly becoming more expensive due to carbon catching (looking at roughly $170 a megawatt per hour), and solar went from $500 a megawatt per hour to $200 in just 6 years. And like with all technologies, the research gets better as well as the product. What evidence do you have to back your claims up? In a very short time it WILL be cheaper to use renewables. http://www.globalethicsnetwork.org/profiles/blogs/comparing-cost-fossil-fuels-v-s-renewable-energyhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-06/wind-and-solar-are-crushing-fossil-fuelsNot to mention this topic is a matter of urgency as well.Edit: The best analogy I can come up with is it's like trying to force America to use Blockbuster when everybody knows Netflix/Amazon/HBO is the future of entertainment"

Concern over an adjustment period that wouldn't last even 10 years? Probably not even 5 for that matter. Again we're talking a difference of $30 a megawatt per hour right now, today.

dcov55s,vesomortex,No because it's only confirmation on what we already knew. The more awareness we create regarding Trump's scientific illiteracy the better chance we have of mitigating the damage he's about to do.
dcorz7q,,"the article is a non-story, you will jump at anything"
dcou6xm,vesomortex,Trump said himself that climate change is a hoax. He has policies which include repealing climate change legislation. He also has policies which will worsen climate change. And you think the article is a non-story? And you think this is why I think he's a climate change denialist?
dcoym37,,"Its a non-story because the website is updating. Thats all. Sorry to burst your bubble.If you wanna debate his policies find an article about that, I'm sure there will be 10-75 of them on r/politics right now for you babies to cry over, go nuts."
dcp0l51,vesomortex,No. It's a story because it only reinforces his nutty ideas and policies.
dcp1wuu,,lol whatever fits your narrative
dcp69de,vesomortex,It's not a narrative. He literally said climate change was a hoax.
dcp7epj,,"Its a bullshit article just shut the fuck up, comment on something else."
dcrgmfp,vesomortex,No. I can comment on whatever I want to. Why do Trump supporters think it's ok to bully people around and to tell them what they can or cannot say...
dcrpj25,,"lol keep fighting the noble fight against the nazis, you're a hero"
dcrritm,vesomortex,"Learn to capitalize first words of sentences, first."
dcrsw5r,,ah really? didnt know that. hitting me where it hurts lol
dcoosus,PopeScribbles,Let's hope it's only four huh?
dcoo1yo,kiarra33,Denial?
dcopkuz,vesomortex,Yes. His campaign denied climate change.
dcopmrm,kiarra33,Not on the website though
dcov7e8,vesomortex,"His website has nothing about it, calls the Climate Act bad, and his policy is rife with climate denial, but it's ok because the website isn't directly denying climate change."
dcoovz4,LumpyWumpus,I love how I have to sort by controversial to find this stuff. People want so badly for their feeling to be reality that they actively reject the truth. It's amazing.
dcomzvq,,I used basic critical thinking skills to arrive to this conclusion myself.Pretty significant transition -- old pages archived and new blank slates installed for the new team to upload their own.Common sense wins out if you let it.
dcolwln,squirll31,Yes! This!
dcooku3,PureEvil666,"What people are complaining about is there is no information on climate change on the new administrations website. It's being ignored, when it shouldn't be."
dcoser7,HotMessMan,"No one is saying it's censorship lol. The are saying, it's obvious all these things have no equivalent on Trump's new site because they are issues that don't concern him/he doesn't think are issues. That is alarming, though not necessarily unknown."
dcou3ve,thereasonableman_,It's important that they archived it and he put up his new energy page and doesn't have a climate change. Semantics doesn't change the main point.
dcougxr,Chrispy_Bites,"No one's accusing anyone of censorship. Most of us know how sites like this are maintained. The issue isn't that Obama's White House site has been replaced. It's that the incoming administration---as illustrated by both the new whitehouse.gov policy statements *and* by, you know, the incoming president's own statements---doesn't believe in climate change."
dcolv4h,Jaerin,Give the new administration a chance to put up their webpages. I find it hardly note-worthy that pages that reference the previous administration in both words and pictures have been taken down. The whole government is in transition and to think that the new administration would have a brand new website with all their fully documented pages on day one is naive. There aren't any pages about guns either:https://i.imgur.com/inpwjQT.png
dconl2q,WeAllWillDie,That's what the transition period is exactly for. They have months to prepare the new site for the new administration then make that update.
dcou0kf,Androne,"https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy what part of this page screams ""we believe in climate change"""
dcp8lhb,Jaerin,"I made no suggestion on what the content would be, but taking down the old pages isn't some indication of automatic disagreement. They simply transitioned like everything else. Not everything has a political message to it."
dcp8phb,Androne,So after reading that you think there is another revision that might say they are pro doing something about climate change or just pollution in general? I think America First Energy plan speaks pretty clearly where they stand. Have a read its pretty short but to the point.
dcp8zvu,Jaerin,Where did I suggest that they did or didn't have a point of view on any subject? You're trying to have an argument about a non-political comment.
dconx5i,mozsey,"Oh man. It's almost as if they should have been doing this for a while. Like, with a team that helps transition into the White House."
dcoqm4g,TrumpSandersHRC,Do you have any idea how long it took Obama to get their webpage setup?
dcor772,MAGABMORE,"Nevermind the disaster that was the Obamacare webpage. Vastly overbudget, behind schedule, unsecure, and didn't work!"
dcp8j9l,Jaerin,"I have no idea how they do it to be honest. I deal with IT crap all day long and I have no clue how the government can transition as quickly as they do, but that still doesn't change the fact that taking down the old pages is some kind of message."
dcp9a7i,SPEZ_THE_BITCH,So why don't you ask Obama's administration what their message is in taking down the old pages?
dcpr60z,Jaerin,"I don't need to ask, it's ""I'm out of a job"""
dcokgbj,OMGSPACERUSSIA,">The Trump Administration is also committed to clean coal technology, and to reviving America's coal industry, which has been hurting for too long. COAL IS DEAD AND NECROMANCY IS A SIN.Why do you hate Jesus, Mr. Trump?"
dcoo5hv,Hackerboy603,"Hang on, weren't **they** the ones that said there was an ""ongoing debate"" about Climate Change? I don't think that implies the debate is between the Backspace key and the rest of the keyboard..."
dcoofil,,"This. As much as they've been crying about ""having a discussion"" and ""not jumping to conclusions,"" the right seems to want to delete all mention of the phrase and pretend it was never brought up in the first place."
dcoo6od,mburke1124,"While I don't think Trump will be great for the environment, I think it was taken down because most of the White House pages are messages from Obama. Trump is now the President so it makes sense to remove them until they can be updated. I'm certainly not excited about the next four years but I'm also not going to panic."
dcov76w,FutureNactiveAccount,Just give the man a chance ;) Hopefully we can meet back here in 4 years and discuss how it went!
dcoqcyj,Reek11,This was done by Obama... not Trump. It was down far before he was sworn in.
dcoqeyo,UnpopularOp1nion,"You realize that it was the old Obama administration that took down ***his*** own website, resulting in the ""removal"" of climate change. That's how things work. It's not as if Trump went in to the site and deleted everything about climate change, it's simply the shift from one administrations website to another.But please, continue the unbiased, equal representation of both parties that this subreddit totally represents. I love how a subreddit called simply ""politics"" doesn't report simply from the viewpoint of one group, its refreshing."
dcoqr5d,Strat-Frooshman,It's concerning how many people took this headline and ran with it without doing any research whatsoever on why it was actually removed. r/politics' name is a complete misrepresentation of what the sub is actually about.
dcornoq,UnpopularOp1nion,"Whatever political party you belong to, everyone should be searching for the truth. Do some research, know the facts, ***then*** come to a conclusion."
dcoss4v,bwitty92,"This is exactly how people made a killing by producing fake news leading up to the election. When people read something they want to be true, they accept it as truth without asking questions."
dcoqryb,bwitty92,Don't you dare bring logical explanations to events during a time like this!
dcoqgsg,,Fuck fuck fuck. FUCK.How much life will suffer as a result of human greed. Countless life forms who feel PAIN and suffering like us will suffer as a result of us. We alone held the mantle for protecting our fellow life forms. We will suffer. Earth is a web and we will soon know how dependent on the simple freshwater clam or pollinator we were.
dcoqsc6,LackingAGoodName,"Oh c'mon, this happens every time, you realize that right?"
dcor6sk,Ronki53,Most of the people on here were 9 years old when Obama was elected. they have no idea what is happening.
dcos4bk,LackingAGoodName,Very annoying :/
dcoqufm,42aaac71fb3f45cc60,"What exactly is the issue? Under Obama, there was a a few pages devoted to his major policy issues. One such page was relating to climate change.The site was updated with a few pages devoted to Trump's major policy issues. Trump isn't going to make climate change a major policy issue out of the gate."
dcon1g8,GilbertHamilton,"""To reiterate: It is normal that the site is completely new; it is notable that climate change is not mentioned on any one of Trump's new pages.""Should read ""it is notable that we are unable to realize the site is likely still being built and can't come to grips with the fact that it's different because we don't understand how the internet works."" Anyone who thinks that they would have an entire site ready to go and all prior links working clearly hasn't done any corporate level web-design."
dcon4l9,,[deleted]
dcon7xc,GilbertHamilton,I'm saying the lowest bidding firm that is contracted to transition a website probably did a shitty job at redirecting links.
dcop9k9,1LT_Obvious,"So you think the climate change page is there, just simply hidden because there are no links to it? Have you taken courses in web design before?"
dcothsy,Androne,He also didn't bother looking at the parts of the site that matter regarding climate change like their America first energy policy . It's pretty clear just reading that what the government's stance is on climate .
dcopjrx,GilbertHamilton,"No, I think it was never migrated because it was forgotten about not some conspiracy type ""lets make it warmer in here"" of thing.Source: I'm a software dev.To add: someone probably said, ""Lets start fresh with this new page, we need a lot more red for obvious reasons."" Then they added, ""While we're at it, lets migrate hosts to a new version of RHEL because reasons."" Then they went to update to the latest apache version and ended up needing some bastard various of TLS and GCC and said, ""fuck it,"" when they started pulling files over to the new location.Because nobody does this shit in baby-steps anyway, like they should. Like all of us software guys pretend to do.I'm going back to my server migration where I'm moving a few dozen scripts I didn't write, and changing the home directory on the new server at the same time."
dcoq5cb,BanzaiTree,Trump thinks climate change is a hoax & has no intention of addressing it.
dcoq70c,GilbertHamilton,This is also true.
dcoqkdy,BanzaiTree,"So the point of it being scrubbed from the website is true, because it is absent from the new White House website."
dcopov4,1LT_Obvious,"If that were true, wouldn't there be broken links leading to missing files? If it were supposed to be there, wouldn't there be evidence within the accessible parts of the site?"
dcops7f,GilbertHamilton,"> If that were true, wouldn't there be broken links leading to missing files?Not necessarily, no."

dcounc1,GilbertHamilton,"I'm just trying to say don't jump to a stupid website being a multi-level conspiracy when it could easily be explained away by decades of typical web/app ""project management"" lifecycles."
dcovrce,cmbg78,"Multi-level conspiracy? Here you go: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/01/20/trump-s-whitehouse-gov-disappears-civil-rights-climate-change-lgbt-rights.htmlThere is no conspiracy, it was planned, and the content replacing the original content (which is still apparently being deployed) is very different from the original. There is zero conspiracy, it's being updated.Had the original pages been restored, which would have been stupidly easy to do in a variety of ways, and you were correct, I'd expect to see the original content.So yeah, it's not a botched deployment. Nobody accidentally hosed a regex in a deployment script that failed to match LGBT/climate change/whatever. I'm just saying stop trying to defend what is clearly a planned content change by blowing it off as a deployment error. You aren't the only technologist on Reddit."
dcp64bw,GilbertHamilton,"I'm not defending a botched deployment idea any more than I'm defending the idea that it wasn't a conspiracy. It's just a different site. Yes, it's likely rife with corporate project management (see also: any relevant xkcd) but it wasn't a conspiracy in the way the article made if out to be. All sarcastic corporate deployment jokes aside, I mean to apologize if I muddied my thought."
dcorg8j,SaitoHawkeye,They managed to get language up about ending criticism of the police.
dcos2ly,GilbertHamilton,"Little known fact, that's a rake boilerplate site profile."
dcos5ze,SaitoHawkeye,> rake boilerplate siteWhat?
dcp6ruk,saganistkrieg,What indeed
dcotewp,Androne,So explain how they are supposed to fight climate change with their clean coal revival ?
dcopmru,,"Oh yeah. They're still working on it. That's why they mentioned this:>President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule.Yet made no mention of *actual* progress on climate change.What do you even believe? Do you really believe that Trump and the GOP support climate change? Or are you just trying to convince people that they do, when anyone with half a brain knows they don't? If the latter, *why*?"
dcoptzv,GilbertHamilton,"Please don't forget *change* can go in the other way, too. They're probably working on a wordpress template to make the thing look like the Shell and BP website."
dcooo7t,RayWencube,"So if we come back in three days and there are still no references to climate change, will you agree to donate $10 to the WWF? If there are, I'll donate $10 to...I guess whatever charity you'd like me to donate to."
dcop0vu,GilbertHamilton,The WWF wouldn't let me donate 10 online and that's about the max I can do these days. :/
dcooul7,GilbertHamilton,"Or we could just both donate anyway - because it's worth donating to. Hell, we could both donate in Trump's name. https://fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/461338259.jpg?w=840&h=485&crop=1"
dcop4eh,RayWencube,I like your style. And I can spot you a $10 donation to the WWF--I'll give $20 because I am ~~RICH~~ irresponsible with the little money I have.

dcotchw,Androne,"Considering their energy policy I think there is enough there to make a judgement on their stance on climate change. You should read it and make your own judgement though but nothing in there screams ""we are taking this issue seriously"" .

dcoqbi1,Varean,"Oh, you are trying to be deceiving aren't you. Trumps team had months to both design the site and fill it with additional policies. The easiest shortcut would be to fill it with policies from his campaign site. These shortcuts would allow the designer(s) to get approval from Trump before hand. And there is no reason you couldn't change it afterwards, so you can leave items that are already there as long as they don't conflict with your current policies. Trump wouldn't want people getting the wrong idea about him supporting the climate change truth."

dcop3md,Axumata,Woe to the defeated.

dcoqxen,lookatmeimwhite,"Quoted from the White House page:>our need for energy must go hand-in-hand with responsible stewardship of the environment.

dcsxqvy,thatpaxguy,"You're absolutely right, and here's the thing: they aren't proposing to provide better protection for the environment. They want to repeal those laws simply because they are ""burdensome"" to businesses. They're not proposing a replacement.So if you are concerned where the Clean Water Rule has failed, you should be especially concerned without ANY protective measures whatsoever."
dcsydmd,lookatmeimwhite,"He just became president on Friday. You need to give more than a weekend for a replacement to come forth.

dcszs3s,thatpaxguy,"If protecting clean air and water was a priority, the administration wouldn't be pushing for ""clean coal"" and claiming climate change is a hoax. You are lying to yourself if you think that same administration is going to improve on laws that they consider to be a threat to profit. Enough of that ""let's wait and see"" bullshit. His cabinet appointments and stance on these issues make it very clear."

dct1koc,thatpaxguy,"So you're telling me that the least qualified cabinet in history, with Scott Pruitt heading the EPA (as he's currently suing them) and also denying man's influence in climate change, is comparable? Wheeler was influenced by Obama's stance on net neutrality and did a 180° on his initial proposals, where every one of Trump's appointments adhere to his same set of policies. Wondering what your point is?"
dct582r,lookatmeimwhite,"> the least qualified cabinet in historyStop hyperbolizing.How can you prove Wheeler was influenced by Obama's stance on net neutrality?

The warming episode we're experiencing is at an unprecedented rate in comparison to all other naturally occurring warming episodes, and there's VERY strong evidence to suggest that it is due to human activity."
dcor5v4,lookatmeimwhite,"Except literally every other planet in our solar system is getting hotter right now, just like earth. We're thousands of years overdue for the hot shift."
dcovzpv,danukenator,Is the reason Earth is getting warmer the same as the other planets (if true)?
dcp491z,esreveReverse,"Geologist here. No. The earth goes through warming and cooling period due to global affects that are contained to our planet. All planets with water and atmospheres are going to have various changes in their climate over time.The earth is certainly getting warmer right now, and it's 99.99% certain that humans are contributing to it in a large manner. How bad the results could be, and if there's anything we can really even do about it, are what's up for debate.Did you know there have been millions of years on Earth where the planet was much warmer than it is today? The poles used to be tropical."
dcpb192,danukenator,"I was kinda' hoping to get his source or at least thought process. I study forest environments so climate change is an integral part of any monitoring/predictive modeling.Of all the wacky climate change claims I've heard, this one is a new one. Any idea of the origins?"
dcpeg7f,esreveReverse,Probably just trying to make you think that the entire solar system is heating up together.
dcp1d7h,Darth_Tanion,Do you have a source on that? I would be genuinely interested to read/watch it.
dcp3kj0,Oreganoian,This has been disproven. https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-other-planets-solar-system-intermediate.htm>There are three fundamental flaws in the 'other planets are warming' argument. Not all planets in the solar system are warming. The sun has shown no long term trend since 1950 and in fact has shown a slight cooling trend in recent decades. There are explanations for why other planets are warming.
dcswbaz,lookatmeimwhite,"It has absolutely not been disproven. If anything, the source you provided shows that.Here is the first two sentences from Gierasch, regarding Jupiter:> ""The energy source driving Jupiter's active meteorology is not understood. There are two main candidates: a poorly understood internal heat source and sunlight.""The source you posted has this to say about Pluto:> Pluto's warming is not clearly understood.Someone in the comment section had a good point, as well:> You realize that the argument, Jupiter is heated from within and only receives a small fraction of the energy from the sun that the Earth does, depends upon that 4% of energy being incapable of driving weather. We know this to be false from your own report regarding Neptune.While Jupiter receives 25 times less energy per square meter from the sun that the Earth does, Neptune receives 900 times less.> How is it that the 900 times weaker sunshine can drive weather and promote seasonal changes on Neptune, as you testify on this very blog above, but the much stronger incident sunshine on the face of Jupiter is considered inconsequential?> The fact is Jupiter is a strong case for solar driven climate change. The Great Red Spot is a singular weather event without a peer or analog on any of the other known worlds. Some people insist on describing it as a hurricane. This is incorrect. A hurricane is a low pressure zone funneling surrounding warm air to the ground. The Great Red Spot is a high pressure zone, forcing hot air out of the middle of the planet. It rises 8 kilometers above the surrounding methane cloud deck, like a turkey timer that is popping out to tell us that the thanksgiving meal is ready.And now we have another great red spot, which will probably be with us for a very very long time.>Neptune is changing in a spectacular and miraculous way which a cut and dried pdf file will not impart to you.>[Have a look at it in color](http://hubblesite.org/image/1354/news_release/2003-17). Neptune's orbit is 164 years long, and Voyager only visited it once back in 1989, so we have no baseline to judge if this change is the natural effect of Neptune traveling through it's orbit, or if it is the result of an augmented solar effect.> But either way it is the sun driving Neptune's weather.> Voyager was launched in 1977 and didn't get to Neptune until 1989. Right now, thirty years later, Voyager still has ten more years of travel before it reachs the heliopause, where the solar wind gives way to the pressure of interstellar space. So don't let this joker fool you that the sun is too weak or feeble to affect JupiterFinally, let's look at Uranus.> Uranus has just passed into the equinox of its orbit where the whole of the planet is receiving sunshine evenly, as opposed to just the one pole getting continuous sunlight. So of course it is going to cool down on the poles."
dcsxa9q,Oreganoian,"There's a lot of discussion about it in the comments in the link. It's not entirely understood. Using it to discredit earth climate change is not valid though, so it has been disproven in that regard."
dcsy86y,lookatmeimwhite,"So, it hasn't been disproven is what you meant to say.The sun's magnetic field has increased by 230 percent within the last 100 years. The energetic changes in the sun radiate outward though solar wind, thereby increasing the charge of interstellar space.As the sun's magnetic field grows, it attracts more dust. Consequently, the amount of star dust in the solar system has increased three fold since 2003, which is heating up interstellar space.Scientists believe the sun's polarity may have not completely reversed in 2001. Instead of reversing, from north to south, the poles may have flipped only half-way and now reside along the sun's equator. This weaker configuration of the sun's magnetic field has allowed two to three times more star dust to enter the solar system than in the late 1990sModern climate science (as far as I know) does not take this into effect.EDIT: I didn't include the [source](http://www.space.news/2015-10-06-entire-solar-system-is-heating-up-scientists-blame-solar-warming.html) for the paragraphs I ripped off."

dculsbl,lookatmeimwhite,"> There's also a recent [study from Denmark](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/12/E1406.abstract) stating climate change is actually cyclical fluctuations in the Earth's orbit around the sun, called Milankovitch cycles, that have been causing periods of dramatic, short-term global warming for at least 1.4 billion years.Have fun"
dcumb9o,ThrowawayTrumpsTiny,"There is literally nothing in here that disputes ACGW.The ""warming cycle"" that they and you described as ""short term"" is currently 11,000 years long and still running. There is absolutely nothing in there that describes a warming cycle anywhere near the rate of warming we have seen in anywhere near as a short a time as several decades.Which is exactly the point the comic that I posted makes. It's not that climate is changing, it's the rate of change. Which this paper does nothing to address."
dcumf0s,lookatmeimwhite,"...Which the other article in my post spoke about the rate of change.Look, I'm not doing this with you if you're not even going to read my post before you start being condescending."
dcun8cv,ThrowawayTrumpsTiny,"Meh, you've been condescending from the start.And then you should have linked that article. You linked one, I read it, it's not relevant because the time scales are too large to be applicable to the recent rate of change. If you have another, post it and I'll happily read it."
dcunbyz,ThrowawayTrumpsTiny,"Also- my post was in no way condescending. Your sensitivity is laughable- you called me dipshit and something else (I forget, cause who cares?) and I wrote zilch about you- just argued your points.Toughen up or don't debate on the Internet. Or, I guess, continue to attack and then complain about being attacked?"
dcunt73,lookatmeimwhite,"You didn't read my post and then said it's the rate of change that matters, which was specifically addressed in my post. I'm not sure why you would even want to have a discussion if you weren't going to read what you had asked for. I called you a dipshit because you linked a comic as if it was scientific fact.> The sun's magnetic field has increased by 230 percent within the last 100 years. The energetic changes in the sun radiate outward though solar wind, thereby increasing the charge of interstellar space.> As the sun's magnetic field grows, it attracts more dust. Consequently, the amount of star dust in the solar system has increased three fold since 2003, which is heating up interstellar space.> Scientists believe the sun's polarity may have not completely reversed in 2001. Instead of reversing, from north to south, the poles may have flipped only half-way and now reside along the sun's equator. This weaker configuration of the sun's magnetic field has allowed two to three times more star dust to enter the solar system than in the late 1990s.That is a recent rate of change, that has become more measurable over the last 20-30 years as the rate of change increased, but began nearly 100 years ago."
dcoqnhv,2_of_5pades,"Bahahahahah, you're so misguided it's actually hilarious, yet sad that there are people like yourself on this planet. We have evidence of man-made climate change, whether or not you want to accept it, but keep living in your little Trump-flake bubble."

dcowvol,L0ngdukd0ngR,"Dying on a hill while ignoring the overwhelming majority of scientists is kinda dumb, don't you think? Here's a graphic simple enough to understand.https://xkcd.com/1732/"
dcoy20t,tekkers_for_debrz,i suggest you read up on ice cores and do a little more research on climate change. A good way to start is by watching veritasium's video on climate change.
dcoz7lg,DejaEntendu203,"He said ""inherently""- this guy must know his shit. Everybody listen up."
dcozu21,selfsearched,"Does that mean atoms aren't real because there's no way to see them? Scientific method isn't limited to direct replication of the testing environment, it's about finding links through experiments and reasoning that can be recreated. Now I know none of that matters because you're a conspiracy theorist, but by your reasoning, gravity can't exist either because we can't recreate, touch, see, feel, taste, or hear it."
dcp146e,,[deleted]
dcp4lgp,ThrowawayTrumpsTiny,Nope. All wrong.https://xkcd.com/1732/
dcp4mjx,ashweiuohsdkjl,Cartoons as a source 🙄
dcp4xy0,ThrowawayTrumpsTiny,"And so concise and rich with data that they are entirely accurate, and anyone can understand them.But please, explain to me how an ad hominem attack on the medium actually refutes the conclusion.Ah, that's right, it doesn't. 🙄"
dcp5g6k,ashweiuohsdkjl,"No links to source data on your comic page. Also, the comic assumes the data source is correct for those periods, even though there were no humans around to record the data. And no, geological data/sediments/whatever doesn't supply strong evidence of temperatures. It's all projection - a best guess, an estimate - since there were no humans around to record the temperatures directly.That's the problem with today's climate ""science."" It's all based on projections, guesses, estimates, extrapolations, and heavily biased computer models by phony ""scientists."""
dcpsivr,ThrowawayTrumpsTiny,"Meh, usual counter argument- science is ""phony"" when I don't like it, and I don't have any counter evidence. Just the ability to call everyone else's evidence phony.I'm done, you're a believer, not a scientist, no point debating."
dcpufnm,ashweiuohsdkjl,"Explain why I should believe a bunch of people making estimates by digging up rocks and typing their favorite numbers into computers?Those are the two least useful and least verifiable ""sciences,"" because they involve immense amounts of peddling estimations, guesses, and theoretical formulas, and very little real experimentation with verifiable data. When you rely entirely on models and projections, as geology and climate ""scientists"" do, you get a different result from your model every time you change your base constants, or change the assumed (unverifiable) formula you made up.There is an infinite number of lines which fit through observed present day data. A computer modeler can pick their favorite to get their desired projections in the past or future.And none of their estimates can be verified by real science, because they are projections into the distant past or distant future, where real data is always out of reach.Why should I believe you? Because you gathered real time, repeatable, observable, unbiased data from real world variables? Of course not. I should believe you because ""My model projected it to be true."" Great, then I'll go rig up a model that says the exact opposite, and we can all go home happy."
dcq0o44,ThrowawayTrumpsTiny,"Nope.All of your comments are meaningless here, because they could be applied to every scientific theory in any field. And yet- we have theories that work, and successfully predict outcomes.Anthropogenic catastrophic global warming/ climate change theories successfully predict outcomes.Others don't."
dcq1l61,ashweiuohsdkjl,">All of your comments are meaningless here, because they could be applied to every scientific theory in any field. And yet- we have theories that work, and successfully predict outcomes.Theories which are verified by real, observable data in the present, sure. But the BS theories in climate change and geology are unverifiable, because they make predictions about the past or future on the order of years, decades, centuries, or longer. They take a tiny slice of data (100 years of reliably recorded/written temperatures, generously), and extrapolate it to ""estimate"" data from thousands of years in the past, or thousands of years in the future. They build a mountain of estimations out of a molehill of real data. Then they use these estimations to rig up their models to get their desired result.A real scientific theory can be verified with real time data. Theories about gravity can be verified with real, repeatable data in the present. Theories about rocketry can be verified with real, repeatable data in the present. Theories about how old a rock is cannot be verified. They just have to trust their own ""scientific"" model, and rely on extrapolations into the past or future which cannot be tested with real time data. Similarly, theories about whether mankind affects global temperature cannot be verified. That is arguably by design, because it allows the politicians peddling it to seize more power with their alarmism.>Anthropogenic catastrophic global warming/ climate change theories successfully predict outcomes.Lol. Incredible ego. So you think that your favorite rigged models are the only ones that can explain the data. Have you ever tried modeling data before? With such a limited amount of real data, there are many lines that fit. The only way they can even get enough data to get their desired predictions is by using extrapolated data from the past."
dcq2cem,ThrowawayTrumpsTiny,"Ugh.Other theories and models have been inaccurate. The ones that correlate to human emissions have been accurate. Your comment about predictions is nonsense- meaningful predictions are about the next 1-100 years, not thousands.All your nonsense about rocks being ""Derp bad science"" is meaningless- that would dismiss:EvolutionEarthquake scienceVolcano scienceHistorical records (eg Pompeii, little ice age, Ice Age)A good chunk of cosmology (formation of earth, theories on meteors and their effects, etc)If you're a creationist flat earther- then this is pointless anyhow.But if you dismiss ACGW and yet accept all of these other theories based on similar ""old rock"" analysis then that's just arbitrary selectivity aka hypocrisy."
dcq4n8i,ashweiuohsdkjl,">Other theories and models have been inaccurate. The ones that correlate to human emissions have been accurate. Your comment about predictions is nonsense- meaningful predictions are about the next 1-100 years, not thousands.Even so, they're extrapolating based on extrapolated past data. It's extrapolation on top of extrapolation. The XKCD you linked earlier had to use extrapolated past data, because last time I checked, there were no cavemen thousands of years ago running around with thermometers to record global temperatures for us.>All your nonsense about rocks being ""Derp bad science"" is meaningless- that would dismiss: Evolution Earthquake science Volcano science Historical records (eg Pompeii, little ice age, Ice Age) A good chunk of cosmology (formation of earth, theories on meteors and their effects, etc)And I do dismiss the majority of those as mostly theoretical and unverifiable. Those are just theories which could explain the effects we see, based on a tiny sliver of presently observable data. And just like a line through data, there are plenty of other theories and lines which would also fit. And again, you can't verify most of those theories by their nature, because you can't perform an experiment to test the theories in real time. This makes the adherents mostly ideological, not scientific. For example, evolutionists try to use their theory to disprove the existence of deities, even though evolution wouldn't disprove the existence of an all powerful being, anyway. It's entirely ideological, which explains why evolutionists get so defensive when a skeptic questions how they extrapolated such a vast theory from little to no real time data.>If you're a creationist flat earther- then this is pointless anyhow.Ad hominems is all your side has at the end of the day. You have to stand by your flawed theories to the end, because otherwise it would involve admitting there's a lot we can't know, and can't prove. And that's terrifying to you, because it could mean you're wrong about a lot of things, including the potential existence of a deity or higher intelligence. You're playing with fire, and you know it, and the only way you can cover your fear is by worshiping your extrapolations off of tiny amounts of real data.>flat eartherBad analogy. We have verified the shape of the Earth with countless experiments gathering real time data. You don't have to rely on extrapolations and BS models to understand that the shape of the globe is roughly spherical.>But if you dismiss ACGW and yet accept all of these other theories based on similar ""old rock"" analysis then that's just arbitrary selectivity aka hypocrisy. I don't unquestioningly accept those theories, because they could easily be incorrect. I also don't necessarily accept any other side's theories on those issues. Most of the competing theories necessarily extrapolate a tiny slice of incomplete recorded data (100 years or less) to create ""facts"" out of thin air to completely cover thousands of years of unrecorded history. There's a lot we can't know for sure, due to the fundamental nature of past and future events. It takes humility to admit that; humility that is sorely lacking among adherents to those theories.Also, you're appealing heavily to the bandwagon. Just because a lot of ""scientists"" decided to pool behind one unproven theory based on extrapolated data doesn't make it any more verifiable than any other. Flat Earth theory, as you alluded to, was also at one point the majority opinion."
dcr6k2e,ThrowawayTrumpsTiny,"Yeah, you're ignorant. I'm done."
dcrd57l,ashweiuohsdkjl,"""Ad hominem and peace out."" That's all the extreme left ideologues have, when we really get into examining your beliefs. See ya."
dcsqw07,ThrowawayTrumpsTiny,"Meh, I gave you real evidence. You responded with nonsense ad Hom attacks on the evidence (""but it's rooooocks, Derp!""). And your responses are so scientifically ignorant that it's clear further debate is meaningless. Arguing with you is like having a debate with someone over planetary motion... And then realizing that they deny **gravity**. If you deny the foundation of scientific theory, then scientific debate is meaningless against that level of ignorance.That ignorance is all extreme right ideologues and deniers have- when we really get into examining your beliefs.See ya."

dctv6d7,ThrowawayTrumpsTiny,"I've spent plenty of time studying ice core data. And satellite data- which explained why early aughts models overshot air temperature predictions (hint: because they undershot ocean temperature predictions, because the oceans acted as more of a heat sink than expected).You can call it all ""unscientific"" all you want. All that does is tell me that you haven't read the data, or don't understand the data, or don't know what scientific evidence is. All of which translates to the literal definition of ignorance. Not ad hominem fallacy - that would mean me attacking your *character* based on something irrelevant, like ""your arguments are invalid because you have purple hair"". But if you claim to have a strong argument on nuclear physics, and then show that you really only understand fluid dynamics and have zero grasp of nuclear physics, it is not a **fallacy** to say that you, specifically, are unqualified to make any argument at all about nuclear physics.Or in this case- climate change."
dctvk93,ashweiuohsdkjl,"> early aughts models overshot air temperature predictionsSo you just admitted the only way to verify a model is to actually travel to the future, and that some models have already been invalidated by real time data (in essence, invalidated by actual science). Which shows just how incredibly faulty your modeling ""science"" (extrapolation and estimation) actually is.>You can call it all ""unscientific"" all you want. All that does is tell me that you haven't read the data, or don't understand the data, or don't know what scientific evidence is. All of which translates to the literal definition of ignorance. Not ad hominem fallacy - that would mean me attacking your character based on something irrelevant, like ""your arguments are invalid because you have purple hair"". Calling someone ignorant does not an argument make. It just shows how incredibly weak your position is. Because you can't defend your position, you have to slander the other side's intelligence.I wrote:>I suspect you have never actually performed hands on experiments of any kind.You replied:>I've spent plenty of time studying ice core data. And satellite dataYou didn't answer me with regards to whether you have ever actually performed any real scientific experiments with real time data. I can only assume that means you cede the point about your own qualifications, and that the most ""science"" you have ever done is reading Excel spreadsheets posted on the internet. So because someone posted a bunch of comma separated values for you to peruse, that's enough for you to trust that climate change is scientific.It's fitting that someone who has never done any experiments with real time data would defend the most theoretical and wishy-washy estimations produced by academics."
dcud85p,ThrowawayTrumpsTiny,"Nope. The models discounted one factor. Their energy/ heat balances were correct. The earth retained the energy they predicted. It just retained it in a different place. Arguing that is like saying ""see, the microwave didn't work!"" when you microwave a bowl of soup and the bowl is smoking hot but the soup itself is cold. No, it worked- just not *exactly* the way you expected.>Real time experiments What the fuck are you on about? Have I traveled the globe measuring temperatures, personally, everywhere? Did I go to Hawaii to personally measure CO2 levels? What, only **your personal experiments** count, and ignoring data and experiments from other scientists is somehow valid? Are you a fucking Bradbury character? Nothing exists except what's in front of your face? You can't read available science and form conclusions? Any work I've done has been specific to my field- and whether that **is** climate change or not is irrelevant- there is no way one person could do all of that work individually.Here's an idea- have you done real time experiments about gravity over cliffs? You personally? How do you **know** that you won't just float up into the sky unless **you personally** go make sure? You do know that we still have no idea how gravity really works- maybe it's all a hoax by the lizard people! Prove them wrong! Find a cliff!You're not just discounting old rocks- you're literally discounting the foundation of how all of science works. One person can't study every phenomenon- so we trust specialists in that field to do so, and then their peers to repeat and validate their work.God, the arrogance and ignorance is just astounding.Oh, and you want a current comparison example? Venus vs the moon. One is 800F, the other is 0K."

I like your throwaway comment about ""the poors."" Like you are capable of empathy for those failure-to-bootstrap peons that you look down upon.The sad thing is- unless you're in the top 3% income-wise, I make more than you. I just know that science has also fundamentally proven that money <> happiness. All it does is reduce stress. Once ""lack of money"" stress is gone... It's just fuel for mindless consumerism. Or greed- which is what drives your kind. So I could give two shits if the guv'ment takes 38% (collecting ~20%), or 60% (collecting ~35%). I already know how to be happy, and money is not that important.See, people like you are incapable of empathy. You think you've found happiness, because you've found pleasure. Maybe through money, or sex, or entertainment- whatever. But the drugs will wear off, your tolerance will rise, the sex will grow repetitive, the toys predictable, and you'll wake up one day, bored with everything and utterly shocked that the pleasures have all gone sour, and the excitement faded.Because you've missed what is the actual source of human happiness (as proven with double blind test/ control scientific experiments!).And the source of that happiness is what drives me to give a shit about not pumping the atmosphere full of greenhouse gases (fyi they have run experiments with greenhouse gases. Hint: they trap heat like a greenhouse. Thus the name).And so I rant at clowns on the Internet, hoping foolishly that they'll suddenly gain wisdom. It's like screaming at a mosquito, hoping it will learn to play chess. Why do I do it? Meh- catharsis."

dcp2xvl,Irctoaun,"That link doesn't work, doing some research based on the title suggests it's talking about solar activity causing a mini ice age in 2030. That may well be true but it says nothing about what's been going on since the 40s. The sun potentially cooling down in the future tells us nothing about the cause of heating over the last 70 years. In fact all the data suggests [the sun's activity is nowhere near enough to explain the recent trends in the climate](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-07/models-observed-human-natural.png).

Unless you're working for or with them, you can see how your statements could come across as sensationalized speculation. I was only pointing out that you seem unaware of your doing this.As for your second bit: https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2017/01/17/obama-administration-digital-transition-moving-forwardThe information will remain. It's not censorship. It's two different administrations wanting to ensure the information posted on their edition of the site reflects their views. Trump doesn't believe climate change is real, so it would seem reasonable to expect his version of the site won't address it to the extent Obama's did, if at all. It's like the people in here are seriously surprised that he is tailoring the site to reflect his platform, however misinformed it may be. What did you think he was going to do?

Fuck where should I get my news all I've been doing is reading his tweets and the Whitehouse website and making my own mind ? Enlighten me .I agree the title is misleading but the sport of why they wrote the article isn't wrong. Take 2 minutes and read the link from your president and admit to yourself he doesn't give a fuck about climate change. Or admit that you don't believe in it. Either way I've done my part by linking you to a place that is 100% bias free of what Trump wants to to so let me know how I'm wrong in believing that Trump doesn't give a shit about the environment.

dcp3n77,Androne,Alright sure I'll bite. You're going to need to be specific and tell me what I said here today that proves I'm a charlatan. I gave you the energy plan from your governments website and it states they want to revive the coal industry. Is this in your mind good or bad for the environment? Why would someone who cares about the environment in general revive such a crappy technology when there are plenty of other technologies that are modern and american maid that he could be pushing forward?
dcp4mu6,Sk8erkid,Promoting intentionally misleading article as the truth when it is common fact the website would be changed within the next few days to reflect the current presidents policies. Its like you guys are trying to start mass hysteria. Foaming at the mouth Trump did this Trump did that. Nobody gives a shit about the orange pumpkin but why stoop so low.

dcp5fl0,Androne,"So by your logic if I post in here I support it? What are you doing? I agree the title is misleading and I wrote that a few times but to say that their energy policy doesn't say something about how they feel about the environment is kind of dumb isn't it? Can you read that and point out anywhere where they are trying to even hint they want to improve things in the future? Its not like he wrote ""we are going to revive the coal industry now and when we can switch off that stuff"". They wrote they want to have less regulations and revive the coal industry. Keep in mind that America is home to the company that seems to be pushing pretty hard for solar and improving battery tech and just built a giant factory in america."

dcppt4k,BrianWilsonsTent,A website page about climate change missing on day of inauguration?

The logic on /r/politics is fantastic and never waivers from insanity.
dcpr1z1,maybelator,"Trump appoints climate change denier at the head of EPA, declare that it is a chinese hoax multiple times, pulls the plug on the Climate Action Plan the minute he's in power?

Clearly he is an ally. He even held a flag!And the website even clearly state that they will promote coal and oil in lieu of renewable energy, and do not mention any civil right measure when the democrats had entire sections about it. It is not far fetched, it litteraly is their program. And we shouldn't be surprised neither, they have been very forward about it. If you don't see it now, you probably never will..."
dcpsfrv,BrianWilsonsTent,What is wrong with promoting coal and oil?
dcpss4w,maybelator,"Well they are very bad for the quality of the air. Coal alone kills [10.000 people every year in the US alone, and accounts for 100b in lost revenue due to sickness](http://www.rmi.org/RFGraph-health_effects_from_US_power_plant_emissions). Also those are not sustainable energies whose reserve are depleting fast, and all other major power (india, china, europe) are heavily investing renewable energies. Losing this tech race will be bad for the economy as well.Is this really news to you?"
dcpx8xz,BrianWilsonsTent,"Alternative energy is not where it should be if you want to talk about large scale production to supply the United States. Countless alternative energies (solar and wind, mostly) receive so many subsidies that it is artificially setting a price point per kWh of production. The technology is simply not there yet. I am hoping that there is a breakthrough in battery storage because one of the biggest drawbacks to alternative energy is finding a way to store and readily supply the electricity. I understand the effect of coal, but I don't think it is a bad thing to continue using the natural resources available. Sure, you can slowly implement alternative sources (which is already happening all over), but a lot of people for some reason are expecting a radical change in energy source or else the entire world is doomed."
dcpzyb9,maybelator,"By not taking into account the negative effect that coal and oil have on the environnement and the [direct economical consequences]( http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-energy/coal-and-other-fossil-fuels/hidden-cost-of-fossils) into their price, coal and oil are de facto much more subsidied than renewable energy.No one is saying to go full solar now. But those technologies need long term investmentd and a climate of trust to attract those investments. A country like France for example, use almost no coal and oil and is the biggest energy producer in europe, so it is not necessary at all (although it is more thanks to nuclear than renewable yet)."
dcq1ecx,BrianWilsonsTent,I will promote nuclear over renewable any day of the week.
dcqcblu,maybelator,"That's the idea, as much as possible with renewable, the bulk from nuclear and nothing from coal and oil. Trump is taking steps in the exact opposite direction though."

And the Iraqi president asked us to leave. So Obama was expected to break an international deal and occupy a sovereign nation? >Condoleezza Rice, who served as Bush's secretary of state, wrote in her 2011 book, “No Higher Honor,” that Bush did not want to set a deadline “in order to allow conditions on the ground to dictate our decisions.” She wrote that she met with Maliki in August 2008 and secured what she thought was an agreement for a residual force of 40,000 U.S. troops. But she said Maliki soon “reneged” and insisted on “the withdrawal of all U.S. forces by the end of 2011.” She said Bush “swallowed hard” and agreed to what she called “suitable language” to do just that."

When obamacare was implemented, my rates tripled and since i make too much money to qualify for any government programs, i'm straight up SOL. I'm *literally* being taxed for what i can't afford and i will blame obama for that until i can get past it. Until then, raising my taxes to pay for other people's insurance plans isnt going to help me out any today, and when i loose my house, it'll be one less person paying into the socialistic redistribution programs and one more person hanging onto them. Yes, increasing the range so that more people can get aid is nice in theory, but then your just passing the buck onto others who have their lives together and cause them the same duress. These people have the ability to leave the country and good luck trying to tax people who neither live nor work here.Was it fake sensational news when obama said the police acted stupidly when they arrested his professor? was it fake sensational news when obama said that trevon couldn't be guilty? the list goes on and on and caused a divide between those who believe they are oppressed by the police (whether they are or not is a different conversation and requires and entirely different method than the one chosen to weed it out) and the ones who believe the police dont blindly kill whoever they come across. i could easily site articles where more white men are shot and killed by police than blacks by percent and show other proof that more black people kill black people, but whats the point? your right about my poor phrasing, but its still accurate to say that man, in his course to protect and save, has done considerable damage. for example, by blindly putting out forest fires in the west of the united states, we have allowed the underbrush to build to the point that fires burn hotter and longer than they should. while they would normally have mostly burned through the forests quickly leaving the trees able to heal, our attempt at putting out fires as if all fire was pure evil and must be extinguished has brought us to the point that any fire must actually be extinguished because the trees can no longer survive it. again, there are other examples but this is getting quite lengthy and i dont wish to continue.you believe Condoleezza Rice? the same person who allowed herself to believe that civil protesters would naturally carry RPGs, rockets, motors, and enough weapons to take over a government compound over an internet video with 0 views 2 days before the attacks because it wasnt even posted yet and when it was posted, it was posted by a US government sponsored body? There were several other agencies that pulled out of that country the week before because it was getting dicey and it was all hidden from the american people. More to the point, no we did not fully pull out of iraq as is proof by berry's own platform when he was running for president that he would get us out of both wars in the middle east, so yes i do blame him for not listening to the military advisers."

Many complaints about being in that zone of no insurance were from people in those states (I'm not saying it didn't happen elsewhere).As for being taxed more, you are not, unless you're doing well financially. That's fake news.> We'll note that taxes have gone up for some as a result of Obamacare. The law imposes a 3.8 percent tax on net investment income that applies to people who earn more than $200,000 a year for singles, or $250,000 for joint filers. It also levies an additional Medicare tax of 0.9 percent on wages, salaries and self-employment income for people in those income groups.http://www.factcheck.org/2014/04/false-tax-claims/Next, Obama apologized for the ""acted stupidly"" remark.

My area just dealt with devastating fires, some started by kids. But is this Obama's fault or Congress's? > The National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy, as the Obama plan is called, seeks to provide funding to help protect 46 million homes in 70,000 communities at risk from wildfire. The strategy specifically calls out the importance of restoration and mitigation, and it clearly acknowledges climate change as a critical factor.> The proposal is facing fierce opposition. Rep. Steve Pearce, a New Mexico Republican, has been a particularly outspoken critic of the administration's intention to downplay firefighting in favor of forest management and fire prevention. He and some other politicians from the West want to keep all-out firefighting as the top priority – harking back to the 1930s, when the Forest Service's so-called ""10 am policy"" promised to extinguish new fires by the next morning. http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/america-is-burning-the-fight-against-wildfires-gets-real-20140723""you believe Condoleezza Rice?""I don't have to:>It is true that Bush signed an agreement, known as the Status of Forces Agreement, on Dec. 14, 2008, that said: “All the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.” http://www.factcheck.org/2015/08/bush-clinton-play-blame-game-in-iraq/https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html"

dcpagnu,morphinedreams,Trump's got a cabinet of neo-liberals. Trump himself benefits significantly from neo-liberal policy. It is baffling that you continue to use that word as an accusation without a hint of irony.
dcpew2d,Miss_Understoood,I've never heard that he benefits from neo-liberalsim. Please enlighten me. Maybe I am misusing neo-liberal.
dcpi8vj,morphinedreams,"[Neo-liberalism is just a name for the economic policies that sprung up around the 80's that promoted completely free-market capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism). If there was a problem, the market would fix it. If the market wouldn't fix it, there was no problem. Examples include enormous tax breaks for the upper tax brackets, using the claim that it promotes economic growth, and ""cutting red tape"" that make starting businesses or developing new products difficult. This was given the name trickle down economics, and has largely been discredited as not promoting significant growth either in GDP or jobs. Generally, the democratic party has bucked the trend against neo-liberalism. Promoting regulatory roles that inhibit free market capitalism from externalising costs of doing business. Reagan's administration was one of the major influences in neoliberal policy, and indeed his system was commonly called [""reaganomics""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics).Hillary was a bit of a washington hawk regarding her foreign policy, but she didn't actually have a lot in common with the people pushing neo-liberal policy other than being a wealthy politician. Trump's businesses have benefited considerably from tax breaks and lack of regulation (see Trump University for example). He is likely to repeal a lot of regulation, [such as the Dodd-Frank act](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-09/victorious-donald-trump-is-the-devil-wall-street-doesn-t-know) that contributed to reigning Wall-Street in after the GFC, [while his congress wants to dismantle the endangered species act](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/republicans-are-trying-their-damnedest-to-dismantle-the-endangered-species-act), his pick for secretary of education [wants to promote charter schools (private) options over public](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/what-new-orleans-can-teach-betsy-devos-about-charter-schools-214610). Etc.I don't get where people are thinking Hillary was a neo-liberal, but Trump and much of his cabinet and congressional allies are not? Could you explain where you got that idea?"
dcpignc,Miss_Understoood,With that definition I understand why... I was told that super left wingers are neo-liberals. I feel like you have neo-liberal and neo-conservative mixed up.
dcpk3qn,morphinedreams,">With that definition I understand why... I was told that super left wingers are neo-liberals.Nope, neoliberalism is probably most close to libertarianism, which usually associates itself with the political right in the US.[Neo-conservatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism) may be what you were looking for.>Neoconservatives typically advocate the promotion of democracy and promotion of American national interest in international affairs, including by means of military force and are known for espousing disdain for communism and for political radicalism.You could make the argument that Hillary is a neo-conservative, but I wouldn't since she is mostly just tough on foreign policy. You may also be able to make the same argument about Trump, but it's difficult since we only have his bravado and campaign statements to go by. Bombing ISIS round the clock and taking their oil is a *very* neo-conservative thing to say. On the other hand abandoning NATO is pretty anti-neo-conservative. Some of his appointments would be considered neo-conservatives though. He's using [Cheney as an advisor](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/dick-cheney-trump-surrogate-232746), as is Rex Tillerson, Michael Flynn could be called neo-conservative quite easily. Pence could also be called a neo-conservative. The majority of the neo-conservatives exist on the Republican bench, as you could probably guess by some of the defining characteristics, so while Trump isn't necessarily a neo-con, many of the people in the congressional majority are."

dcpc5az,Innovative_Wombat,"> Droughts and fires and floods are natural events. How do we wage war on them?Fires for one, particularly large forest fires can be reduced by allowing the forests to return to their regular burn cycle. We've been extremely good at shutting down fires but in the process allowed massively dense forests to occur with huge amounts of tinder all in the name of protecting outlying development. Hence why our forest fires in the past 20 years have been longer, bigger and hotter than forest fires in the past when we just let them burn. This is basic knowledge which suggests you aren't even remotely educated at even a community college level. Droughts can be mitigated by reducing population growth in areas prone to them, as well as water conservation practices. We can also slow down the change in climate that is making wetter places wetter and drier places drier. Floods can be mitigated as well by limiting population growth in flood bound areas, building infrastructure to handle large influxes of water in short periods of time, managing natural growth areas to raise absorption of water before it hits rivers and floodplains as well as slowing down the change in climate that is making wetter places wetter and drier places drier."

Food prices skyrocketed, nutrition-related diseases became widespread, and 1.5 million internal refugeesabandoned their farms and flooded into Syrian cities already crowded with 1.5 million Iraqi refugees displaced by the Iraq war, according to the study.> This influx of people exacerbated existing problems like unemployment, corruption and brewing discontent with the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which failed to respond to the situation, according to the study. In 2011, the unrest reached boiling point and erupted into the Syrian uprising.> If we follow the sequence of events like O'Malley does, it's reasonable to say the next fallen domino is the rise of ISIS.> ""Once the war had begun all sorts of pre-existing actors took advantage of the situation to pursue their goals -- ISIS was one and the collapse of Syria provided fertile ground for their actions,"" said co-author Richard Seager, a professor of climatology at Columbia University.> O'Malley's campaign also forwarded us manyreports and comments from the Department of Defense linking climate change and ISIS.

dd7k4ac,,Ok look up SAT scores instead by race.
dd7kfsb,,"The SAT would not be an accirate representation either as standardized testing is not used by psychologists in determining intellect. Also, due to loss of income in inner cities, the amount of black and hispanic dropouts would lead to unequal data. There is no data today to show fully accurate intellect based on race, as either the test os racially biased or inadequate or not enough people of one race do the test. However, all smaller scale tests show equal intellect with racially diverse tests."

Lets just say at a very high level, the beings who control the world, invented everything, and created modern technology (humans) are smarter than others that did not (dogs).That seems to work and would say I'm smarter than my dog. But if we apply that rule to humans....its false?"

That means all references to /sometcategory/sometopic/somefile.htm will likely all be 404s now. It is highly premature to ring alarm bells at this stage, 3 hours into the changeover.

But that page was removed because it was an Obama policy...and nothing more than a webpage--it carries no legislative weight.Can we possibly, just slightly, react with mindful pragmatism for a change?"

dcotolm,Reality_Facade,Your lack of understanding about how science works is truly astounding.
dcou4jv,great_wall_o_trump,Explain to me the tenets of your Gia worship
dcp1o1n,DrLeftCrRight,"Well, first we gather evidence related to carbon dioxide emissions from all man-made and naturally occurring sources. Then, we weight those and chart them. Then, we chart observed carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. We always get the same nearly 100% correlation. That's how we worship."
dcp6cdv,Sonic527,"Right, that's why in the 80's it was believed the earth was cooling, in the 90's the earth was warming, and today they just said fuck it, the earth is both hot and cold! Thank goodness we stopped our emissions along with China... Oh wait, China never stopped so looks like the Earth is still fucked and China lost nothing in the process..What really boggles my mind is how you think man is some sort of god and can control nature. You think man really has that much of an impact on nature? Did you not pay attention or think when you were in school? Even so, you smoke nature all the time so you would think you would have the best understanding of nature but you don't. I hope the next generation destroys you hippies (aka hipsters)"
dcpc9iz,DrLeftCrRight,"China is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions at that rate because they use cheap factory labor to keep one-seventh of the people on Earth employed making mostly useless shit for us. Enacting gov't regulation basically means hastening companies leaving China. Also, we've gone down a tiny bit, and it seems China has peaked a decade earlier than expected. We will see. Anyway, man basically is a ""god"" if you consider building cities in highly uninhabitable areas, setting foot on our moon, and sending probes to the farthest planetary body in our solar system ""god-like."""
dcpdhn6,Sonic527,"I don't consider that god like, I consider it man-like since man did it. Man will never be a god for god is what makes men push harder to become better. It's why athiests are such a cancer to society, they feel they are at the human peak and instead just shit on everyone who tries to be better."
dcpdl76,DrLeftCrRight,"I'm pretty sure most atheists I know think humans are really shitty in comparison to what we could be. Also, what does, ""Man will never be a god for god is what makes men push harder to become better?"" even mean? I'm pretty sure you wouldn't consider anything humans did god-like short of creating a universe."
dcpdyi6,Sonic527,"God is supposed to be some super natural being and apparently he made us in his image. As humans we try to push ourselves to become god, a level that is technically unreachable therefore humans will always push to try harder, become smarter, work harder, etc. and the end result is better humans every generation... Unfortunely atheists don't believe in a god therefore think they are at peak performance and result in shitty human beings. You could say it's all memes about atheists being fat virgins but really, tell me an athiest person that isn't like that."
dcpe7hi,DrLeftCrRight,"I'm not. Well, I am fat, but I'm far from a virgin, and I'm pretty sure I'm living a lot better life than most people. Also, I'm fat now. I used to be a Marine, but I was an atheist then too. I have never met an atheist (or anyone else) who thinks humans are at their peak."
dcpg8ui,_personofdisinterest,"There are plenty of deists who believe in climate change and you know, science in general."
dcpq2f6,Sonic527,"You keep saying it's science but it really isn't. Most charts aren't correct when they show data because they go from the average of 100 years to each years level. The only scientists who support climate change are tv celeb personalities, find me a science journal or climate change science book that exists that isn't just a hypothesis or theory but is fact."
dcrxmjk,Beatminerz,You're a fucking idiot
dcrzdzo,Sonic527,"Good argument, you've really proven me wrong, well done."
dcrzvjl,Beatminerz,"People like you can't be proved wrong. You refuse to accept science, there's nothing I can say to convince you that you're a fucking idiot, so I'm happy just knowing it and reminding you of it"
dcs4bsz,Sonic527,"Really doing a fine job proofing me wrong, would you at least like to do a citation?"
dcs5pxl,Beatminerz,"Nah I'm good. You saying there are no legitimate climate science papers is like saying the sky isn't blue. If that's what you think, you likely can't be convinced of anything unless Trump says it himself. And by the way it's *proving"
dcs62qz,Sonic527,"Me: Do you have a source.You: Nah, I win.If you want to start shit, at least try to make an argument. It makes it so much more enjoyable for the reader."
dcs79nn,Beatminerz,"Although I strongly doubt you will open the links, here you go. Some of the more influential ones.From the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the title is pretty self explanatory. The overwhelming consensus is that human activity has and is currently continuing to cause an increase in the average temperature of our planet: [The Scientific Consensus on Global Warming](https://leisureguy.wordpress.com/2007/09/04/the-scientific-consensus-on-global-warming/)One of the most influential climate change papers, showing that doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere will have the effect of increasing the average temperature by about 2°C: [Thermal Equilibrium of the Atmosphere with a Given Distribution of Relative Humidity](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469(1967\)024<0241%3ATEOTAW>2.0.CO%3B2)An interesting paper which studied more than 1700 species to show overwhelmingly that trends can be detected among a variety of lifeforms and ecosystems that directly indicate the effect of climate change on biological systems: [A globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts across global systems](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6918/abs/nature01286.html) If you can make it through these and still aren't convinced I'll find you some more. Just let me know :)"
dcs99jx,Sonic527,"Alright so I looked through the articles and this is what I have to say about each one.In the first article it says blatantly.“The scientific consensus might, of course, be wrong. If the history of science teaches anything, it is humility, and no one can be faulted for failing to act on what is not known. But our grandchildren will surely blame us if they find that we understood the reality of anthropogenic climate change and failed to do anything about it. “And the chart provided also seems incorrect, well hear me out anyway. It goes to 1916 – 2016. and there is warming, but the ice age which was about 110,000 years ago is clearly not shown on this graph. Wouldn't the blue lines be off the graph during this time? Couldn't it be argued the Earth has been warming since the time when there were few humans and no factories meaning humans could not effect this change and warming is a natural thing? Pretty sure during the time of dinosaurs the Earth was a very warm and tropical place so maybe it's returning to it's natural temperture.The second article“According to our estimate, a doubling of the CO2 content in the atmosphere has the effect of raising the temperature of the atmosphere (whose relative humidity is fixed) by about 2C. Our model does not have the extreme sensitivity of atmospheric temperature to changes of CO2 content which was adduced”As it says in the abstract it's an estimate and the model does not have a working atmosphere like Earth so pretty much bogus. I grant you there's a lot of graphs and equations in the article but doesn't really mean much if it's not even using all the factors of the experiment.The final articleGonna be honest, not sure what this paper is trying to say. I believe it's about species evolution due to climate change which makes sense, animals evolve in order to survive... so if climate change is real and we're evolving to survive, nature is taking it's course and allowing us to evolve the earth warmng so why are we trying to stop the earth from warming??That's what I have to say for those articles so I guess I'll take more if you got them :)"
dcsak70,Beatminerz,"If you're not going to accept any climate science until they have a fully functioning experimental Earth's atmosphere then you're not going to accept climate science. As for the last paper, it's less relevant and a little confusing but I take it you only read the abstracts. I appreciate you at least opening the links I provided,though as I said before, if you're unwilling to accept the science there's nothing else I can do. If you really want more sources just go to Google Scholar and search ""climate change"" or ""warming theories"" or something of the sort. I must say, if you are waiting for these to become 100% facts before you decide to accept the science, our planet will already be ruined. Science doesn't work that way, it's a dynamic process that builds on itself. Chemistry, for example, is an extremely well-established field of science, based very much on the study of the electron, yet no one knows what the physical structure of an electron even is! Pysicists worked for decades under the assumption of the existence of a gravity field, even though gravity waves had never been detected(until very recently). Science is hypothesis driven by nature, and although you're absolutely correct in saying that the hypothesis of greater than 99% of scientists might still be incorrect, I haven't seen a single alternative hypothesis for global warming aside from ""oh well, it's just a cycle things heat up things cool down"". You may deny their conclusions, but you can't deny the raw data. Our planet is heating up drastically. CO2 levels have increased drastically. CO2 is very good at absorbing/scattering thermal radiation. It doesn't take a scientist to put those pieces together BTW I apologize for being a dick to you earlier, it wasn't necessary and it doesn't help get my point across. I just feel very strongly about this issue and wish people didn't have this sense that scientists are fabricating data/hypetheses for personal gain"
dcsb63q,Sonic527,"I'll respect your statements because 1. You're speaking to me like a fellow human and 2. I see you're very passionate about this. Unfortunely you are correct, I refuse to accept it because it's not 100% for certain and that's my problem but do realize science is not always correct and new discoveries can create, alter, and destroy theories in seconds. The other problem is if we do make the changes the entire Earth would have to follow suit and that's just not gonna happen, humans are selfish creatures. Every country could agree to stop CO2 levels but in the end someone will not follow on their agreement and that's just how humans are..Stopping CO2 levels will also make a lot of people lose out in the workforce and you can argue that they will die if we continue these emissions but those same people will die anyway due to being unable to pay for their survival. It's a very bleak situation. Sorry we couldn't agree today but I will hold faith that a discovery in the future may bring new hope or ideas on what to do or an even better and clearer understanding of what's actually happening to the world but until it's 100% confirmed I won't believe in it."
dcsbohi,Beatminerz,Fair enough.
dcou0bt,Flooblebox,"Ah yes the old ""faith in scientist is the same as blind faith"" argument. I've never performed a biopsy on my father to prove he has cancer, but I trust the medical science that proves he did. How is it any different then listening to a doctor?"

dcoyu78,jweezy2045,"I'm not the person you are replying to, but I have. Science doesn't require faith, it requires some motivation and careful thought. Anyone can do some science if they put their mind to it. The larger reason why even people who didn't do the science have for sciences not being a religion is scientists attitude towards doublechecking. Scientists encourage people to question their work and make sure it's as correct a science (peer review), while in religious contexts actively questioning the validity of claims made is discouraged."

dcoyuzu,Nooku,"Just like Climate Change is about linking scientific evidence together,let's start linking political events together that have caused President Donald Trump to get elected:The biggest mistake the Left has made in the past decade, has been the marginalization and degradation of all the people who ever dared to question multiculturalism and open borders. People who ever dared to speak out against regressive religions like Islam were silenced and marginalized, pushed in a corner with the ""racism"" label.This constant marginalization, the Political Correctness that has consistently shut down any attempts for important debates about a growing threat of an extremist fascist ideology disguised as just a religion. It caused a mass flock of silenced individuals; socially silenced in real life, banned for *racism* online; individuals no longer allowed to speak their minds. In the free West, it has caused a mass flock towards right-winged parties, the rise of populist candidates: * Quran-burning Wilders in the Netherlands, * Sharia-law fearing Le Pen in France, * the refugee crisis fueled Brexit, * the birth of Muslim-skeptic Pegida movement in Germany, Belgium, Ireland, Switzerland, Finland, Poland, ... * **and now, the protectionist President Donald Trump in the USA.**The Leftists have caused a major built up of frustration and anger in millions of silenced people. And from today, we are all going to pay the price.Do not put the blame on the Trump supporters, don't blame the nationalists, don't blame the Islam-o-skeptics (disregarded as *Islamophobes*).I think the blaming has caused enough damage already, has it not, dear Leftists?Today, tomorrow, and in the years to come, we are all paying the steep price for your Political Correctness.I must say, turning a progressive world into a regressive one by people who call themselves progressives, is quite an achievement. Congratulations."

You can swallow as many of those red pills as you want, and dive as deep down your rabbit hole as you can. It won't change the science of climate change, It won't change the demographics of our country. This election had nothing to do with ""political correctness"" it had to do with the growing wealth gap in this country and the anti-establishment anger that always goes with feeling like you are getting poor while others are getting richer. Democrats ran an establishment candidate and still won the vote, but they didn't drive turnout in battle grounds, and that strategy cost them. You can try and paint whatever beautiful narrative of the plight of the white man, but as a white man, I can tell you that it's all bull shit. This was one of the narrowest electoral college victories in the history of the country, and if you think that you are winning those rust belt states after another 4 years of republican attacks on the middle class, the loss of health care for millions of those same working class people you are going to be disappointed.

dcqnx59,morphinedreams,"Are you honestly that ill-informed? Many plants are already CO2 saturated, meaning they don't benefit from any increase (these are called C4 plants). Most plants are nitrogen or potassium limited, so more CO2 isn't going to help them grow. CO2 is only one of many things necessary for plant growth."

All the Obama stuff has to come down. All the trump stuff has to go up. And it happens starting when trump took the oath."
dcop1e4,MrLeeRob,Stuff from the previous presidents doesn't come down. The websites at the moment of his stepping down are frozen in time and archived.
dcopbdp,washheightsboy3,Right. But the domain whitehouse.gov doesn't get you to the outgoing administrations pages any more. That's what people are freaking out about. If you go to https://www.whitehouse.gov/lgbt you get a generic landing page. I suspect that's a temporary thing.
dcooexs,GhostOfWhatsIAName,"Here we are, counting on China and India to take the lead.

dcooujt,ricardogce,"The thing is, I do expect progress will be made, as you say, with China and India taking a primary role. And in the process, we'll be left behind as a loud but ultimately ineffectual former hegemon. When I was a kid and learned about the Roman Empire, I imagined its fall to be a single event, the result of one final conflict. But it just rotted out from within. When the Barbarians took over, they often had their own puppet Emperors, even though it was the Barbarian chieftain of the day who held the real power. The ""Empire"" continued to exist, nominally, and generations of Romans lived and died without ever realizing it had become a fiction, until eventually it slowly dissolved. Some people find the idea of America losing its place in the global order to be unimaginable, because they expect it would take a massive conflagration to make us lose power. But when it's time for us to go the way of the British and cede the century to a new superpower, it will happen gently, and almost without us noticing it. It might even start over something so simple as climate change."

Trump may not go out of his way to shovel government funding into these sorts of things, but current energy sources will give way to more efficient ones naturally over time.>in a time where pollution has been steadily decreasing we now get a president who doesn't care about itWell there you have it. Pollution is steadily decreasing. You think that's the type of trend that will really reverse just based on who the president is? >and just wants to further his buisness ventures.One, he literally just gave up his business ventures.

But The website since it usually holds policy data and there is a transfer stage .. the pages and policies could have been written during the transfer stage and immediately posted. That's how stuff like this works, but differs from organization to organization. I am not judging as this is probably just a hindsight and his team maybe trying to fix it. I am just offering how in reality these things are usually executed.When a New CEO takes over a company, the day that happens the companies website USUALLY changes the information to show current CEO and profile on the same day.

Yet he's added energy plans onto whitehouse.gov regarding natural gas, oil, and ""clean coal,"" and not a thing about renewable energy. >Protecting clean air and clean water, conserving our natural habitats, and preserving our natural reserves and resources will remain a high priority.Seems a bit hypocritical to focus on fossil fuels while expressing concern over clean air and water.

Do these people want their grandchildren to grow up in a world that is dry, cracked, and free of beautiful wildlife? Do they care? Not about the environment, but MONEY. That's ALL they seem to care about, and they are severely missing the fact that many people don't share their views. They are going to be so unpopular, so dreadfully hated, that it will crumple America from the inside out. We're fucked. If they are truly the brilliant masterminds, they will realize that they need to work with and for EVERYONE, not their overlord. Not their party. But for EVERYONE. That's who they serve. From my understandings, Obama tried to work with the Republicans who dragged his name through the mud and it didn't work. Trump won't even try. He'll probably ship them all off to Oregon where they can have a 'liberal safe space'.Being Centrist with Socially Liberal and Fiscally Conservative leanings SUCKS right now. It REALLY does. I'm going crazy. I want to believe that everything will be ok... but oh man, nothing I have seen is leading me to believe that. Trump stans, please help me.

dcoy7ci,blue_whaoo,>President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule.
dcqoei3,slammcbuttneck,I appreciate your view point and informing but I don't share the view point. I think incentives tend work better than punishment like with drug use. I think the environment is important but regulations just don't do enough usually.also my comment was more a comment on the political climate of the US. Its too much knee jerking
dcqra1m,blue_whaoo,"I think that it is pretty clear which direction Trump will go with energy policy, given his previous statements, and given that he has appointed Exxon Mobil's ex CEO to his cabinet.And I would wager that he is not going to give incentives to renewable energy producers. And it is impossible to protect the environment without regulations. If it is more profitable to damage the environment, it will happen. By removing (as he says) ""harmful and unnecessary policies"" he is actually creating incentives (profit) to companies to harm the environment.I guess where I disagree is that I think that many of the existing policies are necessary, because I believe and care about global warming. Those who disagree either don't believe, or don't care. There will always be those who will clear forests, wipe out fisheries, or pollute the environment for their own self enrichment. That is why certain things need to be regulated. Incentives alone will not prevent such actions."

dcys00f,Clintius_Maximus,"I think the only positive thing to come out of this whole mess, is that it highlights just how broken democracy is. Now, I'm not saying we should throw democracy in the trash can and turn to communism, but maybe we need to start again. We need to take the core principles of democracy, tweak them and incorporate more modern ideas; principles founded on a system of scientific reasoning and logic. A system that isn't just secular, but perhaps anti-religious in nature, not through bigotry, but through truth and education. A while back, during his 2016 stand-up ""FreeDumb"", aussie comedian Jim Jeffries said something that struck a cord with me. He said that religious people are slowing us down. He said that the world is a train track, and society is the train. And at the front of the train, we have the engine room where we have the people who are running the show. We call these people scientists and engineers. These are the people dragging us all along, as they have for countless centuries. Long story short we have a giant carriage right at the back, 50x bigger than the front carriage. Filled with the rest of society. The anti-vaxxers. The Anti-GMO crowd. The Trump supporters. You name it. This carriage is so big that right now the carriage is hardly moving. And if those at the front were to just pull the pin, the train could move a lot faster.So what if we did just that, at least for a little while. Maybe its time for scientists to stop leading society from the shadows and stepped up to the plate. We need a nation of our own to call home, free from the meddling of corrupt politicians and the prejudice of the ignorant. The Seasteading Institute is already working towards creating floating cities. Out in international waters we have the opportunity to do what is necessary to save the rest of save the human race. Once they see the progress we've made, once they see that we were right all along, we can turn our wicked, techno-marvel train around and pick up the stragglers.If people won't listen, then you need to show them. Its time for scientists to become leaders."

dcoot7u,zatchj62,I'm not sure you understand how science works. There's disagreement on literally every studied phenomenon; the skepticism that characterizes science is what makes it great. 97% of scientists agreeing on anthropogenic climate change is far more agreement than the vast majority of topics in science have.
dcooxm2,,"97% of scientists the US government chooses to fund and publish, read the article."
dcotvdf,Androne,I hate to break it to you but the US isn't the only country studying climate change . But yeah it's more believeable that there is a global conspiracy between all these scientists that can clearly demonstrate they are competent in their fields to prove climate change is a thing. Also the world is flat.
dcoqbyr,zatchj62,"I did. It doesn't support your statement. The article is about putting an end to studies funded by fossil fuel companies that try to appear unbiased, which is understandable since its a huge conflict of interest. As someone in a scientific discipline, I can assure you that the NSF and other agencies don't cherry pick proposed studies to push some hidden agenda. Further, studies are funded before data is collected, so these agencies have no way of knowing the findings when they provide funding. You get some studies with results like the couple that are listed in your linked article, but the vast majority indicate that it's caused by human activity."
dcoqfnk,,"> Additionally, studies are funded before data is collectedThis is disengenuous as fuck... What is a hypothesis? When does it enter the discussion? Answer reallllllly specifically, because I know you know that it blows your point out of the water, okay? > but the vast majority indicate that it's caused by human activity.Which, if you were a scientist, would lead you to say ""The studies are repeatable, but we still need more data to draw predictive conclusions"" which is what real climate scientists say."
dcoqxdp,zatchj62,"Oftentimes pilot data is initially collected so you're sure the study is feasible (and that data isn't included in the final data set), but other than that data is collected after hypotheses are formulated. Hypotheses are provided in the initial proposal you submit for funding, which is done before you collect data. I'm not really sure how that's ""disingenuous as fuck.""For your second point, I said they indicate, not prove. Nothing is ever proven in science, just strongly supported. As more and more studies provide evidence for the same conclusion, we can say more confidently that human-caused climate change is an existing phenomenon."
dcor9wq,,"> Hypotheses are provided in the initial proposal you submit for funding, which is done before you collect data. I'm not really sure how that's ""disingenuous as fuck.""Right. So, before you get funding you have to tell them the conclusions you think/want to reach. How does that support your postulation that the outcome of a study is unknown when it starts? It doesn't. You're being dishonest to push a viewpoint you know is false but you know people who don't know much about how science actually works will believe. Stop. > For your second point, I said they indicate, not prove.Where did I say prove? > As more and more studies provide evidence for the same conclusion, we can say more confidently that human-caused climate change is an existing phenomenon.There you go! Now you're talking like you're an actual scientist."
dcorm66,zatchj62,">Right. So, before you get funding you have to tell them the conclusions you think/want to reach. How does that support your postulation that the outcome of a study is unknown when it starts? It doesn't. You're being dishonest to push a viewpoint you know is false but you know people who don't know much about how science actually works will believe. Except you're not trying to prove your hypothesis. You go in trying to disprove your hypothesis in an attempt to eliminate personal bias.I'm not being misleading. I'm literally describing how science works (or at least how it's supposed to work). Stop being condescending if you want a reasonable discussion."
dcos24b,,"> Except you're not trying to prove your hypothesis. You go in trying to disprove your hypothesis in an attempt to eliminate personal bias.Dude... > So, before you get funding you have to tell them the conclusions you think/want to reach.Why do you think I phrased this this way? Because I knew no matter what I said, you were going to make this point. because it's the next logical progression of dealing with this in the most disingenuous way possible. Can you please explain to me the functional differences between what I said and your correct? Put another way, why do you think i didn't literally just say that? Yet another way, how does what you said mean that what I said is untrue? I'll explain it yet a different way. These are all just paraphrases to make this easier. You said:""Nobody knows how a study is going to come out when it starts""I then replied: ""They do have hypotheses, and that is functionally the same thing"" you then replied: ""No you're trying to disprove your hypothesis, so that means that there isn't such a thing as a hypothesis and it doesn't elucidates the goals of the study"" And so I'm confused. How do you honestly think you aren't being disingenuous? > Stop being condescending if you want a reasonable discussion.Are you kidding me? You're misrepresenting things directly to my face as if I won't notice."
dcot369,zatchj62,"I'm not intentionally misrepresenting anything, so you playing the victim here is getting old.The amount of times one's hypothesis is disproved in some way is remarkably high, which is why I said that even though a researcher has a prediction of what they think will happen, neither them nor the agency providing funding know the study's results when a proposal is submitted.My ""Except you're not trying to prove your hypothesis. You go in trying to disprove your hypothesis in an attempt to eliminate personal bias"" comment was a direct response to ""So, before you get funding you have to tell them the conclusions you think/want to reach."" You using the term ""want"" was what I took issue with. While it's unfortunately not true for all scientists, one should go in wanting to disprove their hypothesis (instead of wanting to reach the hypothesized conclusion, as you state). Doing so reduces bias in the study."
dcotgvj,,"Dude - answer a single simple question for me. What is the functional difference between what I said, and your correction? What is it?"
dcotzj0,zatchj62,Dude bro dude - Because the outcome isn't known just because you have a hypothesis.

The scientific community naturally began to support the left *on matters of climate change* because the right refused to acknowledge it.

If there wasn't money involved, climate change would be pretty universally agreed upon. The problem is that people listen to oil lobbyists instead of scientists because academia is ""full of elitists, unlike those oil guys! They worked hard for their millions!"""
dcopx29,,"So you're saying there is dissent, you get that, you're just putting forward a conspiracy theory that all of that dissent is being put out there by terrible people trying to deceive others? I'm not being shitty, I'm trying to get what you're saying."
dcoqcp9,DG729,"No, I'm trusting the people who have devoted their lives to furthering knowledge and understanding of our world, rather than the people who have devoted their lives to profit. I really truly think the dissent is only in the interest of profit. Think about these two statements:""The amount of industrialization and emissions in the recent years is having a major effect on a planet that hasn't been touched until relatively recently.""""The people who think the above are lying to you because they want more power over the world.""Which really sounds more like a conspiracy theory to you? Which side do you think has more reason to lie?"
dcoqmjv,,"> No, I'm trusting the people who have devoted their lives to furthering knowledge and understanding of our world, rather than the people who have devoted their lives to profit.This assumes that everyone dissenting isn't a scientist? Many of them are? They also have devoted their lives to further knowledge. Why should their dedication go completely ignored? > Which really sounds more like a conspiracy theory to you?Well see, you're being disingenuous like everyone here is. You're setting up a strawman and you know that. More accurately it would be ""A group of scientists believes that humans are causing climate change"" ""A different group of scientists believe that humans don't cause climate change, but they don't actually believe that. In reality, all of these scientists are bad people who only care about money and so they lie about dissenting"" Which seems more like a conspiracy theory to you?"
dcoqz2y,DG729,"The studies that suggest climate change is a problem far outnumber those that disagree, and many of the studies that disagree with climate change were funded by people with interests in the oil industry.

dcosx34,Rotkreuz,They aren't bad people. And they aren't real scientists. They are fake scientists. By that I mean they are pretending to be scientists and produce papers disputing what 99% of the scientific community has proven to be indisputable fact.
dcoszxm,,They are fake scientists? Dude what happened to all the talk of dedicated their lives to the pursuit of knowledge? You know someone else might have said that actually... I'm having trouble keeping all these convos separate. That's a really shitty thing to say.

dcoop42,duhcartmahn2,"Ahh, washington times, a bastion of accurate reporting, especially when they describe following scientific consensus as a ""government crackdown on climate dissent""... What a piece of shit article.Lets look at what scientists actually say about ACC:http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002/meta> The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming. [...] We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies.So 97% of published papers agree that Humans are causing climate change. But it's a political issue to say that there is consensus on the issue?"
dcootxd,,http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/10/climate-change-consensus-increasingly-questioned-a/Read the article. It's literally about how you can't get funding or find a place to publish research that doesn't confirm this.

dcop0hw,silent__potato,"I did click your link and acknowledge the dissenting studies! My understanding is that studies which are skeptical of anthropogenic climate change are very much in the minority, are they not? An issue with such profound potential effects surely warrants the administration's attention even if there is some dissent.My original comment came about because I was alarmed that you'd classify climate research as politics masquerading as science. I really don't think the tribalism of ""your side"", or sides at all help us here. Issues as big as this matter much more than perceived winners or losers, surely?"
dcop524,,"> Issues as big as this matter much more than perceived winners or losers, surely?Right. So the left shouldn't be suppressing all dissenting scientists until they manufacture the consensus they want. They should get their hands off of it and offer support and funding that leads to whatever the true conclusion is, instead of the conclusion they want. I believe the scientists. But I also believe that the dissenting scientists aren't bad people."

I also lack the time and skill to check their methodology, but as a layperson I am inclined to go with the majority of the professional research.Is there a lot of evidence for research being suppressed?

That's 100% my stance. Weird that nobody else replying to me has actually tried to figure that out...Anyway, > Is there a lot of evidence for research being suppressed?It seem there is some, and there is certainly evidence that accusations of fraudulent research are being used to chill any dissenting scientists. Moreover, it seems the consensus is NOT as strong as people would suggest. Although it is impossible to get studies published in the US that deny human-caused climate change, you can do so elsewhere, and 600+ such studies have been publish since 2014. Honestly, I'm just tired of the left on this country setting the world up in such a way that anything that isn't their approved stance is bullshit. It's infuriating, and it's just as anti-intellectual as anyone that says evolution don't real cause Jesus."

Walker demanded the free market think tank's climate research and communications, a rising tide of evidence has challenged the narrative that increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are driving floods, drought and other disasters.As of March 27, researchers had published 133 “consensus-skeptical” papers this year, bringing to 660 the number of such studies appearing since January 2014, blogger Kenneth Richard wrote on the skeptics website NoTricksZone.“There has been quite an uptick in papers that question the consensus this year,” said Anthony Watts, who runs the influential WattsUpWithThat? website.Studies published on his website and others include in the past few weeks include those that say:• An exhaustive study published April 7 in Nature by University of Stockholm researchers examining hydrological patterns going back 1,200 years found that climate models cannot accurately predict extreme rainfall and drought.Please bear in mind that I'm not interested in a blogger indirectly telling me how many papers there are and attorney generals are not climatologists.Literally the best example they could come up with is about drought.You want to have a serious discussion?

dcpapwm,morphinedreams,"We can get very accurate estimates of how much carbon dioxide we are releasing. We can view records like ice cores, sediment cores, biological proxies (ask me what this is if you don't understand) and tree rings to determine what the climate was like in the past and the CO2 concentrations. They all tell the same story, as CO2 concentrations go up, so does temperature. We can overlay CO2 concentrations in recent history with our consumption of fossil fuels. They start increasing at roughly the same point, with dips and spikes during specific events like world war II and petroleum shortages. You will need to look at things like temperature records from NASA and compare them to observations like the ones from Mauna Loa Observatory."
dcpcw5n,GrassHopper420MaryJ,"Okay first of all I don't understand how they can tell so much about carbon levels at different time periods from ice cores, sediment cores, biological proxies and tree rings; However, these claims sound probable, since scientists are smart and stuff. It's still impressive though, they can examine these respective natural phenoma's and some how extract a data-log for carbon levels at different time periods... Cool. Oh wait, am I understanding you wrong? Are you saying that by observing these indicators, it's not that we learn about carbon levels at different time periods, but rather the information we extract shows that higher CO2 levels is directly related to temperature change. Did I get that right? I hope i'm making sense.And then you go on to say that if you look at data for carbon density in our atmosphere, it has spikes and dips around world events where we were using more and less fossil fuels.So first you argue that carbon causes temperature to go up, and then you argue that carbon level's have been going up. Great response thanks. I don't know what you're talking about when you say NASA temperature records and compare them to observations like the ones rom Mauna Loa Observatory, i'll look into it."
dcpjda1,morphinedreams,"> Okay first of all I don't understand how they can tell so much about carbon levels at different time periods from ice cores, sediment cores, biological proxies and tree ringsIce gets deposited each year, often in very thin sheets of snow. Ice cores have water in them, but as ice freezes it traps air in it. Ice from 10,000 years ago is going to have air from 10,000 years ago. This air will tell you what the CO2 and nitrogen levels were like in the atmosphere back when humanity was first discovering it was a good idea to grow food. Ice cores commonly go back hundreds of thousands of years, if we dig deep enough.Sediment cores are similar, and can be used for figuring out things like temperatures.Biological proxies are things like plants or animals we know don't tolerate certain conditions. If we find an arctic plant, fossilised down near florida, we know that it was once very cold there. Figuring out how old the fossil is tells us how cold it would have been at that point in time.Tree rings are often used to estimate the age of things, and you can infer the climate from looking at how the rings are spaced since they generally get laid down annually. These usually don't go back very far, and are only good for recent comparisons.>Oh wait, am I understanding you wrong? Are you saying that by observing these indicators, it's not that we learn about carbon levels at different time periods, but rather the information we extract shows that higher CO2 levels is directly related to temperature change. It's both. Temperature is harder to gauge, but you can do so by analysing the composition of something like a sediment core, where in the ocean there are animals who build calcium carbonate skeletons. [This NASA website](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/schmidt_01/) explanation is probably more succint than I could ever put it:>What makes calcium carbonate important? The carbonate, originally dissolved in the oceans, contains oxygen, whose atoms exist in two naturally-occurring stable isotopes, 18O and 16O. The ratio of these two isotopes tells us about past temperatures. When the carbonate solidifies to form a shell, the isotopic ratio in the oxygen (written as δ18O) varies slightly depending on the temperature of the surrounding water. The change is only a tiny 0.2 parts per million decrease for each degree of temperature increase. Nevertheless, this is sufficient for us to be able to estimate the temperature of the water in which the forams lived millions of years ago. From this, we can see that temperatures in the Arctic Ocean were about 10-15°C warmer at the time of the dinosaurs than they are today!You might be interested to know that these same calcium carbonate skeletons, are responsible for the really white beaches you see on tourist ads and potentially on past and future holidays. All that sand is from skeletons built out of the stuff over many millions of years.>And then you go on to say that if you look at data for carbon density in our atmosphere, it has spikes and dips around world events where we were using more and less fossil fuels.Correct.>So first you argue that carbon causes temperature to go up, and then you argue that carbon level's have been going up. Great response thanks. I don't know what you're talking about when you say NASA temperature records and compare them to observations like the ones rom Mauna Loa Observatory, i'll look into it.NASA keeps temperature records for things like air temperature and SST (sea surface temperature). I believe NOAA does too. [Mauna Loa](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/) is one of the most famous observatories because it's continually tracking CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, and has been doing it continuously since around the 50's. You can see their CO2 tracking so far, [here](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2_data_mlo.png). Fun fact: It is actually organisations like this that are most imperiled by government temporary shutdowns. It creates holes in what should be continuous records."
dcpmc7p,GrassHopper420MaryJ,"So from looking at the isotope ratio we can see that the ocean is 10-15 degrees Celsius warmer in the days of the dinosaurs than they are today. Are you saying this increase is due to human acvitity? That since the Industrial revolution or whenever we really started messing shit up, that we've increased the temperatures by 10-15 degree's Celsius? That seems a bit much doesn't it? Or are you not blaming these 10-15 degree's on human activity but rather just saying that through the methods explained we can tell that the temperature has changed by this much.Also, as far as learning about temperatures in the past from sediment cores, how does this work? It seems pretty impressive that scientists are able to tell how long ago specific ice sheets were frozen and then find out how much Carbon is in them; and they are finding Carbon levels were the same in all the ancient ice for a very long time and then ice frozen since the Industrial Revolution or something has had gradually more and more Carbon? So I'd assume only ice at the very top has excess Carbon in it. Does sediment layer itself out at a predictable rate through time so by analyzing sediment at a certain depth we can somehow study it and learn about the temperature of that time period?"

dcpbyf2,jacksonfalls,"Folks, I hate to break it to you. As a firm believer in climate change, I'd say this makes no difference what-so-ever. Our best chances at aggressively curbing CO2 was with Barak Obama, but despite best intentions our CO2 levels are nowhere near where they need to be if we want to reverse climate change:https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/us-greenhouse-gas-inventory-report-1990-2014The reason there was a large dip in 2008 is not because he took office, but because of the Great Recession; as economic activity slowed, so does CO2 emissions.Holding steady or mildly increasing isn't going to cut it. Emissions need to be reduced drastically and not just in the US, but everywhere, including the biggest emitter, China. The kind of cuts needed are going to be painful to everyone and I don't believe that many of us will be willing to make those kinds of sacrifices, and it isn't fair to ask people to give up things and behavior that they take granted for.So while Trump will likely increase CO2 emissions if he pursues his oil and coal friendly policies, we are only going to be to slightly _more_ fucked.

dcotj2t,MartinDeth,"Source: google something like ""global warming predictions from 19XY"" or something like that. Also notice how it's not called ""global warming"" anymore but ""climate change"". Another constant aside from changing the year is updating the thesaurus to reflect the current narrative. I wonder how many more doomsday climate change predictions need to come and go for people to start doubting the BS. Here's one collection of predictions i found after 3 seconds of googleing, feel free to look for more http://dailycaller.com/2015/05/04/25-years-of-predicting-the-global-warming-tipping-point/ . And also I'd love to hear how if we don't reduce fossil fuels by 20XY we will be doomed so feel free to inform me."

dcqbliq,MartinDeth,"It's not even certain that they will make the 0.3 over the next CENTURY with all that money. But people think it's a good idea to throw money in that sinkhole. I'm not strictly against the idea of global warming, sorry, climate change. I just can't believe it when some people say because it's too hot in parts of Asia, people started to migrate west. Yeah, I remember reading that. And I'm not American so i don't know what exactly they're doing over there but from things I've read, some legislations or whatever hurt many jobs that have to do with so called ""environmentally unfriendly"" workplaces. If Trump wants to rework those laws to make work in fields that leftists describe as ""environmentally unfriendly"" i say it's a good idea. Hurting your own economy and people in the name of some fairy tale is (and i know this sounds shocking) a bad idea."
dcqjahx,Oceanswave,"Let's get ahead of the power curve and take that money and use it to boil the oceans instead, think of all the jobs and manufacturing dollars that will create!"
dcqpj9z,MartinDeth,"Judging by your name and the fact that you've used that account for a while (unlike many others i faced) i will make the safe assumption that you're a big environmental fanatic. Good on you sir, best of luck in saving this planet that I'm seemingly too ignorant to realize that it's near death."
dcqttuv,Oceanswave,"Let's throw studies out for a second. They're created by humans and humans are fallible. Let's just use something that we *can* observe with our eyes and our hands for a second.You're not from the US, but I'm sure you've got a modern refrigerator in your house -- maybe not, but there's a good chance. Now you've put your hand behind the fridge and felt those coils on occasion. Yup. they generate heat.Now let's zoom out a bit -- you might live in a flat or perhaps a stand-alone house, but you've probably got an A/C unit attached to that. Relatively the same process as your refrigerator, doesn't chill as much, but cools a large area. If even you haven't stood in front of the A/C unit by your house or condo or office building -- if you've felt those refrigerator coils I hope we can come to the conclusion that those A/C units generate some heat.Let's zoom out some more -- Ever take a flight across Europe at night? Fly over, say Hamburg or London and look out the window of the plane? Yeah, there's a ton of those tiny lights stretching to the horizon. And each of those tiny dots probably isn't a full house, or a condo but a street light. so each one of those dots is probably say 1/4 a city block so there's maybe 6-7 houses or condos per dot.Now pretty much each one of those houses/condos/office buildings has one of those A/C units cranking out heat. We'll ignore the wintertime for now, but in the summer, we can just surmise that a bunch of extra heat being generated across all those houses and condos across Europe the US, Australia and more and more in Asia.Now those A/C units weren't always there -- they've really begun to spring up in the last 30 years or so, a bit later in parts of Europe, and Asia perhaps in the past maybe 10-15 years. You might have seen some of those gifs around that [show city growth from the air](http://www.businessinsider.com/gifs-of-chinese-city-growth-2014-3)Now doesn't it seem possible that all those A/C units attached to the structures in all the world could maybe effect the climate just a little perhaps? That a little bit of man-made climate change could exist due to those billions of A/C units that we use to enjoy our 70 degree during the summer?And this is without thinking of how cities can be warmer than rural areas just because there's more pavement and buildings absorbing the heat of the sun. Or how all those A/C units are being powered. Or the effect of billions of cars around the globe (those bonnets are warm to the touch after a sunday drive) . Or the effects of who knows what being released into the air. Remember those smog-filled Los Angeles sunsets from the 80s that seemly went away with unleaded gas and tighter emissions controls? Meh.Ignore all that because it's all a fairy tale from China because underneath those Shanghai smog clouds there's unicorns that poop gold bricks that they don't want the rest of the world to have.So we'll just use those dollars that we could have used to save ourselves from ourselves and use it to slowly boil the oceans indirectly.Because the job growth from that can be measured and those coal miners will be happy with their $14/hour putting in a glorious hard day's work and america will be great again and in a short 5-20 years statistically the current regime will be dead and buriedand the next generation can build more A/C units and expand the cities and mine more coal out of the ground and all will be fine and dandy."
dcqut4b,MartinDeth,"That's irrational fear talking. AC units have been around for a long time now, as were cars. Same goes for climate doomsday predictions. IDK which thread this is at this point but i posted one link in one of a collection of predictions going back to the 80s that say we're doomed unless we do this and that. Years later and basically none of those predictions have come true. I don't deny there is pollution and that it should be reduced. But do it by forcing factories that send gas into the atmosphere to have high quality filters and similar things installed, take measures to make sure clean water isn't polluted by toxic materials being dumped in them. Don't take measures that make every day lives worse or hurt entire fields of work that people could make a living in. I know some countries have banned plastic bags because they are bad. My own country has not but you have to pay for them for the past few years instead of getting them for free like before. And i think that's fine, i dispose of those properly anyway. Other people however think it's borderline barbaric to still have plastic bags in use today and talk down on people using them. It's that kind of attitude that turns people off to your argument from the start. It's the modern day bullshit where people love lecturing you how you shouldn't think or talk a certain way, you shouldn't do things a certain way because it doesn't suit them. And it's always ""holier than thou"" liberals that supposedly care about other people's problems"
dcr4d2r,Oceanswave,"Yep, everything is and will continue to be fine. Modern conveniences have been around since the adobo hut and the population of the earth has stayed the same for like forever.

The temperature increase that we have seen in our lifetime should have taken 1000s, if not 100000 years. Not 150. Never has earth seen such a fast increase in temperature. And there is only one thing that could have made that happen. Us. If you spent even a few minutes learning about it yourself you might know it's not ""bogus"". We are killing the very planet we live on. And the country who contributes the most to it now has a leader that doesn't believe in it. This is a massive step back to humanity.

dcp2xzp,badgersssss,"Oh, I agree. I've just seen a lot of hysteria surrounding this. We already know that Trump does not consider climate change a hot button issue. The web page is transitioning to Trump's specific issues, so it makes sense that it would be taken down.

dcq2hj3,electroze,"Tools to measure temperature didn't even exist until Galileo in 1592 and wasn't even widely adopted until much later. If you're suggesting that you have proof of global warming ""at any point in history"" before the 1800s that would be false because global temperatures weren't accurately recorded. What was recorded was observation of the ice age and growth of glaciers in 1742, but no one suggested that the cooling then was due to human activity. Climate has always ebbed and flowed on a macro and micro scale. If measurements are correct in the last 100 years the temperature increase has been 1.33°F (0.74ºC). If measurements existed for 200 years or beyond it might show it even or slight increase or decrease. So most people are freaked out assuming it is permanent and that it could be 0.4F hotter when they die. We need to protect the planet, but I'm more concerned with being killed in a car wreck."

The scientists are like the smoke alarm informing us of something wrong. And anything we do (renewable energy sources, regulations on pollution, etc) are like the fire extinguisher. Sure, it might not save the house but it is better to try.The only thing truly different from that example is that there isn't a second house if the fire spreads.

dcp6iie,smogeblot,So my ad hominem against you is accurate. You are a science-rejecting luddite. You don't accept scientific models because we can't make a full scale planetary model to test on. You don't need computer models or a full scale planetary model to understand that adding CO2 to the atmosphere increases the insulation of the atmosphere.

This vast oversimplification of global variables shows the inherent bias and illogical approach of climate ""scientists."" A plastic globe in a glass jar under a tiny heat lamp is a pathetic substitution for a massive planet under the assault of radiation from a 5778K star. >You don't need computer models to understand that adding CO2 to the atmosphere increases the insulation of the atmosphere.So let's grant, temporarily, that CO2 might affect global temperature. You still haven't proven mankind is the greatest source of it. Then, let's grant that, too. Then you still can't prove that CO2 is the greatest factor in affecting temperature. If a single human pisses in the ocean, and we later find that there's a large build up of ammonia somewhere, which is a more likely cause: the single human, or a natural effect in the ocean? The Earth is big, with a massive ocean, and the sun is bigger still. Those are huge contributing variables. Mankind has a great ego to think himself more important than the sun or the ocean."

dcp6nrw,smogeblot,"> This is a massive simplification of the millions of planetary variables. This is also the problem with their computer models.Right, that's what the scientific method is. Co2 concentration is called a parameter.

Just because it's not mentioned on the white house site doesn't make it news. Maybe they just prioritized other pages. Maybe they just forgot.For God's sake, attack the man on the many serious mistakes he's made. Not on the omission of a phrase on a web page that he 99% didn't make himself."

dcp4rnz,PM_ME_TAPES,"""Old news"" means we're resigned to inaction forever, apparently. Now with God-empower in power and all. His [neanderthalic policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy) which was uploaded is what has people upvoting. Does it upset you, dissidents voicing their concerns?"

dcp55mh,yanksb4life,It's almost as if... 63 million people voted for him.

dcp56rz,ImWithUS,Keep science out of political agendas!! And vice versa!!

dcot5ra,Florac,"And moving to Mars is any more realistic? If lucky, within a couple decades there might be a tiny colony on Mars, with a hundred or so people. But at the rate climate change is progressing, it will be far too late for the majory of the people on Earth since even having the population of a small city(1 million or so) on Mars will probably take at least a century. I agree it's too late to avoid the consequences of climate change. But we can still do our best to minimalize them and look for solutions to adress these problems. Heck, if for example the US even spends 1% of it's military budget on climate change research instead, it could lead to great benefits."

dcosd2v,Gantzer,the insistence that lbgt/civil rights have just been nullified because its not on some damn website is pathetic. Trump cares for both blacks and lgbt as he has stated multiple times. but i guess since he has a R at the end of his name it becomes meaningless drivel. the selective hearing on is pathetic. climate change has always happened how much man has influenced the current supposed changes it is the debate. next time dont run an establishment politician in a time when populism has taken root in the voting public mind.
dcosn1b,joemac1505,"Look liberals, I believe the earth is warming. I do. I think emissions from human activity cause it to warm slightly.

dcpi462,misterhollywoo,i'm shocked somebody on reddit took what i said and created their own meaning out of my words. not wanting the government to waste money on climate change doesn't mean i'm kicking the can down the road for future generations. it means i think the free market is much better suited to deal with the issue than the government wasting my tax dollars. Solyndra literally just happened. take your reading comprehension skills elsewhere
dcppk1e,electricmink,"Typical Libertarian, blind to consequences beyond immediate profit."
dcs0k9y,misterhollywoo,"i'm not a libertarian and don't really care about profit. i just understand the free market and competition is what drives technological advancement, not government subsidies"
dcs0wwf,electricmink,"Never heard of NASA, then, I take it. Or DARPA (which gave us the internet)."
dcs5gvt,misterhollywoo,have heard of both. NASA's accomplishments are great and make me proud to be an American. but i have no qualms with companies like Space-X taking over the heavy lifting of space travel and my tax dollars going elsewhere.
dcscygo,electricmink,"You claim that the free market drives tech advancement, then brush off two instances where it didn't. Here's a little dose of reality: industry pretty much does shit to acvance science absent government grants and contracts because nobody wants to take risks (and businesses on the whole don't like technical advancement at all because they are inherently disruptive and they prefer to settle into a tested business model and rake in the cash with minimal further investment, at best funding incremental improvements in their products to keep them looking fresh and shiny for their consumer base). The bulk of major advances are made at (at least partially) grant-funded university labs or places like Boeing to fulfill government contracts.Research and development are one of the many places the free market fails."
dctie5w,misterhollywoo,"i didn't brush off anything. i said Space-X and other entrepreneurs could do the same things NASA does and guess what, they are! and yes there are technological advancements that come from government funded projects. i do not deny that. my point is it is not the most efficient way to do it nor the most efficient use of tax dollars. you can disagree, it's fine, but don't misrepresent my position."
dctkv30,electricmink,"Space-X is refining whst NASA pioneered; they would not be taking the risk had the government project not led the way and laid the fundamental groundwork. The same occurs all the time, in every field - the non-profit-driven grant-funded labs hammer out the basic science (which they can do because they won't sink if something they invest time and money into proves unprofitable) while industry looks at this established science and goes ""this....I might get a viable product out of this"" and refines what the universities and grant-funded labs have uncovered.So basically the belief that industry is the most efficient way to advance science is complete and utter bullshit - left to industry alone, science would barely advance. It'd be like the cell-phone market right now where there's such great ballyhoo because they slightly upped the clock on their processor and changed the color of the button on the case, and little real advances being made."

dcousdy,movshare,"""Climate Change"" was concevied to be a scam for schumcks to pay Al Gore's carbon credit tax and the Clinton's CCI (Clinton Climate Initiative) which was Hillary's very own federal reserve where all americans would have a nice percentage taken out of their paycheck. It's all been disclosed if you bothered to look."
dcouzm0,Sanhael,"It's a factual occurrence, the consensus of thousands of leading scientific minds worldwide -- people with no stake in Hillary's success. Its effects can be seen and felt visibly by a single individual, with temperatures gradually growing hotter year-round at a steady rate. The discussion of global warming predates the Clinton presidency; we used to talk about it in one of my elementary school classes in the 80's. The quantity of greenhouse gases that we emit into the atmosphere is staggering, and far more than plants and oceans have ever had to absorb before; it far outstrips volcanism. Not individually, but millions of cars, planes, and smokestacks combined."
dcovy80,bcechman13,Not to mention many other countries corroborating who don't give a shit about the Clintons or Al Gore. Why would France and other major countries all go along with it to make them rich?

dcos4az,,"man made climate change is a myth, and any changes in earths temperature is purely down to mother nature.But the arrogance of man thinks that have had a massive effect on the earth, and nothing could be further from the truth.there's a reason it was changed from global warming to climate change, because the status quo couldn't be kept up during the period when we had some of the worst winters and coolest summers on record.There's a reason why earth is heating up, because we are still at the tail end of an ice age, as evidenced by our polar caps still being covered in ice."

dcosgm1,,Tell you what. How about you go dump 20 million barrels of oil into a major river and tell me it has no impact on the Earth.
dcos887,probablyagiven,So all of our climate scientists are wrong?
dcosp1w,,"a lot of their results had false data injected in to them, this is a well known and well publicised fact.and 'all' scientists is a bit of a stretch, there's just as many and just as highly respected scientists and academics on both sides of the fence, so don't attempt to portray that 'climate change' is purely a one sided affair, because its far from it."
dcots2w,Nephthyzz,"not sure if you are using sarcasm here or not....I don't think any one is disagreeing that the climate is changing on its own. That is a basic fact that is taught in 5th grade science. The debate is about humans speeding up that process. Which most scientific data done by CLIMATE scientists/researchers has shown to be true.Why do you think you know more then people who dedicate their entire careers to studying this stuff? Basically every single country in the world has signed the Paris Agreement acknowledging that Man is speeding up climate change and has come together to combat it. So i don't know why people still think this is fake. Your argument that it all depends on mother nature isn't true at all. We are releasing new compounds that the earth hasn't had naturally that are man made (Such as CFC, chlorofluorocarbons) which now interact with our naturally occurring atmosphere. CFC eat away at the Ozone though and is man made thus linking climate change to being man made. If you don't know what the Ozone layer is for let me freshen up your memory. > When the ozone layer absorbs the sun's ultraviolet radiation, it creates a source of heat and regulates the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. If the ozone didn't filter the sun's ultraviolet radiation, most of it would reach the Earth's surface, which would be dangerous for plants and animals. [Source](https://www.reference.com/science/ozone-layer-5f3afce70d7830e3) for that quote So that is pretty much like if my mechanic said I need new brakes, shows me the proof that they are worn down and has verifiable data and statistics that this isn't good for my car or my personal safety and I was just like ""Nah brake wear-down is completely made up hoax to get me to buy into new brakes. FAKE!"" except with climate change it affect everyone in the world and not just me and my car."
dcp6n54,,"shitty analogy, a mechanic wont show you the brakes off another car and say, this is how your brakes look, you need to change yours, no, they will lift your car, and show you how worn your brakes are.climate change scientists have shown you the brakes from another car and said you need your brakes changed, then you say, ok change them.You cant take any government funded climate data seriously, its a known fact that their data sets had fake data in them, this is fact, there's no denying it, and it calls in to question the entire basis of the climate change models they used, fact."
dcpvs24,Nephthyzz,Lol the mechanic isn't showing you someone elses brakes. He is showing you your brakes but since he is an expert he can tell that you need new brakes. They might not be completely bad but he knows from research and experience that they are coming close to the danger area. Haha oh man. Give me a verifiable link that shows all scientific data on climate change is phony. I don't want just an opinion peice give me a scientific article or journal that proves otherwise. It's case and effect. You can't release unnatural gases and chemicals into the air and it not have an impact on something or the other. The stuff we are releasing is killing the ozone layer which is proveable by fact. Saying otherwise makes you look foolish. You are saying 196 countries (the whole world) and their experts are all wrong. So why do you think they are ALL wrong and you and the 3% who think it's a hoax are right?
dcpvuhb,,here you gohttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/globalwarming/11395516/The-fiddling-with-temperature-data-is-the-biggest-science-scandal-ever.htmlfake and manipulated data
dcqnb4i,Nephthyzz,"This whole article relies on a bloggers research. A blogger who isn't even a climate scientists. He is just a climate change denier. He is in no way qualified to say it is fake. Actually I would like you to see if you can even find anything about this guy ""Paul homewood"" who is the author of these things. Even his own blogs biography page has no details at all. Why trust this guy at all? You're argument relies on basically an anonymous blogger. To rebuttal your article though I will give you this article. http://www.factcheck.org/2015/02/nothing-false-about-temperature-data/"
dcr8kak,,"a single blogger? oh behave.but you use a source to attempt to debunk it by linking to a site where the majority of its funds come from the government.""and those adjustments are a normal and important part of climate science"" it's really not, you need completely un-molested raw data, if you adjust the base temperatures by a single one hundredth of a degree, you end up with results that are out by 10's of degrees and out by tens of decades in their timeline.you then have a government department (so impartial) trying to justify the adjustments""The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. agency responsible for monitoring national and global temperature trends, has addressed these types of adjustments several times before""""Over time, the thousands of weather stations around the world have undergone changes that often result in sudden or unrealistic discrepancies in observed temperatures""What change at a weather station could possibly change things like the recording of temperature, rainfall etc etc absolutely nothing, they have countless instruments for measuring these things, the apparatus from 60 years ago is no less accurate than modern monitoring equipment, christ things from modern temperature measurement all stem from the 18th century equipmentyeah, nothing wrong with that, completely impartial.clearly you have no idea of the importance of basing scientific calculations on completely raw data.The mere fact that raw data has been changed before being studied isn't an issue to you?"
dcrcej6,Nephthyzz,The article you linked to only mentions Paul Homewood. A guy who can't be verified is even real. His whole blog reeks of lobbyist ties. The guy is a ghost. We can't even verify he is real. He should not be trusted over verifiable work done by people with an actual career and education in climate science. He links to videos by PragerU in an attempt to discredit climate science. PragerU is run by Dennis Prager and is an ultra right Republican who is funded by fraking and oil companies. He also has a degree in anthropology and history but nothing that makes him creditable as a climate scientists. No where in Pauls blog does it mention any scientific research done by actual scientists. It's just his own research and interpretation of it. But he uses places like PragerU as evidence. Which isn't a credible source in the least bit.And saying weather monitoring technology has not improved in 60 years is absolutely absurd. Yes it's based off of stuff available 60 years ago but it has drastically been improved. It would take a whole lot of coordination between climate scientists to get 196 countries to believe climate change is real. I think that is absolutely absurd to think is even a possibility.
dcrf9fx,,"you can see the manipulated your data yourself from the source, this is fact.there's no reason to have manipulated the data."
dcsquyo,Nephthyzz,"The ones that where changed, which where only a handful where changed, took readings from other stations I'm the area to correct for variations like new buildings be constructed or removed as well as taking into consideration the methods used to take those readings. . If you are worried about accurate data then you should also take into consideration things that affect the data and don't show the TRUE raw data. If a building is blocking sun then the data won't show the true temperature. A new building will create new wind Patterns and would cast a shadow which would have an affect on the temperature readings. Same concept if you remove a building near a station. You change the wind patterns which gives you a different reading. Agree or disagree? Should this data, even though it isn't the true data, still be used since it is ""raw data""? Or should it be corrected by using other nearby stations in a process called homogenization. Which is scientifically sounds. In no way does Paul discredit this method.Most temperatures that get corrected are over oceans, and when they are corrected they are more often than not adjusted to show lower Temps instead of rising Temps. Which goes against the argument that's scientists are changing the data to look like it's heating. Berkeley Earth, a nonprofit started by climate scientists that are skeptical of global warming has even said the data is legit and the methods used in correcting station Temps are up to par and sees no undue manipulation in the data. These are scientists unlike our friend Paul Homewood. They both are skeptical but one is trying to fool and I'm going to guess it's the guy who can't even be verified to be a real person. Everybody who has any credibility is all saying it is real and has said none of the data has been manipulated in anyway to favor global warming. The only people at this point who are denying it are either tin foil conspiracy theorists, bible thumping Republicans, or people with oil ties trying to save their bank accounts."
dcsshw8,,"all of that is just drivel.temperature monitoring is taken out in the open, away from any buildings and the like that will mess with the readings.The fact is data was changed, when there is no valid reason for it to have been changed, this is undeniable fact, it doesn't matter if a single range of data was changed or data from every single station, data was changed to fit in with the governments narrative, this is fact, it's there in black and white.it calls in to question every single bit of data they have based their calculations onIf this were a court case and data was changed from the raw data that they were supplied with, it wouldn't be allowed to be entered in to evidence, and for good reason, it may even go so far as the case being struck out due to attempting to lodge any fake data making any conviction unsafe.here's a quote from the UK met office, that shares their unmolested data with you yanks, as to where they locate their weather stations and the reasons why.""Weather station sitesWeather station sites are selected to ensure that the observations are representative of the wider area around the station and not unduly influenced by local effects.Ideal siteLevel ground.No trees; buildings, or steep ground nearby that might influence the measurements.Undesirable siteWarming effect of buildings on the measurement of temperatureSheltering or shading effects of trees on the measurement of sunshine and wind.Frost hollow where overnight temperatures on still clear nights may be far lower than at neighbouring locations.Top of a hill or steep escarpment where winds will be unrepresentative of the wider area."""
dcsx2yn,Nephthyzz,"> The fact is data was changed, when there is no valid reason for it to have been changed, this is undeniable fact.Just saying ""Fact"" doesn't make it a fact. These things where adjusted in a justifiable and an appropriate way. Even a non-profit, global warming skeptical group of climate scientist have agreed that the adjustments where done correctly. Oh yeah, also these guys are not government affiliated and are also skeptical of Global warming but they still agree. Maybe because they actually know how and why these things need adjusted.Again, let me repeat that, CLIMATE SCIENTIST that are on your side are disagreeing with you about this. They don't see any wrongfully manipulated data. Actual Scientists, people with degrees in this who do this for a living are telling you that this data is not manipulated it any way to reflect that global warming is fake. You have to be in denial if you are actively ignoring experts in favor of your opinion and an anonymous bloggers ""research.""It seems like your whole argument about this is ""The government! Fake data!"" but you have only referenced one article as a source. Which as been discredited by Scientists doing the same work as he is who are also skeptical of Global Warming. Even his own team disagrees with his ""research.""And yeah that's the ideal site but how long do you think that has been in active practice? 50 years? 100 years? Do you think Africa has the same set of standards that the UK does? Do they have the same standards as the US? Are we all using the same equipment? Same methods? A lot are located in cities/airports which typically show higher temps because city temps usually suffer from ""Urban heat island effect."" If we didn't adjust for that it would show and even higher temp. So should we leave that as ""Raw data?"" Even if it is manipulated by the surrounding man made environment? It would work against them to adjust some city data but they do it anyway.UK Met Office's HadCRUT, NASA's GISTEMP, NOAA's MLOST and the Japanese Meteorological Agency are the four main meteorology agencies in the world. Each of them has their own methods and work independently. They don't often share that data. The funny thing is, all their models show a significant increase in global temperatures. [They are nearly identical.](http://www.climatechangenews.com/2015/01/16/from-buckets-to-beehives-how-scientists-collect-climate-data/_)Now show me proof that these are wrong. Facts, show me the data was manipulated in a manner that scientist should frown upon. An academic journal or something along those lines. Not just a news article about an unidentifiable bloggers research."

dcpbc0m,Tatalebuj,"While I personally don't believe what Trump is suggesting, your question seems rather easily answered so I'm wondering why you asked?Obviously the money being spent on Climate Change is still enriching people, even if it's being spent on a good cause. The cost of Recycling, the cost of buying extra filters and people to check quality levels, and the cost for scientist to go out and do research, all come from somewhere and that money is paid to people.If you go back to 1980 there was no real ""green"" movement and there wasn't much money involved then. Now it's over a billion dollar a year industry, and the way they make that industry work is by scaring people into thinking the world is going to end via pollutants and that by buying specific products from specific companies you, the average person, can help stave off the end of the world.Obviously we need to do something about climate change, but please don't pretend that there aren't scammers (as there are in every industry) who are using government regulations to force companies to pay for their services to either ""improve"" their quality standards or to ""verify"" they meet with those same standards.At least, that's why I think your question was obvious."
